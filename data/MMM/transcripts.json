{"2008": [{"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 4, "year": 2007, "date": "2008-02-28 13:14:08", "content": "Executives: Joel Moskowitz - Chairman and CEO Jerry Pellizzon - CFO David Reed - President of North American Operations Michael Kraft - President of Nuclear and Semiconductor Products\nAnalysts: Pierre Maccagno - Needham & Company Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan Josephine Millward - Stanford Group Gary Liebowitz - Wachovia Jason Simon - JMP Securities Michael French - Morgan Joseph Ferat Ongoren - Citigroup\nOperator: Welcome to the Ceradyne 2007 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Hosting Ceradyne's call today is Mr. Joel Moskowitz, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Accompanying Mr. Moskowitz are Jerry Pellizzon, Chief Financial Officer, and David Reed, President of North American Operations. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Moskowitz. Please go ahead, sir.\nJoel Moskowitz: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Q4 and full year '07 teleconference. We are very pleased to be here. Driving to work here in sunny California was a beautiful day. The sun is out. It's a prettier day than our stock prices right now. But maybe we can shed some of that sunlight on our company. Additionally, here is Michael Kraft, the President of Nuclear and Semiconductor Products. Before I begin my remarks I would like to make the following preliminary comments. The matters discussed in this conference call may include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future performance of Ceradyne that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year-ended December 31, 2007, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'd also like to advise you and repeat the information that Dennis just provided that we are making a recording of this conference call. Earlier today, before the stock market opened, Ceradyne issued a press release regarding reporting our fourth quarter and 12 month 2007 financial results. I'd like to review that with you, and as we have done in the past we will be pleased to go in to a question-and-answer mode after I review the press release. In the fourth quarter of 2007, our sales increased to $191.4 million, which compares to $178.7 million in the Q4 of '06. The net income was down 6.7%, about $2.5 million to $35.2 million or a $1.28 per diluted share that compared to $37.7 million, or a $1.38 per diluted share last year in the fourth quarter. Fully diluted average shares outstanding for the fourth quarter were 27.6 million, which compared to 27.4 million in the same period in 2006. Our gross profit margins were 39.6% of net sales in Q4 '07, that compared to 40.7% in 2006 Q4. And our provision for income taxes was up a bit 33.7% in the fourth quarter of '07, which compared to 33.3% in the fourth quarter of '06. For the 12 months, our sales for the year ending December 31 '07 reached a record of $756.8 million, which was up from $662.9 million in the same period last year. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased to a record $144.3 million or $5.20 per diluted share on 27.7 million shares, compared to last year at $128.4 million or $4.69 per fully-diluted-share on 27.4 million shares for the year ended December 31, '06. New bookings for the fourth quarter '07 were $258 million, which compares to $313.5 million for the same period last year. And for the 12 months ending December 31, '07 new bookings were $651.3 million, which compares to $730.1 million in '06. And the ending backlog was $238.9 million as of December 31, '07, which compares to last year at December 31, '06 of $344.3 million. And additionally, as we usually do at the end of the release, we have the balance sheet and income statements. And of course we've filed our 10-K. In the press release, which was a little more lengthy than our usual, we went on to state that we were pleased in the fourth quarter financial performance. It allowed us to meet our guidance which we had made early in '07 of $720 million to $740 million and in sales in the range of $5.20 to $5.40 per fully-diluted-share. It was also consistent with our October 30, 2007 comment that we would meet our 2007 guidance with sales at the upper range and our earnings at the lower range. I repeated in this press release our guidance on October 30th for 2008. I think it might be helpful to read it again as some of you may not actually have this release. In the past, we have issued forward full-year guidance in the prior year once we felt we had reasonable visibility. Remember, this is what we said on October 30th. Due to the potential magnitude of the BULL combat vehicle, as well as the five-year XSAPI/ESAPI proposal, neither of which has been awarded, we are providing the following guidance with an unusually wide range. The lower range reflects all of our current business units, as well as body armor, which was reduced somewhat from the current shipping level, even though multi-year XSAPI/ESAPI orders will not be issued until early 2008. But it does not include any production of the BULL combat vehicle. The higher end of the range includes the lower end plus production of the BULL combat vehicle in the second half of 2008. During our October 30, 2007 conference call, we stated that our initial 2008 guidance was sales in the range of $780 million to $1.067 billion and earnings in the range of $5.60 to $6.65 per fully-diluted-share. Our press release goes on to state that we now believe, based on recent discussions and events, that the above 2008 guidance should be modified for the following reasons. Early this month, that is February, and to remind the listeners, on October 30th, we had anticipated that we would be bidding the XSAPI/ESAPI early in December, and that was subsequently extended for the fifth time to early February. However, early this month Ceradyne did submit its proposal for a five-year supply of both ESAPI (Enhanced Small Arms Protective Inserts) and XSAPI. The total of the anticipated award is estimated at $1.2 billion as an ID/IQ (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity) contract. We believe that this contract will be awarded to multiple bidders in a similar manner as the prior and current SAPI and ESAPI contracts.  Because of our past performance and manufacturing capacity in our Lexington, Kentucky, and Costa Mesa, California facilities, we anticipate a favorable win percentage of delivery orders, primarily XSAPI. However, due to the multiple delays and extensions the government has granted, we believe that shipments against this anticipated order will not begin until the fourth quarter of 2008. Based on the delivery schedule under our current ESAPI contract, there will be a four-month gap between completion of this contract and the expected commencement of the XSAPI shipments. Relying on non-binding discussions with the government, we do not believe that there will be extensions of the current order as there were in Q3 and Q4 2007. Our intention with the Army's concurrence is to stretch out the current ESAPI contract through Q3 2008, with the anticipation that a new contract for XSAPI will be in place by the Q4 2008. Although we anticipate additional ESAPI sustainment orders, as well as other body armor orders, the net result will be a reduction in 2008's body armor shipments of approximately $80 million from the amount that was included in our initial 2008 guidance. To rationalize our armor-related costs, we are reducing our workforce by approximately 234 employees, and reducing certain other body armor variable costs. Over 50% of these reductions will be temporary workers, and the balance will be mostly hourly workers hired in the past 12 months. We have also informed the Army that we can return to our former level of production, if required, within 60 days. Due to projected offsetting 2008 increases in solar ceramic crucibles and other non-defense business, the net estimated reduction in our initial 2008 revenue guidance is $65 million. After the award of the $18.1 million prototype BULL contract (MRAP II) to Ceradyne and its partners, Oshkosh Truck, and Ideal Innovations on December 19, 2007 we and our partners were able to obtain substantially better pricing on materials and subcomponents which we have passed on to the government, making us much more competitive, but resulting in lower potential revenue from this program. This reduction in revenue was also reflected in the revised 2008 guidance which follows. Due to the potential magnitude of the BULL combat vehicle program, as well as the five-year XSAPI/ESAPI proposal, neither of which has been awarded, we are providing the following revised guidance with an unusually wide range. The lower range reflects all of our current business units, even though multi-year XSAPI/ESAPI orders will not be issued before Q3 2008, but does not include any production orders for the BULL combat vehicle. The higher-end of the range includes the lower-end, plus production of the BULL combat vehicle in the second half of 2008. Based on the foregoing factors, our revised 2008 guidance is a sales range of $715 million to $836 million, with an earnings range of $4.55 to $5.05 per fully-diluted-shares. I went on to comment that we continue to pursue our growth strategy of internal expansion of our manufacturing capacity as well as selected strategic acquisitions. Our strong position of cash and marketable securities at year-end should enable us to act quickly as opportunities present themselves. Our goal continues to be revenues in excess of $1 billion by 2010, evenly distributed between defense and non-defense markets, with an international and product diversification focus. A few selected recent activities follow. Solar Energy Ceramic Crucibles: We have selected an approximately 12-acre site near our current plant in Tianjin, China, and plan to construct 200,000 square feet of additional manufacturing capacity to meet the increasing demand for ceramic crucibles to produce polycrystalline photovoltaic silicon for solar panels. Our plan is to have this factory running towards the end of 2008. Additionally, we are expanding our ceramic crucible manufacturing capacity at our factories near Atlanta, Georgia. We believe our shipments of these solar-related products will increase from $11 million in 2007, to an estimated $50 million, to $60 million this year in 2008, and to well over $100 million in 2009. Our 2007 acquisition of our raw material supplier Minco will provide us a reliable source of high purity raw materials to support this expansion. Next comment was on ESK Ceramics, in Kempten, Germany. During the first half of 2008, we will complete about $20 million of the capital expenditures for the expansion of manufacturing capacity at our ESK Ceramics subsidiary in Kempten, Germany. The products are principally boron nitride powders for cosmetic applications as well as powders and components for metallurgy and thermal management. The second product expansion is primarily silicon carbide industrial seal and bearing components. The total additional capacity for these growth markets is $25 million per year. The next item was the BULL Combat Vehicle. Team BULL, which is Ceradyne, Inc., Oshkosh Truck, and Ideal Innovations, shipped its first BULL, also called them MRAP II, vehicles earlier this month and plans to complete the six prototypes on time. We believe the testing is progressing smoothly, with excellent performances. We anticipate a production decision by the government early in the second quarter of 2008. Ultimately, the production decision will rely, not only on our performance, but also on the government's perception of the need in the field for this advanced state-of-the-art combat vehicle and our BULL product-offering compared to the competitive environment. Acquisitions: The 2007 acquisitions of Ceradyne Boron Products, formerly EaglePicher Boron, and Minco have been successfully integrated into Ceradyne's other operations and are performing at or above our expectations. We continue to explore strategic acquisition opportunities in both defense-related and industrial applications, and we expect additional acquisitions to be made this year. The balance of the release involved the announcement of this conference call as well as description of Ceradyne and additional Safe Harbor language. Also included, as I mentioned earlier, was the income statement for the quarter and the year, as well as the balance sheet as of year-end. Before we go into Q&A, I will turn it over Jerry Pellizzon, our Chief Financial Officer who may want to make some comments on the balance sheet items, income statements, and our cash flow as it looks for the rest of the year. Jerry?\nJerry Pellizzon: Thank you, Joel, and good morning, everyone. Free cash flow, as we redefine as net income plus depreciation; amortization less capital expenditures; and including the impact of working capital during the quarter-ended December 31, 2007 was $50,848,000, compared to $11,800,000 in '06. Year-to-date, we produced a $111 million of free cash flow versus $103 million the year before, and it's interesting to note that we're projecting that we will match that free cash flow in 2008, despite reduced earnings. Our EBITDA for the quarter was $63 million, compared to the same number in '06. Year-to-date; we produced $257 million of EBITDA compared to $217 million in the year before. Depreciation amounted to $26.7 million in '07 compared to $18 million in '08. Our CapEx for the year was $42 million and in '06 it was $36 million, and we're planning about $49 million of CapEx in 2008. Our DSOs for the year-end were 39 days day sales upstanding versus 66 in the year prior to that. Joe?\nJoel Moskowitz: Thanks Jerry. I think that the most efficient way to proceed since I'm sure there is a lot of interest in not only what we're doing, but our projections for the rest of the year and some other exciting things that are happening. The best way is just to go into Q-&-A mode. Dennis?\nOperator:  (Operator Instructions). Your first question will come from the line of Pierre Maccagno with Needham.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham & Company: Hi, Joel and Jerry.\nJoel Moskowitz: Good morning Pierre.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham & Company: So regarding the BULL, if could you explain why your decision to pass along the savings to the government which translates into lower revenues and so based on that, what is the build in the ASPs that you're assuming and your margins remained the same?\nJoel Moskowitz: Yeah, I'll let Dave fill that question. The question Dave was, why do we pass on the savings directly to the government that we got, when we got all these revised bids on the BULL that supplies materials and subcomponents?\nDavid Reed: Here we felt that in the first round when we bid the program, there was a lot of uncertainty in the actual pricing of that material. As you know much of that material is on the DX rated contracts. So on the original bids we were not able to secure conformations that we could get the lowest possible pricing and as we moved into the second phase of the program, we found out that those programs would be the DX rated that we would be able to get that favorable pricing. And because of that we pass that savings on to make our program the most competitive, it could be against the rival and MRAP II vehicles were playing against.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham & Company: So you are now more competitive than anybody else you would say?\nDavid Reed: I think we're extremely competitive, I don't know all those numbers, it's impossible to know that right now here. But I think the vehicle we've offered to the government is an outstanding performing vehicle and I think the price is not one that will make them hesitate to purchase the vehicle.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham & Company: So the ASP now, I guess the last time you said it was about $0.5 million per vehicle, and so what are you assuming now, half of that, more or less?\nJoel Moskowitz: We didn't say that, last time I think someone on the phone had suggested the MRAP I were about $0.5 million, but we're right in the process peer of working on this ever changing landscape. I would be very uncomfortable in throwing out actual price units. I think that's sufficient to say that I support Dave in what he said. We passed these numbers along. It didn't really affect the margins all that much and they put us right we think in the driver seat subject to the different conditions that we've outlined in our press release.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham & Company: Would your margins be the same versus what you had before, your assumption as before?\nJoel Moskowitz: They'll be a little bit less but not much.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham & Company: Okay. And the number of vehicles?\nJoel Moskowitz: Well, we don't know. We've gotten some input but it's not worth even speculating about it. In our numbers that you see, we've estimated in '08 we could ship about 300 vehicles. That's where that number comes from the Delta from no BULL to BULL.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham & Company: So that hasn't changed basically in your assumptions?\nJoel Moskowitz: Well, we are. We registered a bit because it looks like instead of March, this could easily be a June or so decision making.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham & Company: Okay. And then regarding the body armor, the reason for the push back or that the government is taking so long, do you have any idea?\nDavid Reed: Well, the last time we spoke Pierre, we were supposed to have submitted the bids on December 8th; they pushed that back to February 8th. All of the bids have been submitted by us and the competition and now the government has just begun testing those inserts. So with that push back, they moved their award dates back considerably mainly because they have many variants that have come in from us and from the various other competitors. And they're going to have to shoot that entire product to do the final valuation and ranking of all of those inserts, both hard armor and flexible armor. So they have given themselves some cushion. We're hopeful that they will move through that quickly. We've lobbied extensively with the government and with the army to make sure that they keep that evaluation going as fast as possible.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham & Company: But your sense of their commitment to transition to XSAPI seems to be the same growth?\nDavid Reed: As far as I can tell, yes, the army has said that they have seen the threat; I think most people know that that threat is already a friendly fire issue. The US Army uses that new threat in some of our automatic weapons. So it's definitely in the field by us. So there's a friendly fire issue. And also we believe that there are some incidences in the field now that we have seen that are used by the opposition. So I believe based on our conversations with the government that they have every intention to move to a higher level of protection for the soldiers in the theater.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham & Company: Then lastly this four months gap, there's going to be the three months of the third quarter going on to the first month of the fourth quarter, is that right? And then what gross margins would you be expecting in, I mean, to grow to in the third quarter?\nDavid Reed: Well, our original ESAPI contract ran out at the end of May and we have stretched that out with the army now, so that it will run through the end of September. We expect that they will make awards in August or early September for deliver in October. As you heard in the press release, we have made some reductions across the Board and personnel and we expect that our margins will hold up pretty well with that. That can't be exactly the same because you're not spreading the fixed cost over the same amount of product but overall we won't be too much different for you.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham & Company: So this gap in four months would be what September, October, November, December?\nDavid Reed: No, the gap would have been, if we had not stretched our schedule at the end of May we would've completed all of our ESAPI production and then in June, July, August and September we would not have had any ESAPI to produce and deliver to the army. And so we've spread out our existing order over instead of five months this year, nine months this year, so that we have a level run of production in our hot pressing and body armor assembly areas.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham & Company: Oh, I see, okay, I understand. Okay. Thank you very much. Joel Moskowitz Thank you, Pierre.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Morgan.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan: Good morning, guys.\nJoel Moskowitz: Hi, Al.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan: Just a follow-up on the body armor production. Does that mean you may take one of the lines down, or is it just really like you said reducing the output from each of the line by keeping them all running somewhat efficiently I guess?\nDavid Reed: Well, we still have very strong business on our side plate programs with the army and most of those products are made in Costa Mesa. So the Cost Mesa hot pressed facility will be running pretty close to full capacity throughout that time period and most of the reduction is in our chest protector business which is done primarily in our Lexington, Kentucky facility. Also there we will not be shutting down any line but will be slowed down by about a third on all three of those lines. We don't want to ramp down anything because then you will have equipment that's not being utilized day-in and day-out and recovering that to full capacity is a little more difficult than when you cycle it every day, every week.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan: Right. In addition then to the testing, what are the data points or maybe said differently, what is the information flow that the company can expect and therefore we should as to either the ramp up or the awarding of this, because it's possible that through stretching in the south four additional months that in 2009 we may have further cut in the level?\nDavid Reed: I am not sure I understand that comment a further cut in the level out.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan: Well, in terms of production rates and then how much you're going to be producing, I mean I guess you need another contract right at some point in second half of this year?\nDavid Reed: Yeah, as I said earlier the government has indicated that they expect to make awards in the August to September time period, so they have given themselves many, many months to test these inserts. I don't anticipate they will need anymore time, that's probably the longest review period the army has ever had for a program of this magnitude. So they should be able to get through that cycle and it's possible they could even complete it sooner than that. It just depends on how the testing goes at the lab, but we expect that those awards will be made and they've indicated deliveries to start in October of this year.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan: All right. Just a little maintenance on the guidance for '08, Jerry. Do you have any charges in there or included in there for some of these cost reduction programs or efforts in terms of employees or are those going to be called out separately in the guidance?\nJerry Pellizzon: No, we reflect what we anticipate will happen. There are some cost savings programs that we put through in '08 versus '07. We had a logistics savings program on our freight that was credited towards '08 and recognized in the guidance. So we have our programs in there. We have all our costs of severance, etcetera, etcetera. So I think everything as much as possible is according to GAAP and fully loaded.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan: And then Joel, maybe just a bigger picture question in terms of the direction here on the BULL. If I look at the revised guidance, it looks like it's down basically $0.55 to a $1.05. But I think I heard you indicate that there it still remains on the high end of the range, a little bit of the BULL end there. So what's giving you confidence either the June or some time in '08 the company could receive a production order or why wouldn't you just take out the BULL guidance and let us (inaudible)?\nJoel Moskowitz:  What we have is no BULL guidance on the low end of the range, there is not one vehicle in there.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan: All right.\nJoel Moskowitz: And on the high end of that range as I said there's about 300 vehicles laid in '08. \nJerry Pellizzon:  So Al, the difference between $5.05 and $4.55.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan: Yes.\nJerry Pellizzon: That $0.50 there is the impact of the Bull itself all alone.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan: Okay, all right. Little bit more constructive then on the new businesses or the new opportunities excluding solar discussion. What's going to help or drive the top line or perhaps where you're focusing some of your growth dollars in?\nJoel Moskowitz: Sure. I'm glad you asked that question because obviously we are sticking to our netting so to speak on the movement to non-defense as well as some defense areas. The solar even though you wanted not to talk about it, I do want to mention that every time we get additional projections from our Atlanta operations, they are going up. And the actual number we have in our plan which is now moving up was $53 million. And when I asked the other day how much of that is booked or committed based on specific customers, it was 48. So in other words, we have something like 9% somewhat. So we're pretty optimistic on solar because the polycrystalline materials are really one of the processes which are here and now and fairly mature and a lot of expansion. We're looking at 35% growth a year and as I said recently to our own staff, the sun isn't going out any time soon and so that we have a very long viewpoint. In the other areas that I talked about before, I have mentioned ESK because we are out of capacity now on the cosmetic boron nitride. We're expanding that and I mentioned the seals of which we put out. We've got some of the largest orders for ESK, they ever got from their two largest customers in Europe for the seals silicon carbide. And for some of the more future where in the past I said there are really two product lines that could end up bringing a $1 billion worth of revenues to Ceradyne, one is the combat vehicles and I think where we are, I think we discussed that earlier and the other is a major revision to the methodology of smelting aluminum that would use our advanced non-oxide materials made in Germany, that's progressing out. I know that it is, as recently for example in January we've got 12 on order for 12 tons of aluminum related ceramics. I don't know any other products that they ordered by the ton, except maybe the boron nitride for cosmetics and that's small quantities. Now we are involved with almost every major aluminum company in the world. There were meetings, extensive meetings in Europe as recently as this month in France and Germany and I continue to believe that is one of the future opportunities of Ceradyne. We are investigating and planning. You'll see no impact in '08, well a little bit, I just told you, we got 12 tones. But I think in '09 you'll begin to see product moving for what is called a drain cathode and then there will be other products at the end of '09 and into 2010. We're seriously considering expanding our operations away from Germany, perhaps in the manufacturing of titanium diboride and all the other areas that we are working on an alternative energy continued to increase, albeit at smaller absolute dollars than the defense products but with good margins and very long upside. One of the areas that you and I have talked about that I want to reiterate is what they call unconventional oil which means the high viscosity oil trap and the oil sands and tar shales in Canada and Colorado where I've said repeatedly a decision would be made about that next year. We still believe that and we are going to play a very important role in that. So the company continues to move in the same areas that are discussed. One thing that we discussed internally so you'll have a little bit of flavor from management is a reduction of $80 million in defense two years ago would have been much more serious. We take it very serious and we are moving very quickly. As of this morning, we began the reductions in force that will be completed in the next 44 hours. And well it should all be taken in the context of the total company that the non-defense area, the non-body armor area has grown and will continue to grow and we're going to be very focused on that. We're looking at some acquisitions in '08 that I am comfortable and discussing, they are still in various stages of discussions, two of them are non-defense and one is in the defense area.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan: Based on the rough numbers, it looks like with an $80 million reduction that you finally broke the need to 60% barrier on the sales line, so the trend is continuing to go more favorable to diversified?\nJoel Moskowitz: I haven't actually calculated that number, but the trend is getting to, Jerry you said it was.\nJerry Pellizzon: 62%.\nJoel Moskowitz: Okay. So it will continue to move that way. I can't name another product, it's going to go from $11 million to $50 million to a $100 million in the solar sales that we're very comfortable on. We know how to make this. I've repeated it, I'd say it again I believe we have the best quality in the world because we've a secret in obtaining the purities because we use our aerospace and missile technology as it relates to radomes to make these high purity fused silica ceramic crucibles to melt silicon and because you get very low or no impurities into the silicon, you get what's a very high efficiency in converting sunlight to electricity.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan: Thanks. And one final thing again Jerry thanks for filing the K along with your earnings release. I know that's a lot of effort. I appreciate it.\nJerry Pellizzon: You're welcome.\nJoel Moskowitz: Yeah. We may let him go to sleep sometime in the next week or two, Al.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Josephine Millward with Stanford Group.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Hi, good morning.\nJoel Moskowitz: Hi, Josephine.\nJerry Pellizzon: Good morning, Josephine.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Good morning. In your guidance reduction for this four month ESAPI delivery gap, are you assuming 19,000 sets per month or is it 20,000 to 23,000 sets that you're currently shipping?\nDavid Reed: Josephine, what we were referring to was the order from the army was for 19,000 sets and we spread those five months of 19,000 over the nine-month time period. We do have other ESAPI orders. We continue to produce some of the replacement ESAPI products for the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia. We also have some orders from the Marines that continue. So we do have other products that we're making there on the lines, plus we have a continued body armor insert business from the special Ops guys.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Right.\nDavid Reed: And they are still putting a handle on what they're going to order for the year. So there is a little potential there to fill in some of this shortfall.\nJerry Pellizzon: Josephine, what we have in terms of the non-army ESAPI, the other ESAPI that Dave alluded to. I'll just quantify it; it's about $50 million of business this year.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Okay.\nJerry Pellizzon: That doesn't include the side plate, the ESPI plates.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Okay. So non-army ESAPI business is about $50 million for the year?\nJerry Pellizzon: The non-army that's right.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: In your $80 million reduction, are you including additional sustainment orders? It's my understanding that the army is skewing the process of evaluating how much sustainment they need for ESAPI post-May. So have you included any thing and if you can talk about your assumptions?\nDavid Reed: That is in the number that Jerry just stated. We do have sustainment. So far the army has looked at that getting sustainment through DSCP, not on their own.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Right. So how much sustainment have you included in the $80 million reduction because it looks like you are taking out four months for 19,000 sets, I don't see any replacement in there?\nDavid Reed: Well, the DSCP that we can get, we've already gotten one order roughly equal to a month where we got about 15,000 sets of DSCP and it looks like we'll probably get maybe up to 30 million total from them.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Okay. But so you haven't included any of that?\nDavid Reed: No, that is in the number.\nJoel Moskowitz: Remember I just said, this is Joel, the $80 million is the reduction from our prior guidance.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Right.\nJoel Moskowitz: So there was some DSCP orders in that, you are correct in that. We do know Philadelphia is discussing increasing some of their requirements, but we don't feel comfortable enough to put it in right now. We're going to work redouble our efforts of course to get them to increase it but I think it's reasonable because the 80 becomes 65 when we added some other non-defense things in there.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Okay. I understand.\nJoel Moskowitz: But there was some statement in the original October 30 guidance.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Could you tell me how much sustainment you included in your guidance? I am just trying to; it seems to me that you might be a little conservative.\nJoel Moskowitz: Yeah, we might be, and I think the best thing to do unless you guys have the numbers in front of you is why don't you call Jerry offline.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Okay.\nJoel Moskowitz: And he'll have to dig out all the back up to the last guidance.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Okay. No problem. My next question is related to MRAP. Other than passing on cost savings to the government, it looks like you have also lowered your assumption in terms of number of units you can produce. I believe on the last call, you talked about maybe 500 to 600 units. Did something happen to change your outlook in terms of the maximum number you can produce? Or is it just indications from the government that they may not make a decision until later on this year?\nDavid Reed: I think the only thing that's going on there just being is that when we made the original forecast, we had thought the program might start a little earlier than we now think it will. As Joel said, we expect them to make an order some time early in the second quarter, that's when they would look to place an order and with the ramp up schedule we have given them that probably pushes us a couple of months out from what we thought we were going to do before and that gives us less vehicles that are producible in 2008 versus the original guidance that we had Josephine.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Okay. So at this point if you were to receive an order say at the end of March, you think the maximum number of vehicles that you can produce is about 300 units?\nDavid Reed: Yeah, a bit over 300 units and most of that has to do with just getting into the DX rated queue to get the types of materials streaming into the battery that we would need to ramp up.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Okay. And can you give us an update on LTAS in light of your recent order from Oshkosh?\nDavid Reed: Yeah, we feel really good about LTAS Josephine. We have gotten a letter from the army telling us that our system is accepted by them for a threshold LTAS. We've now started to share that information with all of our customers that resulted in an initial order from Oshkosh as we announced to make a prototype cap for them and we really think that that positions us, we may be the only other option they have other than aluminum metal to build out these vehicles that the army and marines are going to be looking for over the next five years. I think you've seen some of those recent announcements that they\u2019ve asked for numbers by early this summer from both the army and the marines to add into their palm so that they can figure out how many exact vehicles they require \"A\" kit, \"B\" kit strategy on and we think we can offer all of those OEMs up to a 35% to 40% freight savings over the existing solutions they had to work with. So I think we've got a step up on most of our competitors there and we're really anxious to move ahead on those programs that they come through later this year and into '09.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Are you still expecting about $10 million to $20 million from LTAS this year from OEMs? Or can you give us an estimate of what your expectations are for '08 and possibly '09? I don\u2019t know if you've got any results from, you talked about doing a study with a Washington consultant on LTAS potential; I don't know if you have an update for us on that?\nDavid Reed: We don't have any high numbers in there for LTAS this year. We expect that activity will start in '09. We expect to complete several reiterations of prototypes throughout the year that will probably be less than $5 million in total business when it's all said and done. But the upside for the fleet, the army is talking about up to 40,000 vehicles over the next five years and their own internal estimate is that's about $2 billion worth of add-on armor in the \"A\" and \"B\" Kit. So it's a very large market that we're playing in and we believe we have some exceptional products to help them reduce the load on there drive trains.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Okay. So you said that army's estimate...\nJoel Moskowitz: And Josephine, this is Joel. You'd ask about the study that we've commissioned.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Right.\nJoel Moskowitz: We don't have the results on that yet. There is a big meeting here in California. I think March 9th Dave?\nDavid Reed: Yes.\nJoel Moskowitz: And the Washington Group that's doing the study will present their initial findings.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Okay. So, going back to what you were saying the army's estimate of LTAS is up to $2 billion over the five years, did I hear you right?\nDavid Reed: Yes, that's their estimate of up to 40,000 vehicles required by the army alone. And they are estimating the costs could be between $25,000 to $50,000 per vehicle for these \"A\" kit, \"B\" kit add-ons.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: The question for you on the order from Oshkosh, is there a reason why it was just a \"B\" Kit because I thought the OEMs are integrating the \"A\" kit and the \"B\" kit was optional? And when do you expect to have, I guess what's the next step with Oshkosh, will you make more prototypes, or are you expecting some sort of production order in the near future?\nDavid Reed: That order is actually for the HEMTT, the A3 that's the all composite version. So it is a \"B\" kit, they are interested to outfit this first one and then drive the vehicle around, see what impact if any it has on the composite cab and then I am sure there'll be some design issues that we will have to deal with later in the year. And so it will be a typical prototype and development effort for them and then now have that option to offer to the government.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Okay. But what about the \"A\" kit, are they evaluating \"A\" kits as well?\nDavid Reed: We have given them some solutions on \"A\" kit, the \"A\" kit portion is typically not the driver in the dollars, it's typically just some installed firewall in your feet area of the vehicle and may be a couple segments in the pillars and so it's not a big driver for the total dollar value, the \"B\" kit is what attaches on to the outside of the vehicle and provides all of the coverage side front, back, top. So that's where the real dollars are and that's what we are focusing on.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Gary Liebowitz with Wachovia.\nGary Liebowitz - Wachovia: Good morning, gentlemen. Joel Moskowitz Good morning, Gary.\nGary Liebowitz - Wachovia: Jerry and Joel, I am just trying to get my hands around the guidance, if I look at the low end of the EPS and the revenue ranges for 2008, by my math it suggested about 28% pre-tax margin for the full year, that's what you did in the second half of '07. But it seems like going into '08 you have the major headwind of your most profitable business being somewhat down, what is working to offset that?\nJoel Moskowitz: We've had some cost savings in various programs, but really it's the expansion of the crucible business that's helping that out and we are also implementing cost saving programs here in Costa Mesa and (inaudible) armor programs to drive that margin up, even though we believe in the back half of the year it's little to slightly lower, but the headwind is, general improvement in our industrial business and also included in that is the Solar Energy business, photovoltaic cells, the crucibles that we anticipate will have higher margins in '08 as opposed to '07. To give you some color on that, Gary, we are expanding our facilities in China for the production of crucibles. We are building, we are in the process now, we are organizing the development and building of a 200,000 square foot facility in near Tianjin to provide additional production capacity to meet the further growing demand in that business.\nGary Liebowitz - Wachovia: Okay. And also can you talk about what happened in the Canadian subsidiary in the quarter, it looks like the loss was somewhat worsened. I know you have been thinking that would be break-even by year end, but it just seems like the ramp up there is not going as planned.\nJoel Moskowitz: Yeah, I think that's a correct observation. It was a small operation. We expected it to do better as we came to the year end and the business and the shipment levels just have not materialized. Also the projections are quite strong in '09. We have a significant facility there and we have two new development areas, one is a product called BORTEC and the other of course is implementing the enriched boron from our Eagle Picher operation. But we are concerned about it, the key thing in looking at it is it small and we can control that operation. That's under Michael Kraft. Michael, do you want to have any input on that?\nMichael Kraft: Well, yeah, just a little bit to add to that Joel. We had a change in material that we used to produce the heats and so we've had a little bit of a delay in that change. Everything else is going according to plan. We're going to have record this year in the shipment of our BORAL product line which is the first product line and primary material that we ship out of that factory, as well as I am scheduled to put our new rolling mill up in (inaudible) and that's planned for Q2. So everything is being built out and we look for a really strong year in '09.\nJoel Moskowitz: The rolling mill that Michael just talked about, that's the state-of-the-art that will probably be one of the few of only, the only one in that area, the world of that magnitude and they saw a lot of interest and that really expands our capabilities. But we will watch it, we've gone to -- I personally have visited with our major customer in Paris and nukes are in and they are going to create a lot of waste products and we got to make sure that we're there. The product coming out of legal picture is probably the best in the world. It's on the pricey side, so we have to look to areas where they are worried about physical size, but your observation is correct we're go to be watching that very carefully.\nGary Liebowitz - Wachovia: But also Jerry on capital spending, I guess you had some issues with permitting an ESK in the prior quarter, sounds like those have been resolved?\nJerry Pellizzon: No, I don't recall that. Right now, we're making an acquisition of some property contiguous to that plant. For the year we're going to spend about $49 million, $50 million in CapEx. That includes our expansion at the ESK and our expansion in China. As I've mentioned before that we're very, very excited about. But everything is on par now. I don't recall any permit issues right now.\nJoel Moskowitz: What we're referring to is (inaudible) 22-acre site we have there, 530,000 square feet of manufacturing. They were looking to sell some buildings as well as some undeveloped land and we wanted to buy it, so that we wouldn't be landlocked. And I think that's what you're referring to. We had to get the okay of some of the surrounding neighbors and that sort of thing. That's all on stream, in fact the deal may be done, I'm really not sure of that.\nDavid Reed: But Joel, we're going to fund that probably within two weeks.\nJoel Moskowitz: Okay. So you can consider it effectively done. But even when we buy that additional property there is nothing immediate that will change.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Jason Simon with JMP Securities.\nJason Simon - JMP Securities: Good morning guys.\nJoel Moskowitz: Good morning, Jason.\nJason Simon - JMP Securities: The question would be about the MRAP II program and what you believe the potential size of the upcoming order would be not for yourselves but for the total order for the market?\nDavid Reed: We've heard up to maybe 3,000 vehicles, but again as Joel said earlier Jason we don't really know, that's currently in review by both the army and the marines for how many of the MRAP I are going to settle in on and what if anything they're going to do with the MRAP II. Like I said earlier, we believe it's the superior vehicle, it's on the best available chassis it's got a great drive. We had great reviews for our category two BULL, that was out at the Winter Rodeo in Reno. And we had over 200 soldiers ride through that vehicle out on a tough course and they all said it's the best riding MRAP they've ever sat in. So we felt pretty good about that.\nJason Simon - JMP Securities: Good. And I guess how many vehicles or companies have been down selected for the upcoming program?\nJoel Moskowitz: Well, right now I'll answer that. As you know they have given two orders to BAE and to team BULL of which we are part of and those are the two that we're focused on. However, the government has also said that anyone who had an MRAP I could be a competitor, could compete if they had a solution and the solution would be under their engineering changed plan, ECP where they might be able to take it for additional armor on. So it's a little bit cloudy, the competitor field. We look at it; we're competing against everyone even though BAE has got to be considered the leading competitor. I also agree with Dave Reed, I am surely not an expert on the vehicles and we don't have written reports still in the bidding and negotiating stage. But I can tell you that I am very enthused about it, included in this were 200 soldiers that went through the vehicle that was brigadier, general who also gave it a lot of praise. The reason we have the comment in our press release is that the final decision will probably be based on the real perception of the need both in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as where we stand competitively. I think it is more than a reasonable expectation if they buy an MRAP II that we have a good shot of getting a fair share of that, if not all of it. I based that on some of the comments David has made, as far as I know we are the only ones with independent suspension which means high off road capabilities in places like Afghanistan, to be on road is just to be off road.\nDavid Reed: Hey Jason that 10 manned vehicle that we demoed for everybody that they rode around in.\nJason Simon - JMP Securities: Yes.\nDavid Reed: That's the vehicle that the government blew up with the massive underbelly blast. We put it back on the road for less than $70,000 with repair works. So I don't think anybody else in the field could ever make our comment about their MRAP like that.\nJason Simon - JMP Securities: So obviously the quality performance really compares (inaudible) against MRAP I. Dave, is there a situation where they would look at the MRAP II as not being cost competitive to the MRAP I, is that they won't even take that into consideration?\nDavid Reed: I don't think so. I think we are right in there. I really do, I think that's the price we have got out there depending which MRAP I, you want to look at put us within the competitive field. So I think we are in good shape.\nJason Simon - JMP Securities: Okay. And I guess just back on the XSAPI program, the five year ID/IQ calls for $250 million run rate a year, that's kind of where you are, I think of the 19,000 set run rate I guess for the ESAPI program. What should we assume that in 2009 you're be going to be getting back to those types of numbers, the 19,000 set per month number?\nDavid Reed: Can't make that call yet. We don't know exactly what kind of a roll-out the government's going to pursue over that five year period. If they run at a high rate like they have been, they could fill up that whole thing in three years. So we think that it may be at a slightly lower level than that in total between all the competitors. So we'll just have to keep an eye on that and then update you a little bit later in the year on that Jason.\nJason Simon - JMP Securities: Thanks very much guys.\nJoel Moskowitz: Okay, Jason. We're going to take two more calls, Dennis.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Michael French with Morgan Joseph.\nMichael French - Morgan Joseph: Good morning Joel, Dave and Jerry.\nJoel Moskowitz: Hi, Michael.\nMichael French - Morgan Joseph: The first question is potential use of cash, what do you have to say about purchasing stocks and particularly at these levels Ceradyne has resources that it could be in?\nJoel Moskowitz: Well I've said on the last call that we would consider it and that's where we stand. We will seriously consider purchasing stock and the real criteria is going to be these acquisitions that we're looking at and of course the price of the stock which is now lower than it was when we talked about this on October 30th. We're considering it, we can do it, you're right we have the resources to do it and we might do it. We would be probably hesitating if we felt that within the next few months we might need that cash to do an acquisition, we certainly won't borrow to buy stock back.\nMichael French - Morgan Joseph: Okay. And other question on the guidance and following up from the last question about the XSAPI run rate, so what is the guidance assumed in terms of historic that you have three, four months of XSAPI production in the October, November, December?\nJoel Moskowitz: Yeah, the guidance assumes that we're going to be running for those three months at about, I think we put in 12,000 sets, 11,000 to 12,000 sets.\nMichael French - Morgan Joseph: That's correct. And finally on the LTAS, should we start thinking about seeing news from other OEMs like Oshkosh, any time soon or do you think they're waiting to see how this works out for Oshkosh before we see commitments from some of other vendors?\nJoel Moskowitz: Well, I think there's plenty of opportunity there for us. As I said earlier, there's going to be somewhere between 30,000 or 40,000 vehicles requiring this level for greater armor in the next five years. So we're a little bit closer to Oshkosh obviously because of some of the BULL activity and because of some of our earlier work on giving them some cab prototype. So that's the first area we're going to work with. But we'll continue to work with all the other guys. We've presented the same solution to AM General. As you know, they are buying products from us now for the existing HUMVEEs. They may be in place on some of their work to substitute this material in order to save them a little bit away.\nMichael French - Morgan Joseph: You're right. What kind of a response are you getting?\nJoel Moskowitz: They liked the weight savings; they think it's a great. But until we got their certification letter it was all meaningless because they weren't allowed to use it. The army said on LTAS, you got to have a letter from us that says this is an acceptable armor and up until four weeks ago we didn't have there letter. We got the letter now.\nOperator: And this morning's final question will come from the line of Ferat Ongoren with Citigroup.\nFerat Ongoren - Citigroup: Hi, a quick one for Jerry. Jerry, if you go back and look at the 10-K, you mentioned the auction rate north of $38 million, how should we think about those?\nJerry Pellizzon: Well, we have a portfolio including the auction rates of $225 million at the end of the year. We took the permanent impairment on part of that portfolio. We have brought some issues with the investment firm that was managing those securities with us and the fact that they didn't follow our investment policy. So it's something that we are pursuing and there was only $41 million originally of a $220 million portfolio and unfortunately it is what it is and the credit markets are in a state of disarray as you are well aware.\nFerat Ongoren - Citigroup: Sure. Are you comfortable with the rest of the portfolio?\nJerry Pellizzon: For us, that's difficult to say, there are developments every day that can swing that. Our portfolio was structured by MBIA and to the extent that they can get additional financing and shore up their balance sheet and keep their ability to rate on an AAA basis then I think we're going to come out of this fine and I think the market in my opinion will eventually come back. But it is a state of disarray; they never had failed auctions in 20 years and suddenly they are failing all over the place including municipal. So it only $40 million, I think it's rather in the scope of our balance sheet, it's rather immaterial. We've held a $150 million to $220 million of cash on our balance sheet throughout '07 and we're producing about $10 million of cash flow per month and we anticipate that without the impact of acquisitions that we're probably going to have about $330 million of cash in our balance sheet from the end of 2008.\nFerat Ongoren - Citigroup: That was a second question. I mean I would have thought that you may have given the working capital liquidation that is going to happen next year, given the [lower deliver] rate, the working capital would have been bigger plus than what the guidance implies. Is there some R&D capitalization or other types of capitalization going on relating to MRAP program?\nJerry Pellizzon: No, I think on a working capital front, I think we just as we usually do, we are pretty conservative. I think there is upside to that number, but we have to manage our inventories to slightly lower level of business. We are building up some inventories. We will be for the BULL pending that order and we will be developing facilities for the BULL to further that program and create capacity, but I think we are just being conservative with that right now\nFerat Ongoren - Citigroup: Okay. And then along the final question for Joel. Joel, you are talking about the potential opportunities in commercial, but if I'd said the bigger pieces of the commercial business, now the largest business you have is ESK, pre-tax profit was down more than 20%, cam roller business facing headwinds. Genaware is losing more money. I mean are you getting to the point where you have 10, 15 of these projects and just getting very difficult to manage them?\nJoel Moskowitz: I think that your observations have merit. The cam followers have been an issue for it's actually getting better on cam followers and Dave has, we have brought in this Vice President Ken Morris who has restructured our advanced ceramic operations here on the West Coast and I actually feel more comfortable about some of these plans. The Canadian operation as we discussed earlier is doing less than what we thought it would do. We are a quarter or two behind in getting this $2.5 million rolling mill there and the jury is out on that in the short run but it's really a small part of the total business. As far as ESK, their margins in some of their product areas are actually increasing such as their surface engineering and some of the areas are quite competitive and we are taking a hard look at that. I think that the changes we have made, remember we've made some significant management changes. The ESK has a new CEO for the first time ever since Ceradyne brought it. Thomas Juengling who is really one of our bright stars, we spent the last two years in the States. I spoke with him as recently as yesterday and he is quite on top of everything there, including the opportunity to expand. I think that we're going to have to have a little patience and watch the profit margins go up over there. They should because they are going to have additional volume. They also remember we will have some reductions because they supply us the boron carbide for the armor and Thomas is moving right on top of that. As of next week they will have reduced their force related to that primarily through some temps that they had there. So we have made changes in the management. We brought in Ken out here. We put Thomas Juengling back there and all of these are in a positive mode. The kind of looking at it as you have mentioned, I think that you are looking at it the right way. We would like to see those margins go up as the volume goes up and we're going to work real hard on that and you'll just have to see if we perform.\nFerat Ongoren - Citigroup: Okay, thank you.\nJoel Moskowitz: Okay. Dennis, that should be it.\nOperator: Okay. Gentlemen, do have any closing comments?\nJoel Moskowitz: Yeah, I do. I appreciate most of the people who have asked questions were analysts who have been following the company and have a very in depth knowledge of a lot of Ceradyne activities, particularly as they relate to armor. And one of the analysts, I think it was Al who brought up the fact that we keep increasing our percentage of non-defense business. And remember as important as defense is and I've said there were $2 billion opportunities. And that is combat vehicles and aluminum. We are going to work on both very hard. We have a lot of money in the bank and it gives us the strength to do the negotiations on some of these deals. We will shortly announce our new Vice President, a new position for Vice President of Business Development to help us put these things together and hopefully bring another smart person to the top as an officer of the corporation to help me with observation, well are we just getting a little too thin. I think we will be okay with the changes that we are currently doing. So I think that I know people have reacted negatively to the announcement. The company always tries to put out information as soon as we feel that we reasonably can rely on it. It's a moving target sometimes. I remember the question on October 30th of whether we thought there would be a delay in the next ESAPI/XSAPI after four delays and we didn't think there would be, having qualified if I say, well you never know with the government. And then within days, they extended that to February 7th which we did meet and now it's in the process. But that really has caused us to look more hard at these projections, and this is what we think is a realistic guidance. I also think that market still doesn't really value the company completely as it should in that we are doing what we said we would do as far as these other areas and we are very excited about them and we have the means to pursue it and we have the technology and we have the capacity. So as always, the numbers will be out and we are going to work very hard on maybe making these guidance numbers look conservative but it was the prudent thing to do at this time. And with that, I'll talk to you in about three months. That's it, Dennis.\nOperator: Thank you, gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's Ceradyne 2007 fourth quarter and full year results conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 3, "year": 2007, "date": "2007-10-19 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the 3M Third Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards you will be invited to participate in the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Friday, October 19, 2007. We would now like to the turn call over to 3M.\nMatt Ginter: Good morning this is Matt Ginter, Head of Investor Relations for 3M. Welcome all investors and analysts to our third quarter business review. And let me also say, it was good to see many of you are at our meeting in St. Paul last week. I have a few announcements before we begin today's meeting. As in prior quarters, we will be doing a PowerPoint presentation today. The slides are posted on our website at the moment, at 3m.com, so can you pull them up there. These slides will remain on our website, along with an audio replay of today's call for an extended period of time. During the call today, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. And these statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. On our call today, we have George Buckley, our CEO and Pat Campbell, our CFO. Both will make some formal comments and would get to your questions. There are a number of other companies reporting today and we all know how busy you are during the earnings season. So we will keep the call today to one hour. We will try to be... move swiftly. We will answer as many questions as we can. If you could please limit to one question and one follow-up, we will do that and if you have a follow-up question beyond that, get back in the queue and we will do everything in our power to get to you. If not, we will be around all day to answer any follow-up questions, that is, Bruce and I. So you please now go to slide number three and I would like top turn the program over to George.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Thank you very much Matt. Good morning everybody. First of all, I want to thank many of you were able to join us at our meeting in St. Paul, last week. I very much appreciate your participation and your interest in this great company. I know that the time and commitment you gave to us was significant and we are very grateful for that. From my point of view, we had two very productive days and I hope that you'll now have a better idea of why we are so optimistic about 3M's long-term future. We'll obviously avoid repeating here what we told you just a few days ago. From your point of view, I hope that we help remove some of the mystery about our company and provided some insight into our approach to operational excellence and discipline, into our commitment to invest in technology and innovation and new products, and how the underlying strength of our broad and diverse portfolio carries us forward. The access that we provided also to our scientists and to our engineers, to our manufacturing people, to our various product specialists and to management also, should have been very helpful. So let's now turn to the third quarter. This was clearly another good quarter for 3M. Obviously not everything went perfectly and it never does, but given some tough end-markets in the U.S., many things did. The strength of our portfolio was evident again in the third quarter results. All of our businesses posted positive worldwide local currency sales growth on our way to a record third quarter sales of $6.2 billion. Other preferred [ph] growth a little bit above 9.4%, absence sales lost in divestitures, which we saw in the third quarter, but we clearly move in the right direction. It was, overall, a strong quarter and especially strong in healthcare, which grew 20.6%. Europe and Latin America also exhibited similar strength, with both regions posting double-digit sales growth. I am also pleased with our EPS growth of more than 10%, especially in the context of the extra investments that we've been making in R&D supply chain and in advancing our brands. We have shown that, we are indeed able to maintain premium margins while accelerating our investments, giving us additional confidence that our longer-term plan is on-track. To say on track is important, as we continue those investments in growth, especially internationally. If these numbers... in these numbers we absorbed a total of $35 million of commodity inflation in the quarter. So, as we reminded you last week, we continue to work our long-term growth plan, while getting the job done in the short term also. We know well enough that eggs today are sometimes better than chickens tomorrow, but having said that, investment in R&D is tracking to end the year at an increase of 10% more than it was last year. We are also working hard to drive international growth through brand building and making use of local and regional brands where they make sense. This also seems to be working well. Our supply chain is being strengthened and streamlined. We are investing 35% more in CapEx than last year and so far have brought on-stream this year five new plants outside the United States. We also announced two further acquisitions in the month of September, this makes 15 acquisitions year-to-date and I wouldn't be surprised if we announced a few more before the year is out. So all in all, a strong third quarter; we continue to work our plan and we are as confident as ever in our long-term future. In our investor meeting, we highlighted that 3M's success over the long-term is defined by our ability to apply ongoing innovation to build what we call Engineering Franchises. Franchise like Scotch tape, Post-it notes, Trizact brand abrasives and Scotch-Brite brand reflective sheeting. We also explained that we are looking hard to extend that concept of an Engineering Franchise into our optical-film business. Similar to the other examples, we invented the basic technology. As the market changed, we historically moved to serve all market segments from the bottom to the top of the market. So, today we are also doing that same thing in optical. We don't still foresee any technological substitution of LCD TVs in particular, in high volume to many years to come, so this is a great long-term market. But it is essential that we better serve all the segments included the faster-growing but more turbulent lower levels, where for a while, we can expect further pricing and margin pressure over time. For now this is the area of highest growth as customers seek out to receive higher value. I want to reinforce what I told you last week, it's our firm intention to protect and build that optical franchise, in order to extend and strengthen our position over the long term. To apply our technology, our market knowledge and our manufacturing prowess in the same way that we build the engineering platforms, I had mentioned earlier. So, thanks for your attention, I'll now turn the call over to Pat for more in-depth discussions of our results.\nPatrick D. Campbell: Thank you George and good morning everyone. As George indicated this quarter, we demonstrated the strength of our portfolio from both a business and geographic perspective. For the second consecutive quarter, we had sales greater than $6 billion. We maintained strong operational discipline while at the same time continue to invest in the business to drive long-term sustainable shareholder value, all consistent with the themes we talked about in last week's investor meeting. As explained in our press release this morning and shown on slide number five, third quarter reported earnings per share were $1.32. Included in this result are two special items, which I would like to explain in some detail for you. First, we made the strategic decision to consolidate our global Flexible Circuits manufacturing operations from two plants, one in Columbia, Missouri, the other in Singapore, and to our Singapore plant, to better serve our customers who are primarily in Asia. Second, as I mentioned during our investor meeting last week, we expect to have a handful of real estate sales over the next several quarters, as we actively manage our real-estate portfolio. During the third quarter, we sold our current lab facility located in Swan, Korea, which happen to be located on a very valuable piece of property. And we are currently building a new state-of-the-art customer-oriented R&D facility closer to Seoul, and many of our major [ph] customers for only 40% of what we sold the property for. After addressing for these two items, the earnings for the third quarter were $1.29 per share. Please refer to today's press release for more detailed discussion for these special items. As we discussed in last quarter's earnings call, generally accepted accounting principles prevent us from classifying the divested pharmaceutical business as a discontinued operation. Therefore it raised a year-on-year comparability issue. Q3 2006 revenues for the Pharmaceutical business were $201 million and operating income excluding special items were $73 million or $0.07 per share. Adjusting for Pharma and special items, earnings per share increased 17.3% year-on-year. On slide number six, we compare our third quarter P&L versus last year's third quarter. As you can see on this slide, our results this quarter are very much in line with our overall goals of accelerating top line growth, maintaining our strong operating margin position, while at the same time investing in growth for the future to drive long-term shareholder value. Excluding special items, earnings per share were $1.29, a year-on-year increase of 10.3% on sales growth of 5.5%. Adjusting for divestures, mainly Pharma, earnings increased17.3% on sales growth of 9.4%. Operating income was up 3.3% to $1.4 billion, or up 9.3% excluding divestures. Gross margin and operating income margin were 47.8% and 22.6% respectively, were in line with last year's third quarter after adjusting for the impact of divestures. R&D and related expenditures were up 10% year-over-year excluding divestures to support our overall strategy to reinvigorate our business core. SG&A expense was up 3.8% year-on-year at $1.2 billion, or up over 9% adjusted for divestures, as we stepped up investments in sales and marketing including an increase in advertising and merchandizing, to drive growth in many of our businesses. Our third quarter tax rate was 30.8% and down 1.9 percentage points versus last year. The lower tax rate in the quarter was principally due to a one-time cumulative impact of tax rate changes for several of our European subsidiaries. We now expect our full year tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 32.5%, as a result of this quarter's lower tax rate. Please turn to slide seven for a recap of our third quarter top-line performance. Worldwide sales in local currency increased 6.3%, with 8% from our international operations and 3.6% from the U.S. Organic volume worldwide was 4.2%, led by 7.1% increase in international. Internationally, Europe turned into another very strong quarter led by safety, security and protection, healthcare and consumer-office business with local currency growth of 11.8%, 8.1% of that was organic. Rounding out international, Latin America and Canada and Asia-Pacific regions saw a local currency growth at 11% and 4.1% respectively. Organic volume growth in the U.S. was up slightly, as strong growth in healthcare and electrical communications was offset by weaknesses in a handful of businesses that are impacted by the slowdown in the U.S. housing, low construction and niche retail markets, mainly our industrial minerals, protective materials, traffic-safety and office-supply businesses. Worldwide, acquisitions contribute 2.1% while prices were flat versus last year's third quarter. Divestitures, primarily Pharma, decreased sales by 3.9% and currency translation added 3.1%. Before we move to the business segment highlights, please refer to slide eight. We would like to comment on our year-to-date performance. Excluding divestitures, mainly Pharma, sales were up 10.4% year-to-date with operating income up 12.5% and earnings per share up over 17%. Capital efficiency is equally important to growth and margins. Our return on capital was 22.2%, up 40 basis points from last year's comparable period adjusted for divestitures, mainly Pharma. As you can see, through nine months, we continue to execute as per plan of accelerating growth, maintaining margins and investment returns, while delivering double-digit earnings growth. Overall our plan continues to remain on-track. Now please turn to slide nine, where I will review our quarterly and year-to-date results by business segment starting with industrial and transportation. Driven by broad-based growth across the portfolio, our industrial and transportation business delivered another great quarter, with sales growth of 9.3% and operating income growth of 11.4%. Sales growth was led by our industrial adhesives and tapes business, followed by automotive OEM, automotive body shop solutions and abrasives businesses. Organic local currency sales increased 4.2% with an additional 1.2% of growth coming from acquisitions. Year-to-date, sales were up 8.2% with operating income growth of 10.7%, as our business continues to drive strong productivity programs with operating margins up 50 basis points year-on-year to 21.3%, a record margin for this business. Some of the products driving growth in the third quarter were specialty chemicals for the oil and gas markets; paint preparation systems that deliver productivity and paint booster body shops; Laminating adhesives providing attachment solutions in industrial applications; and packaging tapes, just to name a few. Strong market penetration in the emerging markets, particularly the BRICP countries continued in the third quarter. Europe, Middle East, Africa as well as Latin American regions all showed strong local currency growth. Industrial transportation business continues to invest in R&D, to strengthen its core technologies or adding strategic complementary acquisitions to boost our core adhesives, tapes and the abrasives platforms and to expand into the adjacent markets. We recently announced the acquisition of Venture Tape Corporation, a global provider of pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes based in Rockland [ph], Massachusetts. Venture Tape manufactures a broad range of tapes using construction, oil and gas, HVAC, electronics, aerospace, marine and appliance markets. This acquisition broadens our pressure-sensitive adhesive tape platform, bringing new channels to 3M and allows us to expand into adjacent markets such as the global construction market. Please turn to slide 10 for a review of third quarter results for Display & Graphics segment. For the third quarter, Display & Graphics sales were up 2% or over $1 billion, a record quarter. Sales growth was negatively impacted by over 2%, due to the divesture of the Opticom and Canoga loop business along with product rationalization in a couple of our other businesses. Local currency growth is 1%. Year-to-date Display & Graphics sales have increased more than 4% with profits up nearly 6%. Our market-leading optical systems business continues to focus on market segmentation with strong penetration in handhelds, computer displays and LCD televisions. We did experience attachment rate loss in LCD desktop monitors and LCD TV segments in Q3, as competition continues to intensify in this market. We also noted a slowing in the mix from 720P to 1080P LCD TVs, which impacts our business as 3M films are used more heavily in 1080P sets. As the market leader, we will continue to compete aggressively, dousing product innovations, price and volumes across the entire brightness-enhancement film product pyramid. This means continued price down to meet our customers cost down requirements. Our continued commitment to invest in this business has led to a solid stream of new products that our customers are very excited about that will allow us to continue to maintain our market leadership in brightness-enhancement films. 3M's brightness-enhancement films provide an environment solution to reduce energy consumption, a rapidly increasing requirement from retail customers and government units. We're also on our schedule in scaling up and improving the productivity of our manufacturing facilities. Commercial Graphics posted another solid quarter with strong sales growth. We saw an uplift in the vehicle-wrapping market where we provide films, inks and other products for this rolling billboard industry. Likewise, in traffic safety systems, we have posted continuous seasonal growth internationally, driven largely by the road construction season. The U.S. highway construction market work slowed in third quarter sequentially from the first half of the year, as the industry is facing substantial material inflation for cement and asphalt, which is driving more of the spend in the construction materials for road servicing versus other spend such as sign sheeting. Please turn to slide 11, where we will discuss the third quarter highlights for our healthcare business. Once again, healthcare had a great quarter with broad-based double-digit growth across all divisions, excluding Pharma. Local currency growth, including acquisitions was 16.6%, with 4.6% coming from acquisitions. Of the remaining organic growth, 4.5% resulted from our recent supply agreements related to the sale of our branded Pharmaceutical business, in which our drug delivery systems business became a supplier to the acquiring companies. Of the 4.6% of growth from acquisitions, much of it came from two deals. Biotrace International, PLC, a U.K.-based provider of microbiology products and SoftMed, a Maryland-based provider of health information software solutions. We also acquired Neoplast, a Bangkok-based manufacturer and distributor of consumer and professional skin and room care products. Excluding Pharma, sales in healthcare were up 20.6% over the third quarter of 2006 and profits were up 13.7%, ex-Pharma to $259 million. Year-to-date margins were 27.7%, overall sales were up 22.7% year-to-date and operating income was up 19.1%, both excluding the sale of Pharma. Within the segment, each business delivered double-digit sales growth. Our drug delivery systems business where we leveraged multiple 3M technologies, global regulatory expertise and manufacturing precision led the way. We also saw strong sales in health information systems, where we are the worldwide expert in healthcare funding and performance management solutions. In dentistry, we continued to deliver a steady stream of new products and have been voted the most innovative dental company, two years in running. In fact, we just recently launched a new product in dental, which is new to the world technology that creates a lower shrinking composite filling material available along our two state-of-the-art adhesives for better bonding and patient comfort. In orthodontics, where Self-Ligating Brackets are the fastest growing segment in the market, 3M's exclusive SmartClip braces system is leading the way and we saw impressive double-digit growth in that business again this quarter. Please turn to Slide 12 for details on our consumer and office business. Consumer and office sales increased 5.9% to $898 million in the third quarter. Local currency sales were up 3.5%, including 1.1% from acquisitions, primarily due to the October 2006 acquisition of Nylonge, a global provider of household cleaning products including cellulose sponges. Profits were $192 million, with operating income margins of 21.3%. The consumer and office business is having outstanding year, with year-to-date sales, up almost 8% and operating profits up 12%. Year-to-date growth is being lead by the consumer mass retail and the do-it-yourself retail of channels; strong growth in homecare and from Scotch-Brite scrubbing products. In construction home improvement, growth came from Filtrete, air filtration for the U.S. residential HVAC systems along with command mounting and fastening products in the third quarter. As previously mentioned, sales growth was tampered by a weakness in the protective materials in the office mass retail channel in the U.S. Geographically 3M's international subsides contributed to drive growth again this quarter, with double-digit growth in all regions led by Europe. During the quarter, we stepped up investment in advertising and merchandising to drive growth from the back-to-school season. We'll continue to invest in advertising during the fourth quarter to accelerate growth during the holiday season. Please turn to slide 13, for a recap of our third quarter performance of our safety, security and protection services. Led by growth in respiratory protection, growth in protection and building and commercial services, we delivered sales growth of nearly 11%. Third quarter growth in local currency was 6.7%. Overall segment year-on-year sales growth was held back by almost 2%, due to our industrial minerals business which supplies mineral used on asphalt shingles for the U.S. residential housing market. As you are aware, housing in the U.S. remains very sluggish and our industrial minerals business is really a U.S-centric business. Geographically, sales growth was led by strong double-digit growth in Europe, followed by Latin America and Asia-Pacific. For those of you that attended our investor meeting last week got the opportunity to see the products and technologies of Rockford Thomson Equipment Ltd, a recent acquisition by our security business. Rockford Thomson is a manufacturer of optical character-recognition password readers used by airlines and immigration authorities headquartered in Newbury, U.K. The addition of Rockford Thomson enhances 3M secure document-scanning solutions portfolio and allows expansion in the transportation markets, such as international airlines. Operating income increased almost 11%, as the business continue to maintain consistent operating margins in excess of 20%. Year-to date sales have increased 16.6% with profits up 15.7%. Please turn to slide 14 to review the third quarter results for our final segment, Electrical Communications. The growth results in this business continue to be mixed. However, the financial results continue at record levels. We continue to experience strong growth in electrical markets and communications markets, which have been somewhat offset by declining growth in some of the products we supply in the consumer electronics market, which our end devices that have come to end of life, adversely impacting sales in our Electronic Solutions division. Electronics Markets Materials division started to see some recovery in the third quarter in consumer electronic applications, fueled by demand for fluids. Overall the electrical communications business has taken the necessary corrective actions to respond at the slowing consumer electronics market. As mentioned earlier, the Electronics Solutions division announced a consolidation manufacturing operations and reductions in structure, to allow the businesses strengthen their competitive position. At the same time, our electrical markets and communications businesses delivered a strong double-digit bottom line growth, offsetting the weakness we saw in the consumer electronics piece. Sales were up 7.6%, over the third quarter last year with local currency growth of 4.3%, including 110 basis points of growth from the acquisitions. Strong results continue in Europe and in the U.S. for communication and electrical markets. Outstanding cost discipline continues to generate profits that increased 16.4% over the same period last year, with margins up 1.5 percentage points to 19.6%. Year-to-date sales reflect a strong first half, with an increase of 4.9% and profits increased 13.5%, versus the first nine months of 2006. Please turn to slide 15, where I will review a few balance sheet and cash flow metrics. Excluding tax payments related to the gain and sale for the branded pharmaceutical business, free cash flow in the quarter was $693 million. This year-over-year cash flow drop is more than accounted for by higher tax payments. Third quarter free cash low includes a $200 million U.S. pension contribution, which is the primary driver for lower free cash flow from Q2. Both year-on-year and sequential working capital turns have stabilized at five turns. Capital expenditures totaled $379 million, an increase of $67 million year-on-year and $31 million sequentially. Year-to-date, we have invested greater than $1 billion in capital expenditures, on-track with our full year expectations of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. Dividend payments to our share holders were $343 million and we continue to buyback stock during the quarter, albeit at a slower pace than previous quarters, with gross share repurchases of $557 million. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 729.9 were down 3.5% year-on-year and down slightly sequentially. And finally, our debt-to-cap ratio was 32.3% at the end of the third quarter. This concludes my formal business review. Now, I would like to turn the call back over to George for his closing comments. George?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Thank you very much, Pat. So let's speak now about the rest of the year. To set the scene, the third quarter was characterized by some ups and downs, as there always are. For example, we saw good results in oil and gas, mineral extraction and aerospace. We also saw surprisingly strong results in industrial tapes and adhesives, abrasives and most of our global automotive business. We also saw some late quarter rejuvenation in our electronics business as Pat mentioned. Particularly those selling bonding sealing materials into the electronics industry, as it finally seems to come out of the deep sleep that we've seen most of the year. Our construction and home improvement business also did very well posting 7.5% sales growth as we continue to bring share and launch new products. Our investments in R&D and in acquisitions are clearly paying dividends in all of these areas. On the other side of the equation, it will be no surprise to anyone that we saw continuous softness in the roofing granules business, which continues to drift down slowly in sales. We did not expect to see sales growth improvement in this business anytime soon, even though it's performing relatively well from an earnings standpoint. The growth in optical films for LCD TVs is currently slower at the top of the market where our position is strongest. Consumers are driving the lower reaches of the market fastest right now. And as we mentioned in our investor meeting, we have new products coming in Q4 and Q1 to broaden our offerings, as we invest in advance our leadership position in that market. As a practical matter defending our position here will cost us some price in Q4. But the long-term effect will be to extend our optical franchise which remains a very good business of 3M today and well into the future. While consumer markets did moderately well in the quarter with overall growth of 5.9%, we do see signs that replenishment orders mostly for use in offices are slowing, this is all a U.S-based phenomenon and international markets remained robust as Pat outlined. So for the balance of the year, we expect to see the pattern of absolute growth remaining at level similar to what we've seen in Q3. The business environment in the U.S. market remains the biggest immediate challenge as we go forward. However, we remain committed to our 2X IPI goal and while the rest of our portfolio helped us enormously, I think we all know that it can't fully insulate us from economic effects. However, whatever economic scenario we might encounter in the U.S. going forward, we retain the resolve and the means to fight hard to market share, continued growth and profitability. That's what we will be doing. So with respect to earnings, we expect to finish the full year between $5.54 and $5.62, up from last quarter's expectation of $5.40 to $5.60. These earnings include $0.60 to $0.65 in one-time gains from special items. All in all, despite some end-market challenges, we expect to finish the year 2007 as a wonderful year for 3M; having done a great deal of fixing and rebuilding to accelerate growth, while maintaining our outstanding returns. We completely overcame the impact of sales lost from the sole pharmaceutical business and I think its testimony to resilience of 3M and its people that we seem to have done so with these. So congratulations to all of them. With that, I would like to turn the call over to any questions that you might now have. Thanks a lot everybody. Question And Answer\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question will come from the line Mike Judd with Greenwich Consultants. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Judd: Yes good morning. I have a question on the Display & Graphics area; I am just wondering if you can flush out a little bit more information near the issues around the mix shift from 720P to 1080P and also your comments about pricing and margin... I guess I would infer from that that you are basically lowering your prices as is typical in the electronics area?\nPatrick D. Campbell: Go ahead George.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Yes Mike, thanks for the question. What really started this was the plasma guys were getting a little nervous about their assuming inability to penetrate the market. So they lowered that process first. The LCD guys in the similar sort of display area then followed suit. And of course, it left the 1080 guys here in a position to sit with the process, will follow suit yet further still. So what tended to happen is growth then was spurred in the low end of the marketplace and that's sort of seen the rise of companies like Visio, you might have seen the data where they essentially went from nowhere to number one position in about nine months. So, lot of dynamics going on in this marketplace. But in realty what will happen in longer-term is I think obviously the upper end of the market, Mike, is going to respond and so a big growth right now is occurring in the 720 area of the marketplace. We have few products in that area and in order to unfold our concept of this optical engineering franchise that we have so many other places, we see a need to service that part of the market just as we service the top and so what it will mean is that we will be releasing products in the fourth quarter or the first quarter and the practical realty is that though real products are low in margins but I want to stress we don't see this thing going into any serious trouble. We still think that long-term the optical film business is going to have a margin comparable to or perhaps even higher than the company average. So we're relaxed at doing this. It will cause, I am sure, some turbulence and some concerns here and there, but we are very relaxed with this as we move in the market.\nMichael Judd: Just as a follow-up to that. If you would have think about next year in terms of revenues in that doses and you were kind of running through volume versus price versus mix, how would those numbers sort of, how would that work?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Well, I suspect that you are going to see some continuing pressure. When you mix it all together, what's going to happen, Mike, we are obviously going to see some significant volume pick up in the bottom of the market. But the margins there are less attractive than they are clearly at the top of the market. And the benefit that we get is we have all the capital in the ground, we have the technology. This is nothing new to 3M. It's in our absolute heartland. It's the kind of things that we almost do in our sleep and so we see some nice absorption lift in that bottom end of the market. But there will be a blended drift down, I think in the overall margins of that marketplace. But the key for us is it makes us far more important to customers, it makes us able not just to get the volume gain in the bottom but to secure the top and remain vital in this business to our customers.\nMichael Judd: Thanks for the help.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Deane Dray with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you, good morning.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Good morning Deane.\nDeane Dray: Question just to stay on display if we could; could you quantify for us what the dynamics were in the quarter on the pricing decline and volumes specifically?\nPatrick D. Campbell: Yes, Deane the pricing is very consistent with what our historical trend has been and this is basically been offset by volume. But if you looked at that business, it would basically be flat kind of on a year-on-year basis from a revenue perspective.\nDeane Dray: And how about volume?\nPatrick D. Campbell: Volume would have been basic to offsetting price. So revenue will be about flat in that business on the year-on-year basis.\nDeane Dray: Okay. And then George just to... maybe its premature to quantify what the impact will be as you go down market on this and that was very clear last week at the analyst meeting why you are pursuing this from a strategic franchise standpoint. But when you say that that margin... it may be coming down to the company average or just above the company average, that could be pretty significant and what time frame should this... are you expecting this impact?\nGeorge W. Buckley: I think Deane this is probably a multiyear impact. Obviously, the volumes in these as we released these products, Deane, it takes a little while for adoption to take place so that may take one, two quarters or so. But I think this is a kind of thing that probably will unfold in the next 18 months. Probably will get eased as we get closer to the transition being for the high-def televisions, probably easing at that time would be my guess. But building volume and building market is significant for 3M. So we maintain that enforced in the marketplace and it's a very important marketplace. So I think this is not some precipitous thing that is going to happen next quarter, but I do think it is something we will see transitioning go over the next year and half.\nPatrick D. Campbell: Hey Deane, could I bring it back a little bit to maybe a couple of pieces of my presentation that I had where we were talking about the overall margins of the company. What we are telling you about LCD, LCD is very consistent okay, that we can manage the LCD business within the construct of the overall company margins. We have been anticipating that margins in that business will have to come down and as we showed you that the margins in other piece of business will continue to rise. So on a mix basis at a company level, I would not get excited by it. There's obviously a lot of growth.\nDeane Dray: Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of John Roberts with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Roberts: Good morning.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Good morning John.\nJohn Roberts: Your comments on the consumer electronics industry and the Electro Communications segments, is that cell phone primarily or there are other consumer electronics that are affected there?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Well, the most significant issue we have is an application. Well, I guess couple of things, one is the application in inkjet printers, which I think you are well aware that that business continues to erode and that we had a very large business sector and of course that's just going to, eventually in the light of volumes, coming down significantly. And we did have a few other applications and some cell phone applications that of course have changed the design as well; so, both areas.\nJohn Roberts: Okay and then the cell phone weakness hasn't affected at the optical films business at all?\nGeorge W. Buckley: No, not at all. We are still very strong there.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Begleiter: Hi good morning.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Good morning, Dave.\nDavid Begleiter: George and Pat going back to optical films, ignoring the margin for a second, what is the new strategy implied for operating profit growth over the next two years, as you increase the volume and sales dollars? Do we see a sale where margins are down but operating profit growth is maintained at a fairly high rate?\nPatrick D. Campbell: I will try to tackle that. David, it's a great question. And it was some thing that we are looking at customer by customer, application by application. As George described in his presentation, what we wanted to do is make sure that we maintain the leadership position enhancement films across the entire segment. So, obviously we are trying to go after volume. I won't, at this point in time, not necessarily guarantee you that profitability will actually increase in the near term. But again I want to bring it back to the context of the company as a whole, the broad portfolio we have drives the double-digit growth that we have talked to you in the past about so... been part of our plan and we are going to execute to that. But I would not necessarily see that's in the near-term necessary that we'd see profit increase in that business.\nDavid Begleiter: But just to be clear, could we expect optical films profits to be flat in '08 versus '07?\nPatrick D. Campbell: Too soon to give you that forecast Dave.\nDavid Begleiter: And last thing, any signs of slowing in Europe?\nPatrick D. Campbell: No, not really, our European... I've probably seen the same pieces of data, that a lot of you have seen relative to some macroeconomic indications that... there maybe a crack or two in the system, but we have not seen in our business thus far.\nGeorge W. Buckley: In fact Dave, what we have been seeing in some places where we've been traditionally slow, consumer office where the growth wasn't so good, we have seen advancing growth in those areas. So we seem to be doing something which were offsetting some of the... if there are underlying tendencies along the lines that you're speaking about, we seem to be getting better penetration in some markets that's offsetting that.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Stephen Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question\nStephen Tusa: Hi good morning\nPatrick D. Campbell: Good morning.\nStephen Tusa: Kind of a nitpicky question. What exactly happened in interest in other income? Kind it was like $50 million and that's up pretty substantially year-over-year, but also up from the second quarter?\nPatrick D. Campbell: Well, primarily because our debt levels were up pretty significantly. Obviously borrowing rates are up from last year, I mean that's a simple answer.\nStephen Tusa: I think that's positive though. It's a positive $50 million, it's not an expense\nPatrick D. Campbell: I am sorry; you are telling income or expense or\nStephen Tusa: It's interest in other income. It is a lien item and it's up... it's $53 million versus $13 million last year and --\nPatrick D. Campbell: I sorry, you are telling the income piece of this.\nStephen Tusa: Yes I am sorry for not clarifying.\nPatrick D. Campbell: No I am sorry. I was just thinking of the net. Okay sorry.\nStephen Tusa: Yes no problem.\nPatrick D. Campbell: But our cash balances are up, some of the returns that we're getting, okay are favorable on that side. We obviously try to look at the net impact of the cash and debt side of it. But it's a combination of the two. Our cash balances were up primarily outside the U.S. and some of the returns obviously we get in the marketplace were up than rather than there were the last year.\nMatt Ginter: Steve this is Matt maybe we could follow-up after, if there is any confusion. But quarterly interest expense was 53 versus 37 last year.\nStephen Tusa: Okay.\nMatt Ginter: So it is up, that's up and interest expense was higher than last year as well, as cash balances are up.\nStephen Tusa: The other question is George or maybe Pat, could you just maybe give us when you look at here other than Display & Graphics, what worries you the most, what are kind of the key variables and '08 would be great, but if you don't want to get into '08, yet maybe what are the key variables for '07... for the rest of '07 for the fourth quarter to hit your guidance, but what you are going to be watching over the fourth quarter outside of Display & Graphics?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Well I think it's much of what we said already Steve. In the consumer and office business, it's tighter in the U.S. there is no question about. They did well, the numbers show that they did well, offset by great growth internationally. So I think their numbers will grow side ways they will do just fine in the... the thing that we saw the last year Steve was in the industrial markets, in particular distribution, we saw a lot of slowdown toward the end of December and so we got to make sure we watch that and we are working very, very hard to make sure in the early parts of the quarter here that we don't get caught by that surprise at the end of the quarter. So that's an issue, because when you are feeding into distributors, clearly they have a lot more choice on whether to take or not to take. So that's something that we just want to make sure that we don't get trapped by as we did last year. And then it's some of the old faithful, it's probably the roofing granules business. But I mean I don't expect any big change in that from the third quarter. So its, Steve it's maybe consumer watch the industrial thing which and if you saw the industrial growth rates they were great, but just going to make sure that we continue those right through the quarter. We don't get tripped at the end as people sort go off vacation and that's probably most of it.\nStephen Tusa: Okay and then one quick one. We look at all the capacity that's coming on line in the third and the fourth quarter list, that's starting up here. What gives you the confidence that the roofing granules remains pretty weak and you guys kind of add capacity there into the teeth of the downturn, I mean what gave you confidence that you are actually building the demand here and how concerned should we be with regards to that as we look forward in '08 given that you are spending so much in the next the third and the fourth quarter to get these plants up in running?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Well you had a couple of questions in there. In the roofing granules business Steve, we took out one plant in the Northeast, which eases some of the overcapacity and by the way we were supplying markets well in to the South from that plant that really sort of reversing in cost in that business last year. So that's gone away. In the overall housing market, I don't know there is any of this out here would withhold a lot of optimism in the immediate future for the housing. On the other hand you have seen what's happening now in our consumer and home improvement business. We are through penetration, through winning new accounts, through in some cases knocking out competition, getting penetration there and through new products like Filtrete in command, we continue to do that. It seems to be working okay for now Steve. So I am not negative on that business, but it will require the same execution, the same old 3M formula, lot of innovations, lot of new products into the channel to make sure that we remain stable in that business.\nStephen Tusa: Okay and I guess in regard to the other capacity of all the capacities coming online whatever AR [ph] plans that your adding in the next two quarters, how comfortable are you that you are not adding this into this global slowdown that many are anticipating?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Well first of all, the vast majority of the capacity speed is coming on screen overseas and the plants are raised in such a way that you build the box, you only put enough production machinery into those plants that are appropriate to current levels of demand and then you obviously add to them as demand increases. So you don't necessarily carry all of the burden of the sort of an unfilled plant. But as a fact a matter Steve, the reality is when you have a plan that takes two years and you have a market that changes in six months, you have no choice but to sometimes build ahead and try to plan in a scalable manner as you add capacity and even if there are temporary dips in the U.S. market or even some parts of the international market, the reality is those will last six months maybe and we will be in a position to respond to the growth, as the money comes back and it will. So it's impossible Steve to time the opening of a plant and the exact addition of the capacity to follow economic circumstances. Just not... none of us have those kind of levers and that kind of refinement of finesse to be able to do that. So you do consume some of that.\nPatrick D. Campbell: Yes, Steve let me just add, those... especially, internationally; the plants are being stalled in, recall China, India, Poland, Russia with all have very significant yield. The developing part of the economy is just absolutely booming. So, most of the capacity internationally is going into the highest growth parts of the economy and still to-date.\nStephen Tusa: Right. Okay, thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of John Inch with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Inch: Thank you. Good morning.\nPatrick D. Campbell: Good morning John.\nJohn Inch: Hello guys. Sort of interesting Pat, you hit your five year tax rate target this quarter. Anyway my question Pat actually is on, how much did raw materials, particularly given the price of energy drag this quarter and if not this quarter given the price, the rise of price of oil or does that going to be a headwind and perhaps a little color around that. And then the second thing would be just currency up 3.1% top line, what was the translation impact to earnings per share?\nPatrick D. Campbell: Yes John, on the material side. I think George had kind of mentioned commodity in your number of about $35 million impact in the quarter. That's kind of the headwind piece. I am sorry, what.\nJohn Inch: I'm just saying, does that get worst just based somewhat has been happening --?\nPatrick D. Campbell: Alright, I don't... who's knows again whether this is going to play out. But importantly, we have got a very, very active purchasing group that continues to... we see those commodity headwinds. In some cases you have got absorbed those and they got to go... you'll find other ways of getting offset. So, they are very much on-track of trying to manage our net material costs on a on a cost down basis, you can guarantee that we don't let him off the hook, okay in a tough commodity world or not. So, but it is a fact of business and I think what is great is even with... if you go back and look commodity prices over the last five years, I mean a lot of these things have doubled, tripled what they had been and yet our margins have continued to grow. So I think it shows the overall strength of the company. On your foreign exchange question, we have probably a nickel or so benefit here in the quarter relative to exchange.\nJohn Inch: And then just on consumer and office. Consumer and office, George was sort of a nice profit surprise given sort of what had been happening in the office retail channel of the U.S. Based on that outlook though is that business going to start to drag may be a little color around, I know you said it could hold together but I am just wondering more profitability of it, particularly given sort of what you see... what you saw with respect to back-to-school season and to sort of what the trend is there?\nGeorge W. Buckley: I think, John the mix of the business is going to change, I see no reason to believe that until the U.S. economy shows a little bit more robust trends that we will see much difference in the way that the U.S. consumer and office business unfolds and if you can't separate that into two pieces John, the office piece seems to be the weaker. Consumer home improvement which is in that segment, John you saw and the numbers did very, very well. Now the positive news as I said earlier was we seemed to be getting a real traction in consumer and office overseas. So net-net, I suspect that the performance in the fourth quarter is going to be similar to that that we saw in the third quarter. Of course we all know John, I think is you and I talked about it personally, what we really need is to continue to drive innovation but at the same time hoping and anticipating that we will see some turnaround sometime next year in the underlying end-markets for housing. But your guess is as good as mine on whether that happens in one quarter or later quarter. But all in all, John I am not especially worried about some terrible worsening of the consumer market. We seem to have been fairly adaptable in international markets and innovation that continue to drive that business and you are right to observe who have been doing quite well relative to some of the penetration of our consumers, of our immediate customers.\nPatrick D. Campbell: Hey John your kind of question on margins. We will be a little cautious. The third quarter in that business is usually the peak\nJohn Inch: Right.\nPatrick D. Campbell: So the volume peak as the margin peak. So just don't try to extrapolate that out for... in to the future, it is kind of a peak period.\nJohn Inch: Yes, now I understand. Thanks very much.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Thanks John.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Spraque with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Spraque: Thank you. Good morning everyone?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Hi Jeff.\nJeff Spraque: Just back to D&G for a question and then kind of a general question may be on margins overall. But when you think about kind of this pressed into the low end, kind of defend your turf and drive the growth. Do you have share today with these emerging new low end OEMs like the Visios and some of these other players or is that kind of a virgin territory that you need to try to conquer?\nPatrick D. Campbell: Jeff yes we do. We do have penetration really in most of the applications as just to say a space of the price cost sensitivity at the low end of the market is more severe. So something that we just have to battle day in and day out and as George outlined last week, we are going to compete in all aspects of that market.\nJeff Spraque: And I am just wondering if you not only think about margins overall, in fact, the model you laid last week is kind of understandable, kind of recycling the operating leverage etcetera back into the business; but specifically I am just wondering which businesses do you think have the most margin upside from here, if you are in fact going to look at 500... 600 basis points of margins down in Display & Graphics over the next 18 months or so?\nPatrick D. Campbell: Jeff, obviously this is an ongoing management... what the opportunity is, where we want it and invest and so forth, but I think it's fair to say that really across the company we have opportunities. One thing I laid out for you is, we still have opportunity as we leverage our growth rate into our fixed cost structure which really affects all businesses. So there's opportunity across all of them, but George and I have to really place bets on you, where we want to invest and so forth. And we do manage the company in total. So if optical needs a little bit of support because their margins are eroding, obviously, we have got to find offsets, and we continue to drive productivity across the organization. So generally speaking I would see we really have opportunities in all business. So it's a matter of... if you took that model I talked about, we have actually won that model featuring one of our businesses as well, we decide how much you want to plough back into margin versus growth, is something that we just actively manage; but I would say that underlying all of our businesses have growth potential there.\nJeff Spraque: And I just wonder if you could give us a little sense to how you think about cash flow going forward; still some pressure obviously little bit on the working capital terms, accounts receivables were up on kind of softer sales. Is this still... I guess first that you can comment on receivables given sales growth is a little bit slow and then I guess the question of inventory turns kind of goes more to the supply chain issues but what we might expect going forward?\nPatrick D. Campbell: Jeff to me one of the good sides of the quarter when I look at working capital, total looks like we have stabilized the situation. So as I look on a going forward basis, we should basically be able to improve our performance as we continue to get our supply chain kind of square to round. On the receivable side the thing we have to be very careful of is you have to kind of see where the sales occurred during the quarter. They accrued more that towards the back end of the quarter. You end up with obviously more receivables on your books at the end of quarter than you do... if you look at more on an average on average basis. We have some receivable follow-up issues that we have to keep... you keep looking on. As our international piece of business continues to grow faster than the U.S. that actually hurts our mix a little bit because their turns are lower than what they are in the U.S. So we are very much focused on that. But if you look at it from a forward-looking cash flow projection, I think our working capital turns now. I feel pretty good we have stabilized the situation and that should now provide leakage on a going forward basis.\nJeff Spraque: Okay, thank you.\nMatt Ginter: Thanks Jeff.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of 31-34\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Shannon O'Callahan with Lehman Brothers. Please proceed with your question.\nShannon O'Callahan: Good morning guys.\nPatrick D. Campbell: Good morning, Shannon [ph].\nShannon O'Callahan: Sorry to keep you on optical here, I am sure you are sick of hearing about but, I just want clarification; on when you talked about... you still think its, a business that can have company average margins are better, it sounds like there was an optical comment not for the whole segment. I mean, would that imply that the whole segment you would see is lower than the company average?\nPatrick D. Campbell: No, we were not trying to imply that at all.\nShannon O'Callahan: Okay. So, I mean if all D&G, you were at the company average obviously, optical, you still think can better than that?\nPatrick D. Campbell: I think that D&G are the mix basis will not drift too far away from what the company average will be longer term.\nShannon O'Callahan: Okay and then I guess just, if I could understand the growth there. You took down the growth target for D&G when we were in St. Paul and if you are going to have market, shouldn't the volume accelerate, I guess the price pressure obviously, is much more. But, I mean, can you give a sense of... when you are adjusting whole segment there, is that really driven by optical in terms of the downward revision?\nPatrick D. Campbell: Yes, I would say the...at least in my thought process is that entire revision is really related to optical and I will say it's probably more so of two aspects, one is the mix of the business is with our volume expectations, we haven't changed all that much relative to TV projections from end-market perspective and then, probably our assumption relative to the prices is more aggressive than we previously had.\nGeorge W. Buckley: I think Shannon, we expect a million questions, but obviously there's a lot of dynamics in this market place. What is likely going to happen I think in the near term is we will see at not just in the lower segment, but even in the higher segments, there'll be continued margin pressures, continued pricing pressure. But the challenge for the company is to kick into absolute high gear all its activities are double write, double speed, yield improvements, as a means of offsetting that kind of pricing pressure. Now will we... what we net-net be able to offset all of that, I suspect there'll still be some net negatives that come of it. But the beauty is that as this sort of this battle unfolds and we fought this battle and seen this battle many times in our history. It's likely to go on for the next year and a half and then there is relief at hand, which is in the change to the high-def televisions which would probably ease some of the pricing pressure and will probably move the market back up a little bit, it would be my guess towards the 1080P. So we will benefit again from that, but as this... and then maybe stability perhaps, obviously more capacity coming on-stream as demand increases. But probably relative price stability for some time and then this market by that time will have captured 60% to 70% of the TV volume in the world, which means it will then probably ease in and evolve into a much, much more stable market for the future. That would be the way that I would read the kind of the ups and downs of this market over the next 4-5 years. Matt do you have any opinion?\nMatt Ginter: No.\nGeorge W. Buckley: So long term we are genuinely very positive about this market. It doesn't mean in the short run we won't have some hand-to-hand combat we always do and especially a tougher economic times, where people are very sensitive to price. But all-in-all it seems like a great market and we have the capacity, we have the technology, we have the will, we have the customer contacts to be able to make this the kind of great business that you have in many other segments of our company.\nShannon O'Callahan: And just last one from me, thanks for that. Just getting from sort of the, in the growth rate you saw, this quarter you mentioned not everything went right, but I terms of getting sort of, it backing to that 5% to 8% percent range and maybe towards the higher end when we will. What are you are really looking at to drive that acceleration.\nGeorge W. Buckley: It was much of the same stuff that we have been doing before. It's getting out, plants sold very close to what to new customer demand and getting filled rates up, that will lift part of what we are doing. The new product machine seems to be in top gear right now. We are spending a lot more money on R&D. The new product vitality index is going up, so this stuff is speeding into the market place and in the end it is product which is a solution to the problems. In particular, if you just take a look at a segment that we have talked about quite a lot today, the consumer and home improvement segment, which is really, was originally kind of a paint and dry wall business. As we added to the portfolio in that business with filter products, with more adhesive products, it took the edge of some of the pressure off that we might have seen in the traditional core, and we will continue to do that. So it's the plain and simple answer that innovation remains the key.\nShannon O'Callahan: Okay, so sort of the broad strategy, particular segment that's going to do it, it's going to be served across the board based on what you have put in place?\nGeorge W. Buckley: This is happening all... right across the company. We are not pointing to anybody.\nShannon O'Callahan: But there wasn't anything in this quarter which particularly you saw that we expect to be the one sort of... one that kicks up, just sort of the broad strategy coming into effect?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Yes. It was as we said there was just continuation of the roofing granule stuff that we've seen now for, for a year and you know the shift within the optical business and a little bit of the U.S- based consumer, they were the things that were dragged, so many of the positive things came through. It was interesting that the words that we used on the growth, a company of our size having 9.4% growth in the quarter is pretty spiffy nevertheless, no matter what we say.\nShannon O'Callahan: Okay. Thanks a lot guys.\nMatt Ginter: Thanks.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Okay well thank you very much ... Go ahead.\nOperator: That concludes the question to the answer portion of our conference at this time we will turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Well thank you everybody for joining us this morning, I'd just like to reiterate that while there's lot to do yet, our plan is on-track and we are confident in our ability to execute it. So thank you very much for listening. We much appreciate it. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today.

This conference is being recorded today, February 24, 2009 at the request of Ceradyne. All participants are currently in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. We request that participants limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to allow others to call the opportunity to participate. Hosting the call today is Joel Moskowitz, Ceradyne\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; who is accompanied by David Reed, President of North American operations; Jerry Pellizzon, Chief Financial Officer and Marc King, Vice President of Armor Operations. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Moskowitz, the company has requested that I read the following statement.  The matters discussed in this conference call may include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future performance of Ceradyne that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in the company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Moskowitz. Please go ahead sir.\nJoel P. Moskowitz: Thank you, Kristy. And in addition to the Safe Harbor statement, I would like to remind everyone that this is being taped and you can get a copy of it should you desire. We are very pleased to have you on the conference call today, which is to report the fourth quarter 2008 and the total year 2008 financial results. What we will do is what we have been doing as a matter of record is I will review briefly the press release that was issued prior to the open this morning. And then I will turn it over to Jerry Pellizzon for a few comments on our financial performance and the balance sheet. And then we will open it to questions and answers. This morning we announced that the sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $138.9 million that compared to $191.4 million a year ago in 2007. Net income decreased also in the fourth quarter of 2008 they decreased by about $13.9 million or 39.7% to $21.3 million or $0.81 per fully diluted shares that compared to last year of $35.2 million or a $1.28 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2007. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 included a pre-tax charge of $2.3 million from and other than temporary reductions in the value of our investments in auction rate securities. This charge had a negative impact on net income of approximately $0.06 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of \u201908. Our gross margin was 37.1% of net sales in the fourth quarter of '08 and that compared to 39.6% in the same period of '07. The provision for income tax is however was 30.3% in Q4 '08, compared to 33.7% in the same period last year. Our sales for the 12 months ending December 31, 2008 were $680.2 million that compared to $756.8 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2007. And net income for the 12 months ended December 31, 2008 was $106.8 million, or $4 per fully diluted share on 26.7 million shares that was down from a $144.3 million, or $5.20 per fully diluted share last year on 27.7 million shares. Net income for the 12 months ended December 31, 2008 included a pre-tax acquisition related compensation charge of $9.8 million that was associated with a pre-closing commitment by SemEquip Incorporated, which we acquired in August 2008, to pay incentive compensation to certain employees and advisors, and a pre-tax charge of $5.9 million from an other-than-temporary reduction in the value of our investments in auction rate securities. These charges had a combined negative effect on net income for the total year ending December 31, 2008 of $0.38. New bookings for the fourth quarter in 2008 were $90.2 million and that compared to $258 million in the same period last year. For the 12 months ending December 31, '08 new bookings were $566.8 million that compared to $651.3 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2007. Our backlog at the end of last year was at $126.4 million that compared to a year ago December 31, 2007 of $238.9 million.  I went onto comment on the press release that frankly we were very pleased as we look at the significant global economic downturn, that our company was able to meet its revised 2008 earnings share guidance with full-year '08 financial results of $4 per fully diluted share on sales of $680 million. Perhaps as important as our income statement in this economic environment is our strong year-end balance sheet. With cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $221.4 million with over $8 per share in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, and a book value over $23 per share, we are very comfortable in our ability to continue to invest in our future, take advantage of acquisitions, which we perceived as targets of opportunity and maintain our strong liquidity position in an uncertain global economy. I went onto say because of the interest and our dependence on body armor that although as of today, we have not received the XSAPI production armor order, we have received the draft of the amended production request for quotation, and believe the orders will be released later in Q1 or early Q2 2009. Those related XSAPI sets are expected to be delivered in full in calendar 2009. However, Ceradyne is concerned about the delays in armor orders, as well as what we view as uncertainty in our industrial markets particularly our European markets headed by ESK Ceramics in Kempten, Germany. Therefore, because the situation is unclear, we believe it is advisable to revise the 2009 guidance we provided in December of '08 of $2.30 per fully diluted share on sales of approximately $600 million. We now feel that our guidance forward would create a range of sales of $465 million to $500 million with earnings of a $1.60 to $2 per fully diluted shares. Because of our outlook particularly for the solar industry, I pointed out that we have recently committed to the acquisition of an additional 13.7 acres in Tianjin, China, on which we plan to build a production plant of approximately 200,000 square feet for the production of our ceramic crucibles used in the manufacturing of polysilicon photovoltaic solar cells. We anticipate that we will spend about $22 million on this state-of-the-art factory, which will include our proprietary pre-coating technology. Although, we expect a modest increase in solar demand early in 2009, we believe the combination of lower cost silicon, worldwide demand for clean alternative energy, and U.S. and other countries subsidies and stimulus investments will result in an improving 2009 picture and robust 2010 demand. Our newest factory will be located near our current Tianjin factory and is expected to be up and running later this year. I concluded saying that we are aware of the uncertainties, the current global economy is presenting. In the short run, we intend to bring our costs and headcount into line with actual sales. However, we will continue to invest in the future while preserving our strong cash and liquidity position. You will have to excuse me, I have a very bad cold, I thought I was doing pretty well till the end.  Jerry would you like to review some of financial numbers.\nJerrold J. Pellizzon: Sure Joel. Good morning to everybody in the call. The trend that, the revenue diversification trend that started in Q3 '07 continued we saw a decline of body armor while we picked up, in our non-defense business. Body armor, overall sales for the year ended up at 680 nearly and a decline of about $76 million, most of that decline was in the ceramic body armor. We did see a growth of our non-industrial based or I am sorry, our non-defense base to $261 million of sale in 2008 versus $197 million in 2007 for a growth rate of 32.7%. So, we've been moving our concentration over to non-defense and we continued that trend and that trend will continue we believe in 2009. We did get contributions from our acquisitions in '08, the difference there, the additive sales were $26 million, a pickup in '08 versus '07 for those acquisitions that we made in '07. Of course '07 there were partial years for Boron and partial years for Minco. We continue to see growth in our ceramic crucible business that was another area of growth during the year. Durable itself grew by $44 million in the year to $75 million overall, 16 of that was from, including Minco but about 25 of that alone was from a growth of ceramic crucibles. Boron products had growth of $10 million and that again because it was partial year in '07, but that trend continues. The key for us in this economy is free cash flow and we are going to continue to produce that in '09, we can go over that as the questions develop, but I think that's important we've got a very, very stable balance sheet. We are continuing to liquify it via programs to reduce our inventories commensurate with the reduction in the guidance that we have given for revenues. So, I think the trends continue, we are generating as I said the free cash flows is important to our balance sheet and we are looking forward to another good year in '09. Joel?\nJoel P. Moskowitz: Thanks Jerry. Kristy, I think the most effective way to use our time is to go right into the Q&A. And that will bring out some of the questions I believe the callers have.\nOperator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Michael Lu of ThinkEquity.\nMichael Lu \u2013 ThinkEquity Partners LLC: Thank you for taking my questions here, Jerry you would, excuse me, like you all, I am also bad on the cold here. Jerry, you mentioned producing free cash flow in 2009 could you elaborate a bit more on that and what is the target level for the year?\nJerrold J. Pellizzon: We have the CapEx for the year is dominated by our expansion into China, we looked at an overall plan of [$45 million] of CapEx and about half of that is dedicated just to expanding to a new facility in China. So, we are expanding our capacity there to produce ceramic crucibles. So, we got $45 million of depreciation forecasted and our depreciation and amortization is 36 for the year. So, we got about a $10 million difference between the two and if you take the $1.65 or the $2 per share you've got free cash flow between $32 million and $42 million for the year. So, that's the free cash flow, now that's without the impact of any working capital and we do think that we are going to see reductions in inventory and receivable balances commensurate with the a slightly contracted business activity and business level.\nMichael Lu \u2013 ThinkEquity Partners LLC: All right, great and also I want to switch gears thereof, you've talked about the delays in the defense orders, but assuming the current economic environment holds and the current year outlook holds.\nJoel P. Moskowitz: Yeah.\nMichael Lu \u2013 ThinkEquity Partners LLC: Do you see a cross over by year-end, where non-defense drives 50% of revenues?\nJoel P. Moskowitz: It's a possibility, the reason that we used the [verbiance] we did in the XSAPI, the revised RFQ say that they want the product, the XSAPI all in eight months. So, even if it gets delayed a little further say into April, we will be able to put all of that out in 2009. So, I would say that right now, our projections of about a 50:50 mix for '09 most likely will stand up.\nMichael Lu \u2013 ThinkEquity Partners LLC: Okay. Next I have one last question and I will hop back in queue, it seems like obviously there I the increased use of nuclear energy and there is a lot of increased discussed and, pickup in momentum, could you talk about the waste containment in Boron business, has there been a pickup in demand or increase recently given the more frequent discussions on nuclear energy use?\nDavid P. Reed: Yeah. This is Dave Reed. Let me answer that Michael. We have continued on all of the programs on the nuclear out of our Canadian operations those are very long term plans as, and we are starting to see much more of an increase in the level of interest in the nuclear plants going forward. So, both in the U.S. and in the international scene, we see that there is a commitment to those plans and we're starting to bid on some of that longer-term business. The short-term is not that large of a market, it's starting to develop so I think we're in for about the level we had talked about recently and we see an increase in that business probably starting in about three years out, where we are going to really get much more traction out of our Canadian plant and also out of some of the chemicals that come out of Boron.\nMichael Lu \u2013 ThinkEquity Partners LLC:  Okay, thank you.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Morgan.\nAl Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Morgan: Hi.\nDavid P. Reed:  Hi Al.\nAl Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Morgan:  David I wanted to maybe just for yourself and Joel. As you look at the XSAPI and the comments that you hope 2009 you can do all of the production or all of the deliveries that could be forthcoming. How do you balance the cost side of the equation what your anticipation here in the guidance that you gave, do we need a certain volume, a 120,000 sets and you're, for a share of that, how do you balance the forthcoming supply or the order and the current cost structure, which certainly sounds like maybe you're in the midst of evaluating how to reduce that a little bit. So, I am struggling a little bit with the delays you're very hopeful that you can get the share you had in years passed, but to talk a little bit about the balance between supply and your cost.\nDavid P. Reed: Sure, Al. As Joel said we did receive a draft request for proposal and we responded to that last week that draft implies that the number one criteria for award is first going to be sustained in the industrial base and then probably the second would be pricing. Now, we feel that we are in very good position to maintain our large share and, your question about the cost structure all the numbers that Jerry has given you are based on that reduced level of participation on the XSAPI program. So, we have downscaled our operations. Last year we made significant reductions in our employees on the body armor side of the business both in the March-April time period, when the stretch out began and again in the fall, we have further plans to reduce that slightly at the beginning of the second quarter. Right now we have a fairly good level of business, we are making some foreign military sales of the XSAPI old style insert design. So, I think we are in very good shape, we have a well-run machine in both the hot press and the assembly area, Al and the cost are well under control. As Jerry said, one of the goals there we will try to reduce some of the inventory we have in our graphite tooling and in some the backing material that we have and that will be commensurate with the lower level of business going forward. So, that our gross margin should still hold up pretty well.\nJoel P. Moskowitz: Al, let me just add that to clear off any confusion I mean in the numbers we focus a lot obviously on XSAPI, but we do have a, a less of the business of armor also in our numbers, XSAPI represents about 38% of total body armor numbers. So, when you go into cost structure, we've got other programs that cover our fixed expenses. So, I think that's a help also.\nAl Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Morgan: Good point. The other part of follow-up as well as, is on the mix of business of the transition, is the 50:50 sort of a stated targeted or for '09 and if so is that a function of defense or ACO falling down a little bit because of the reduced volumes, in another words if ESK is struggling a little bit on the European side because of the global economy situation what's going to help either lift the non-defense business to get it to 50:50 or is it really just the defense is falling down that much more?\nJoel P. Moskowitz: Well right now regarding our strategy we've said for several, when we talked about longer rating strategy that we anticipated and we are shooting for a company that was approximately 50:50 defense and non-defense. And as things had evolved with the market, one even with these numbers we see the market for armor reduced to its current level and of course that just reduced it in getting closer to the 50:50 and then as you just add the ESK is going to have a weak year in '09, and so that kind of brings both into line with the revised guidance that we gave. Regarding your question of the non-defense area, the area that I believe as of this minute is about as exciting as it's ever been with some of the negative press is the solar energy, a scenario that we have what we believe is a proprietary product, which is the purity of the fused silica remember we bought the company that made the raw materials Minco in Tennessee about two years ago that's been a terrific acquisition. So, we have the capacity we have the purity and now based on the German R&D efforts the real example of working together and integration they are the ones who developed this coating, so that when the melt the silicon to make the photovoltaic solar cells, the silicon adjust for that crucible as clean as the [LPAS] and that's so terribly important we also have reports recently as this week, which maybe displayed in Munich in solar convention in a few weeks that the use of our crucibles actually enhances the efficiency, which is a big deal because it doesn't cost the manufacturer any more money and they get a better product. So, how material is this, the next question I think we will have about 70 million or so in shipments of solar crucibles this year, which is up significant (Audio Disturbance). And you may have seen it out, there was a report from a research firm recently that they specifically said our type of crucibles they were projecting I think by 2013 or 2015, a market of $1.1 billion, if we maintain our market share that that product alone will be hundreds of million of dollars at good profit margins. So, that's a potential breakdown, the other one that I haven't mentioned today because its still in the very earlier stages is the use of our titanium diboride for the replacement of carbon in the wire pulled the [holder old] cells versus smelting aluminum that is very encouraging to us I think there will be some delays because the aluminium industry is struggling widely now because of the worldwide decline in commodities, but we are getting very good technical results, and we are getting orders. So, that is one of the program it's the only program that I think eventually could be a $1 billion for Ceradyne.\nAl Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Morgan:  Thanks a lot. I'll hop back in queue.\nJoel P. Moskowitz:  Okay.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Liebowitz of Wachovia Securities.\nGary Liebowitz \u2013 Wachovia Securities: Good morning gentlemen.\nJoel P. Moskowitz: Hi Gary.\nGary Liebowitz \u2013 Wachovia Securities: Jerry can you mentioned XSAPI would be 38% of body armor sales in '09 and Joel just mentioned the solar markets, can you just go over the other large chunks of the business namely the side plates and ESK expectations in terms revenue?\nJerrold J. Pellizzon: Well, ESK we most recently took down pre-elimination, we have it at about a $110 million post we have it at about $87 million. Our total Thermo business should be about $85 million, Boron should come in about $22 million, OPD is going to stay pretty consistent with where it is, and our commercial sector is probably flat right now. Those were the major items that we are seeing.\nGary Liebowitz \u2013 Wachovia Securities: Okay. And what about the side plates' expectations did that make up the bulk of the balance of the body armor sales?\nJerrold J. Pellizzon: Well that's really the difference between the somewhat the difference between the high end and low end of guidance.\nGary Liebowitz \u2013 Wachovia Securities: So, okay, I understand. And then also another follow-up question on XSAPI, Joe you mentioned that you were specifically concerned about the delays in that contract if the GAO does sustain the protest that its currently reviewing what is that due to the timeline?\nJerrold J. Pellizzon: Let me answer that Gary. So far the GAO has not put any stop work based on that protest and we believe that protest is so kind of out of left wheel that they will not they have had a chance to look at that for almost two weeks now and have not. So, we don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to occur, we suspect that the request for quote will come out the former one very soon, and we feel that we are in very good position, as you know we passed all of our first article testing, and recently we have passed with flying colors all of our lock testing on that first delivery order that we had with the government. So, we feel that we are in very good position to respond to that request for quote.\nGary Liebowitz \u2013 Wachovia Securities: I understand but do you think the, the Inspector Generals report that came out in January supports some of the assertions that the, this protesting is putting forth? David P. Reed Not at all Gary because the protest talks about a period that was just incurred and all of that testing was done at a government certified laboratory that has a phenomenal set of equipment on-site unlike anywhere I have ever seen and the Inspector General report talked about testing that was done two and three years ago so the two don\u2019t match at all and that's really why there has been no stop work as far as I can see.\nGary Liebowitz \u2013 Wachovia Securities: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Quillin of Stephens Incorporated.\nTimothy Quillin \u2013 Stephens Inc.: Good morning.\nJoel P. Moskowitz: Good morning, Tim.\nTimothy Quillin \u2013 Stephens Inc.: You've given us a lot of numbers and I can probably go thorough the transcripts and piece this together, but I am just trying to figure out exactly about how you are thinking about body armor in the guidance presumably, if defense is roughly half of revenue then maybe body armor is a little bit lower than that I mean are you thinking body armor comes in about 200 million in revenue?\nJoel P. Moskowitz: Well remember we've given a pretty wide spread there, and its between 230 and 260.\nTimothy Quillin \u2013 Stephens Inc.: 230 and 260 and the delta between 230 and 260 is primarily side plates and\u2026\nJerrold J. Pellizzon:  Let's say that the body armor more is inline of 200 to possibly the 230 out that number I think Joel included vehicle and flat armor so to just to keep it clear U.S. body armor and that's I think where the confusion is so we are talking about body armor.\nTimothy Quillin \u2013 Stephens Inc.:  Okay so body armor is 200 and 230?\nJerrold J. Pellizzon:  Right.\nTimothy Quillin \u2013 Stephens Inc.:  Okay. And the delta between 200 and 230 is side plates?\nJerrold J. Pellizzon:  Pretty much.\nTimothy Quillin \u2013 Stephens Inc.: So, is the higher number presumed that there is an X version of side plates and where are we in that process?\nJerrold J. Pellizzon:  Well we're working with the government they're working on their specs for that plate as the prior question brought to everybody's attention the government has been very preoccupied with the Inspector General reports and having to testify and defend themselves against that so some of these other programs have gone a little slower than we had anticipated, but it seems like that fear is over now and that they getting back to really doing every day task. So, we expect to see something late this quarter early next quarter.\nTimothy Quillin \u2013 Stephens Inc.:  Okay fair. And then just last question with regards to XSAPI so I understand that this initial order will be delivered all in 2009, and then what's next for 2010. Do you have to get the weight lower before you get additional orders or how are you thinking about 2010 at this point? Thank you.\nJerrold J. Pellizzon:  Yeah. We're probably thinking in 2010 that the weight probably has to be lower as everyone's heard there has been real concern with total weight that (Audio Disturbance) occurring. I think most people are familiar they took about 3 pounds out of, improved out of factory [consensus] the increase in weight is about a little under two pounds for the XSAPI suite of chest protectors and side protectors. So, it still be a net lessening of weight, but they don't really want to take on any more weight after getting rid of sound. So, we think that's the challenging for going forward is to take some more weight out of that system and that's where the bulk of our R&D money will be spent in body armor this year.\nTimothy Quillin \u2013 Stephens Inc.: Okay. And how achievable is that?\nDavid P. Reed: Well it\u2019s a difficult task, but we have been working on it for the past year and half and we are encouraged that we will be able to move in that direction.\nTimothy Quillin \u2013 Stephens Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josephine Millward.\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Stanford Group Company: Good morning.\nJoel P. Moskowitz: Good morning, Josephine.\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Stanford Group Company: Good morning, Joel. I just have a follow-up question on XSAPI, if you receive the XSAPI awarding in late Q1 or early Q2, will you be able to start delivery in April?\nDavid P. Reed: Yes. Absolutely, as I said earlier we have already built a 1000 sets of that very successfully had no issues in manufacturing. We actually have an inventory of ceramic plates ready to go and we have been running at low rate production right now to keep that process tuned up for us. So, don't see any problem, have all the raw material in place to go and as soon as we get the order we are going straight ahead.\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Stanford Group Company: That's great. And in your guidance, what type of market share are you assuming in the first 120,000 sets of XSAPI? \nDavid P. Reed: Well we are hopeful that we will maintain at least what we had in the past, there is an opportunity to do a little may be based on industrial based sustainment level that you are talking about. So, we are hopeful that we will be somewhere in that 60% to 70% range.\nJerrold J. Pellizzon: And Josephine since you asked the question about, when we could start body armor, I think its appropriate to point out that the first quarter of 2009 as part of our earnings goal, we would only estimate that we are going to come in at the $0.25 to $0.30 and then we will make up the rest of if we get to our guidance with the balance of three quarters. So, first quarter probably $0.25 to $0.30 is a respectable guidance number at this point.\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Stanford Group Company: That's very helpful thank you.\nJerrold J. Pellizzon: You're welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael French of Morgan Joseph.\nMichael French \u2013 Morgan Joseph & Co.: Good morning gentlemen.\nJerrold J. Pellizzon: Good morning.\nMichael French \u2013 Morgan Joseph & Co.: Another follow-up there on XSAPI, getting any better sense from the customer, what they're thinking longer term since, whether they would go peer fully like they did in previous versions or whether, they will think their latency in try to get some thing lighter and then maybe do it peer fully or and then the second part is it, there is a delta here or a drop off with body armor here in the U.S., you mentioned foreign military sales of the older [SAPI] products and if could discuss what opportunities might be out there under FMS?\nJerrold J. Pellizzon: Well the FMS let me address that first Michael that one is very difficult to predict there is an open line of communication now between the U.S. government and most of our allies this product has been made available to them and all these independent countries have to make the decision how they're going to spend the money. So, it's very hard for us to see that going forward, we check with the contracting officer and right now the second quarter to third quarter, we don't seen any large further releases, but that could change. So, that was a little hard to recall, if you get back to the long-term for the U.S. Military, no matter how you look at it Michael, you can't change the fact there. We as a nation have bought over 20 million rounds of the extract, we use it everyday in our automatic machine guns, there isn't finally fire issue in theatre and it's only a matter of time before the enemy starts using that as a sniper round. It's available now worldwide, its in naval forces right now, but when you have millions of rounds in the theatre, it's going to find its way into the bad guys hands. So, we see long-term that the army will have to more some kind of X protection or else we'll have friendly fire casualties and eventually we'll have sniper round issues. So, we think that the government as a minimum at some point will begin transitioning all replacement plates to be an X version so that they can pickup that protection going forward and long-term that will result in a transition of the fleet from the ESAPI protection to an X level of protection. Now, weight is the big issue and that's the challenge for this year we need to get at least some of the weight out of that system and get it down closer to the ESAPI weight and that's going to be the goal.\nMichael French \u2013 Morgan Joseph & Co.:  Okay, thank you. And to follow-up, I would like to ask about vehicle side, have there been any developments in the last quarter you care to discuss?\nJoel P. Moskowitz:  Marc.\nMarc King:  Hi, Michael.\nMichael French \u2013 Morgan Joseph & Co.: Hi Marc.\nMarc King:  There have been a number of things going on. I have to again, you have to allow me to calculate and comment in somewhat in generalities because of the agreements that we have with the companies that we work with and their competitive position in these opportunities, but we have been very, very active recently you might have noticed for example just this morning was an announcement on the release of the MA TV, two awards made, we are very active with one of those awardees as a major subcontractor, as one of those awardees for some of the component that will go into that vehicle. So, we are anxious to see how they do in there it's Aberdeen, to their vehicles were delivered to Aberdeen for ongoing testing. We have other opportunities with another light weight system that was shown here recently publicly that's of interest to Cercom, this is an old ceramic system, I am pleased to say very light weight armor application that now is going to move to the next level, we hope to see the vehicle deploy into our rack in the coming months for further valuation and hopefully move from there to production. We are, our LPAS have successfully been evaluated in a long-term durability study with the OEM, completed 20,000 miles of testing it did very well and we moved onto the next level with additional orders for that system and it's moving into the next phase of testing with the government and the OEM. But, like I said the number of things going on most of them are long-term opportunities we have several additional closed out with programs with Marine Corp. for the other things for the army. So, we are very optimistic that that 2009 is looking pretty good for vehicle armor opportunities.\nMichael French \u2013 Morgan Joseph & Co.: Okay. Thank you and good luck. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of [David Kaizer] of Robotti & Company.\nDavid Kaizer \u2013 Robotti & Company: Hi. Good morning guys. \nJoel P. Moskowitz: Good morning.\nDavid Kaizer \u2013 Robotti & Company: Excuse me, Joel. I have a little bit of the cold also, I am sorry not feeling well. On the solar side of the business, are you seeing starting to see pricing pressures or margin pressures at all and if so how are you handling that.\nJoel P. Moskowitz: In December, we saw a significant pressure on pricing in China and we met the competition because we don\u2019t want to loose market share. Outside of China we have been able to maintain our pricing, it seems the Europeans particularly are more launch recognized with differential between our products and our competitors. We still do not have a majority of that business, although our market share have been increasing. As far as the margins go, they're quite good even with the price reduction, we are very efficient and everything we have done particularly in China and more recently in the Atlanta, Georgia is the most modern automated equipment.\nDavid Kaizer \u2013 Robotti & Company: And what's the difference in market share in Europe and China. Where do you sell most of your products?\nJoel P. Moskowitz: I can't answer that directly, I just don't know those numbers. And I don't have the documents in front of me.\nDavid Kaizer \u2013 Robotti & Company: Okay.\nJoel P. Moskowitz: I know that everything we make in China, we are selling into China right now with a new factory it will be big enough that I would expect that we will exporting at least into Southeast Asia. In the United States, we probably have a very high percentage.\nDavid Kaizer \u2013 Robotti & Company: Okay. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alan Robinson of RBC.\nAlan Robinson \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just to follow on from the previous question slightly could you give us an idea of the approximate capacity utilization of your current solar crucible manufacturing operations in China and elsewhere?\nJoel P. Moskowitz: Yeah. I can give you some generalizations on that we are expecting to ship probably about $70 million this year of crucibles of which it would be kind of half-and-half we are currently putting in even without this internal expansions because we need special handling equipment for our new proprietary coding. And so it changes all the time, right now there, it's about a 50% split. As far as capacity utilization right now we're probably well in excess of 90%, while that continues in order to a question mark it seems to, the solar industry if you read all of the analysts and the reports has a lot of difficulties, but they don't really affect Ceradyne, the fact that the price of silicon has come down from $400 to say $150 a kilo, it can affect people who make silicon, the prior the fact that there are so many smaller players some of whom probably won\u2019t survive does not affect Ceradyne. What affects Ceradyne is the number of solar cells, which you can interpret as the number of gigawatts being produced and right now we're seeing a pretty good demand.\nAlan Robinson \u2013 RBC Capital Markets:  I understand that's an useful perspective. Thank you. And then just as I say my second question could you discuss any opportunities you have to expand your armor sales beyond the U.S. military customers you currently have?\nJoel P. Moskowitz:  Yes, I'll take that even though, but Dave could answer it probably better. Compared to the United States, foreign military sales generally have to be looked on as more or less first thing on the K, the number pay out and also the United States always at least in the armor has been way ahead of everybody else. We see the market advancing it's not insignificant, we will ship right now, we have about $41 million of orders on the books, order that we got not from outside of the United States, but from the U.S. that will be shipped to our friends and that's not insignificant, most of it is of the early SAPI, on the other hand because of our presence in Germany and because some of their soldiers had been killed in Iraq not so long ago there seems to be a significant movement to increase or not, even to begin to use our XSAPI design, we would make that in Germany, but to keep it in perspective. if we got the business they're projecting, which we anticipate it would be less than one month production for us.\nAlan Robinson \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you. I will step back in line.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Liebowitz of Wachovia Securities.\nGary Liebowitz \u2013 Wachovia Securities: Thanks. Dave you can remind us the side plate production, how long does the current contract take you out through and when would you need to receive in order to keep that line hot?\nDavid P. Reed: The current contract has ended, we completed all of the deliverables on that contract, in the end of December and so our line is actually continuing to be hot, because we are making the FMS products at this point. So, we are looking to transition into that hopefully in the late second quarter after we down the FMS orders.\nGary Liebowitz \u2013 Wachovia Securities:  Okay. And then the other question I have for Jerry, ESK you gave a number of a $110 million, when we think about the fixed cost in that business, I mean how profitable can that business be at that level of volume?\nJerrold J. Pellizzon: Well, I think, in this economy Gary, we are working hard to make sure that they sustain a profit, we are getting close to break-even on that. We really are thinking free cash flow, but we are working hard to reduce cost there, it's going to take a little longer than it would I think in the United States but nevertheless we are in a mode to reduce costs there to make it commensurate with the level of business. So, we'll be working hard to reduce cost there I think that's the order of the day, but we are looking at free cash flow and it will produce free cash flow there this year.\nGary Liebowitz \u2013 Wachovia Securities:  And if you plan on bringing headcount down consistent with sales volume I mean that would imply rather significant number of lay-offs so I mean is there were severance assumption built into the guidance?\nJerrold J. Pellizzon:  There is a slight amount of severance that we have included in the guidance, yes.\nGary Liebowitz \u2013 Wachovia Securities: Can you quantify that?\nJoel P. Moskowitz:  We're working on a number of programs now we've already reduced headcount here, we may go further we've gone through the process. In Europe we're taking advantage of what they call reduced hours with the German government actually subsidizes up to 18 months for reductions and pays about 67% or so for that period. The real question will be depending on what we do with certain facilities.\nGary Liebowitz \u2013 Wachovia Securities:  In Europe?\nJoel P. Moskowitz:  In Europe, to answer your question little more forward I'd be very happy if they broke it even this year.\nGary Liebowitz \u2013 Wachovia Securities:  Thanks Joe.\nJoel P. Moskowitz:  Okay.\nOperator:  There are no further questions at this time.\nJoel P. Moskowitz:  Okay I think we'll, now that I can talk again. We'll end this conference call. I appreciate everybody's good questions, the people on the phone are quite knowledgeable, it's a moving target some of these things we try to do our best and bring it in a timely manner Jerry and I are actually going to Europe in March, and we're going to take a real hard look at headcounts and certain operations. On the other hand as they developed a series of new products and we are not going to do anything until less than that. We are going to continue to look at preserving our cash, we are not going to be afraid to spend as we've announced in China. We are going to continue some stock buyback nobody ask that question, but it still, how much left Jerry on that?\nJerrold J. Pellizzon: $55 million \nJoel P. Moskowitz: We still have $55 million that's been authorized, and we are going to take a look at that after we get out of our quiet period. So, listen thanks a lot, we are working hard on this, we are not looking at into the Pollyanna and our position particularly in Europe is to assume whatever you think we are now assume it's going to get better for at least three quarters, and we are going to go on that move. So, thanks again and we will talk to you in about 90-days. Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

Welcome to the Ceradyne third quarter 2008 results conference call. This conference is being recorded today, October 28, 2008 at the request of Ceradyne. All participants are currently in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. We request the participants to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to allow others on the call an opportunity to participate. Hosting the call today is Joel Moskowitz, Ceradyne\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; who is accompanied by David Reed, President of North America operations; Jerry Pellizzon, Chief Financial Officer; Marc King, Vice President of Armor Operations; and Michael Kraft, Vice-President of Nuclear and Semiconductor Business Units. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Moskowitz, the company has requested that I read the following statement. The matters discussed in this conference call may include forwardlooking statements regarding future events and the future performance of Ceradyne that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in the company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year and due December 31, 2007 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Moskowitz. Please go ahead sir.\nJoel Moskowitz: Thank you, Mindy, and I\u2019m very pleased to have everybody on the line today for the teleconference regarding the reporting of our third quarter and nine-month 2008 financial results. In addition to the forward-looking statements that Mindy read, I\u2019d also like to remind everyone a recording is being made of this conference call. As our practice has been, before the market opened this morning, we issued a press release outlining our third quarter and nine-month 2008 financial results as well as providing guidance for the balance of 2008 for the entire year, the initial guidance for 2009, as well as some other comments regarding our outlook for your company. Briefly, I\u2019ll review the press release. We stated that the third quarter, we had sales of $167.7 million, that compared to $191.6 million of sales in the third quarter of last year 2007. Net income for the third quarter 2008 decreased by about $13.3 million or 40.6% to $19.4 million or $0.73 per diluted share. Now, that compared to $32.7 million or $1.16 per fully diluted share last year in the third quarter of \u201907. Now, that net income in the third quarter included the previously announced non-recurring pretax acquisition-related compensation charge of $9.8 million. We had announced that several times as we completed the SemEquip deal and that had to do with pre-closing commitments related to the SemEquip acquisition, which we acquired August of 2008, and that was used to pay certain incentive compensation to certain employees and advisors. The income number also included a pretax charge of $3 million that came from other than temporary reduction in the value of our investments in auction rate securities. These non-recurring after-tax acquisition-related charges amounted to $6.2 million or approximately $0.24 per fully diluted share, and the after-tax other than temporary reduction in the value of our investments was $1.9 million or $0.07. So, the two charges had a combined negative impact on the third quarter net income of $0.31 per fully diluted share. Now, the gross margins were 39.7% of net sales in Q3 of \u201908, and that compared to 39.6% in the same period last year. The provision for income tax was 36.1% in the Q3 of \u201908, and that compared to 39.6% of last year in the same period. The fully diluted average shares outstanding were 26.6 million in Q3, that compared to 28.1 million in the third quarter of 2007. And the lower average shares outstanding in the current quarter was due primarily to the purchase of 1.1 million shares under the company\u2019s stock repurchase program, which we announced in March 4, 2008. For the nine months, sales were $541.3 million for the period ending September 30, 2008, and that compared to $565.4 million last year in the same period. With net income for the nine months of \u201908 being $85.5 million or $3.18 per fully diluted share on 26.9 million, that compared to $109 million or $3.93 per fully diluted share on 27.7 million shares last year for the same nine-month period. Now, in that $3.18, you also have the same impact that we discussed above, namely, that the net income was reduced with a non-recurring pretax acquisition charge of $9.8 million that related to SemEquip and $3.5 million that related to the other than temporary reduction in the value of our investments in auction rate securities. These amounted to non-recurring after-tax charges of $0.32 per fully diluted share for the first nine months of 2008. The gross margin for the same nine-month period in \u201808 was 39.5% and that compared to 40.7% with the provision for income taxes of 36.3% in the first nine months of 2008, that compared to 37.1% same period last year. New bookings for Q3 2008 were $119.4 million and that compared to $163.6 million same period last year. And the nine months \u2013 for the total nine months, we booked $476.6 million in 2008 that compared to $395.3 million in the comparable period last year. The total backlog as of September 30, 2008 was $174.9 million that compares to last year of slightly less $173.1 million. Now in the press release where, because we\u2019re coming out with our total projections or guidance for \u201908 and as well as our initial guidance for \u201909, I stated that I thought it might be helpful to our shareholders, if we did give initial guidance for \u201909 and as well as discuss some of the areas that your management team continues to focus on. We now have a better visibility for all of \u201908, so we've tightened the range a bit to show sales of $695 million to $700 million for all of \u201908, and an earnings range of $4 to $4.15 per fully diluted share. Now, those earnings also include the $0.32 that we discussed in the paragraphs related to the SemEquip acquisition and the expenses related to other than temporary reduction in the value of our investments and auction rate securities. That compares \u2013 on September 10, we had provided guidance which these numbers the sales are slightly below the low-end of the guidance and the earnings range adding back to $0.32 would be higher than the lower-end of the guidance that we gave. And as you may recall, there was some question about XSAPI \u2013 how much we could ship in the fourth quarter, if we even had gotten the fourth XSAPI, and we did win that ID/IQ award which we announced, but it came in late enough that actually in Q4 we\u2019ll ship very little of XSAPI. We will ship some of the first article test parts and that\u2019s in the numbers that I just quoted for our guidance for the full year. Now, in October of 2008, we repeat that we had won the largest contract we ever got at Ceradyne, a five year XSAPI as well as ESAPI plate from the US Army at Aberdeen Proving Grounds for $2.37 billion, which is an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity generally called ID/IQ five-year contract. And we then received two initial to delivery orders amounting to $73 million which was the first article as well as production. In this press release, we announced yesterday October 27, the Department of Army issued a 120-day stop work order on the initial delivery order, which was named 0002, that\u2019s $72 million but we were allowed to continue working on the initial first article test order on the ID/IQ contract. I stated also that we believe that the stop work order is attributable to a protest filed by BAE Systems. We also anticipate that the protest will be resolved in a relatively short period of time. I\u2019m sure in the Q&A that someone will be asking Dave to comment on that. Although this ID/IQ contract is both for XSAPI and ESAPI, we expect the army will primarily order the XSAPI which would most likely result in total orders under this five- year procurement of less than the full $2.37 billion. And although we believe that the government may increase its requirements for XSAPI to a Pure Fleet. Pure Fleet is the language that\u2019s used when the government determines that they want every soldier, including National Guard or noncombatants, combatants, full deployment of XSAPI. Because we cannot project that decision at this time, we\u2019re assuming that our normal flow of XSAPI and ESAPI sustained and non-Pure Fleet XSAPI and Special Forces armor, if we add those numbers up, they come out to about $125 million short of what we shipped in 2008. That is the way we came up with our guidance for 2009. This reduction in shipments will be partially offset by increased sales of our ceramic crucibles, which will double to about $80 million in 2009, and increased sales in other non-defense areas such as our ESK Ceramics subsidiary in Germany. Now assuming no Pure Fleet increase, which is what we are assuming for the purposes of this initial guidance, our sales for next year would be $640 million to $650 million, with an earnings range of $3.00 to $3.25, and that assumes a tax rate of 36% and fully diluted average shares of $26.5 million. I went on to point out, because of the capital markets crisis, it is currently evident not only in the United States but worldwide that your company has a very strong balance sheet, particularly we have strong cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments totaling $215 million. In addition to that, which we usually don't site as cash because it\u2019s classified as a long-term investment are our auction rate securities, which are now in an illiquid status. The team, most of whom are on the phone right now, except for our operations that are far away, continues to focus on the areas that we have repeatedly discussed. We\u2019re working very hard on acquisitions, particularly defense products, including armor for military vehicles. We have Marc King on the phone. He may give us a little bit of information on that solar energy and \u2013 which continues to be a strong suit. I\u2019d like to mention in solar energy that we have developed a technical improvement to our traditional ceramic crucibles which we have filed a patent for and we expect this to be substantive in the marketplace as it will make a better ingot of silicon and that will release cleanly from the crucible, as well as our ceramics for smelting of aluminum. It is interesting to know, and for those of you who\u2019ve been following Ceradyne, remember that I\u2019ve been following this since the first day 41 years ago, that we do have a decline in body armor shipments. That\u2019s what we\u2019re projecting for 2009 with our current visibility, assuming no Pure Fleet and it will be about 40% of our shipments. Now, as we look at it at Ceradyne, we\u2019re moving towards our goal of a diversified company and a lot of that will be based on the sales growth in the future in these non-defense areas. However, even with this decline that we\u2019re projecting next year, even with partially being offset by non-defense, we expect it will continue to generate strong monthly cash flows and that we\u2019re all very excited, actually, about what we see in the marketplace. We\u2019re planning to expand our solar operations in China, possibly Singapore, for sure Atlanta, Georgia is expanding, and we continue to put in capital expenditures in our non-defense areas in Germany, we are looking for record years out of ESK Ceramics, and a small subsidiary area that they run. But the plans, because of continued increase in the demand for our ceramic silicon carbide products for pump seals and bearings, which is a very important part of ESK\u2019s non-defense programs. So I think that a more lengthy press release than we normally put out gives you the factual information on Q3, on the balance of \u201908, how we see things in \u201909, our continued focus in these various areas. And I\u2019m going to turn this over now as we\u2019ve been doing in recent calls to Jerry Pellizzon, Ceradyne\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, who will give you a little bit of an overview of some of the financial aspects that he wants to highlight. Jerry?\nJerry Pellizzon: Thank you, Joel. A pleasant good morning to everybody wherever you may be. We have a revenue diversification trend that began in Q3 \u201907, continued again into this quarter and for the nine months. And it\u2019s interesting to note that the non-armor, non-defense business of Ceradyne had record sales for the year-to-date and record sales for any quarter, and also record earnings contribution. That is driven by our crucible business, not only in China but also in Atlanta, but also other areas of the business, the fluid handling at ESK, our broad metallurgy business at ESK. So we\u2019re seeing some solid growth into that business. The percentage of revenue from our business now is \u2013 has declined at 62% from 73% of the revenue compared to the same period in \u201907; and so we've really got solid business there. Non-defense sales year-to-date are $205 million versus $136 million in \u201907, so you got a growth rate of 50%. If you net up your contributions of the 2007 acquisitions from the growth rate of 35% and the sales to date are $173 million versus $128 million. So, we\u2019re really pleased about our performance of the non-industrial business and we\u2019re very optimistic about it for the future. In terms of income from operations, we did declined by $15.1 million before the impact of the charge for the acquisition of the SemEquip, but we did deliver a very healthy 26.2% operating profit margin and our annualized pretax return on capital was 22.3%. So basically, there\u2019s a fact that the selling, general and administrative expenses related to the incremental revenue of our non-defense business are generally higher than those attributable to body armor. So, replacing body armor revenue dollar-for-dollar cannot expect to generate equivalent profit margins but still contribute very, very good incremental profits. So in general, the results of the first nine months of 2008 reflect our strategy of expanding our business through internal growth and strategic acquisitions. Free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 amounted to $91.5 million versus $62.2 million in the comparable period last year. EBITDA was $161 million for the nine months, compared to $188 million during the same period the year before. Our depreciation and amortization is $30 million for the nine months. We were at $18 million last year. Our CapEx was $36 million and compared to $28.3 million last year. So overall, we\u2019ve seen a healthy growth of our non-industrial, non-defense business. We\u2019re still producing good healthy returns. The balance sheet, as Joel noted, is rock-solid. We continue to produce cash; we\u2019re going to produce cash in 2009 also. So we\u2019re anticipating that we\u2019ll build our cash position. And as we mentioned, we do have a buyback program with about $65 million left on it, so we have ample cash. And in today\u2019s credit constrained era, it's probably one of our most valuable assets that we have on our balance sheet. Additionally, our DSOs continue to go in the right direction. They\u2019re now a record low 28 days compared to 43 days for the prior year. So I think that the note on the balance sheet is that strong liquidity, strong cash position, and the note on the operating side is that we continue to perform on an excellent basis for manufacturing companies. Joel?\nJoel Moskowitz: Thanks a lot, Jerry. I think, Mindy, it would be most productive if we go right into the Q&A period, so we can bring everybody into the act and answer any questions from the people on the line.\nOperator: (Operator instructions) Your first question comes from Pierre Maccagno from Needham. Your line is open.\nPierre Maccagno \u2013 Needham: Good morning, Joel and Jerry.\nJoel Moskowitz: Hi, Pierre.\nJerry Pellizzon: Good morning, Pierre.\nPierre Maccagno \u2013 Needham: So, could you give us a little bit of an explanation on the reduced shipments in \u201909 versus \u201908? Is that because there\u2019s a reduced demand or there\u2019s a change in market share? And also if you could tell us, in terms of the number of sets shipped per month, how much of that is that you expect in \u201909 versus \u201908?\nJoel Moskowitz: Yes, I think that, as I stated, the decrease is almost solely attributable to body armor, even though we just got a $2.3 billion ID/IQ order, the biggest we\u2019ve ever seen. But really, what really counts is delivery orders and we\u2019re looking at it what I hope will be conservatively. But I think the best one to answer that question is the Vice President and President in the North American Operations who lives the armor game, Dave Reed. Dave?\nDavid Reed: Hi, Pierre. Let me give you a little flavor for that. The last time we all spoke, we really were not under contract. We had passed some of the testing that would allow us to go into the contract base. So, as everyone is seeing, we are now officially under contract. We\u2019re one of three companies that will participate over the next five years on the XSAPI Program, so that\u2019s great news for us. We\u2019re very anxious to move ahead with the program. We\u2019ll be submitting first article parts this week. Testing will take place over the next month, month and a half and then we expect that within that same time period, there\u2019ll be some kind of resolution of the protest. To answer your question directly, it looks like the army itself, initial order is only for about 120,000 sets for the next year, and I think they\u2019re probably going a little slow because they have some nervousness about how the companies will perform on this new product. It\u2019s a very difficult product to make. It\u2019s really the next generation. It has to stop a much more demanding threat in the prior ESAPI product. And I think maybe once the government gets through that first article testing and has a chance to look at the performance of Ceradyne and maybe our competitors too that they may be a little bit more bullish about rolling the product out, so we\u2019ll certainly be lobbying for that. We know for sure that this is a friendly fire issue right now. It\u2019s certainly the new ammunition that\u2019ll be showing up in the coming years on any battlefield that we\u2019ll see, so for our soldiers not to have the XSAPI will be a bad decision and I don\u2019t think really anybody in the Congress, Senate or the Army wants that to happen. So we\u2019re looking right now at about 8,500 sets a month between Army and Marine and Air Force requirements next year for the XSAPI. And we\u2019re also anticipating that at some point, they\u2019ll move the side plate program into that. And we\u2019re expecting maybe about 11,000 sets of the side plate, and that\u2019s in our forecast also, Pierre.\nPierre Maccagno \u2013 Needham: So, when you say 120,000 sets for next year, is that the whole industry or is that you? And also if you can talk about \u2013\nDavid Reed: No, that\u2019s the army\u2019s requirement.\nPierre Maccagno \u2013 Needham: Okay. And you get more or less what percentage of that, would you say?\nDavid Reed: On its first delivery order, the 0002, we got about 63%.\nPierre Maccagno \u2013 Needham: Okay. And you expect that to continue forward?\nDavid Reed: Well, I certainly hope so.\nPierre Maccagno \u2013 Needham: Okay. And my follow-up question is the gross margins, are these dropping or is that changing at all?\nDavid Reed: I\u2019ll let Jerry answer that one.\nPierre Maccagno \u2013 Needham: Okay.\nJerry Pellizzon: Well, Pierre, there\u2019s a sales mix issue that \u2013 and also we had a competitive bid so the margins are forecasted down for \u201809 versus \u201907. We do have opportunities to increase it from our plan, but I think they\u2019re going to be lower than they were in \u201908, primarily because of the sales mix issue, the product themselves and how we bid. And if you look at the first quarter, the first quarter of the year we are going to be down in gross margin and we\u2019re expecting that to be the weakest quarter of the four, but we\u2019re very confident about the number. But, the first quarter of 2009 will be our weakest quarter, primarily because of sales mix. Once we get past the contract that we have on the books that will be produced and shipped in the first quarter, then the margins for the next few quarters will I think increase and they will be much better.\nPierre Maccagno \u2013 Needham: So, when you talk about the sales mix, what do you mean specifically? I mean, some of the plates have lower margins or lower ASPs or \u2013?\nJerry Pellizzon: Pierre, as you saw in the past couple of months here, we\u2019ve announced some new orders. We in particular got quite a bit of orders placed for foreign military sales of the two generations ago SAPI product. That has to be much more competitively bid. Those margins are quite a bit lower than what we can see on the most advanced products. So that\u2019s primarily going to be shipped in the first quarter of next year and so that drags down the total. The total amount of shipments will probably be a little higher for body armor in Q1, but the gross margins in dollars will about be equal across all the quarters but in percentage it will be a little bit lower in Q1.\nPierre Maccagno \u2013 Needham: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Josephine Millward from Stanford Group, your line is open.\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Stanford Group: Good morning.\nJoel Moskowitz: Good morning Josephine.\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Stanford Group: Joel, can you give us a little more color behind the BAE protest? What is the basis of their protest and why do you think this will be resolved shortly, and also in your guidance, are you assuming shipment of XSAPI in Q1 at all?\nDavid Reed: Hi Josephine, this is Dave. Let me take that answer. The basis of the protest appears to be that BAE is looking at the new laws that regulate the indefinite quantity, indefinitely delivery orders, which say that for each new delivery, you have to come out to the qualified bidders on that contract and ask them to resubmit their schedule for the products and a quote for the product. And so on this order, the army actually placed the first article test and contract on a Friday. And then two days later, two business days later, on Tuesday, they released the first delivery order that is 0002. So BAE didn\u2019t get a large portion from what we can see and so they\u2019re a little upset by that. And so they protested that that second delivery order should have officially been re-bid, that they should have had a chance over that two-day period to give a new quote for that production volume of 120,000 units. We anticipate that this will be resolved quickly because it doesn\u2019t seem to be that complex of an issue. The GAO is going to look at it and either say re-bid it or no we don\u2019t agree with you, the Army did come out a week prior and asked for best and final and this doesn\u2019t qualify.\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Stanford Group: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. So your guidance assumes shipment of XSAPI starting in January?\nDavid Reed: Yes, it does.\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Stanford Group: Okay. Also, in your backlog, does that include the $72 million of XSAPI order that you announced in October?\nDavid Reed: Yes.\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Stanford Group: Can you give us an update on vehicle armoring?\nJoel Moskowitz: Yes. I think that I have Marc on the line in Washington, and maybe he can give you an overview of where we stand on some of our programs. Marc?\nMarc King: Yes, hi Josephine. Good morning.\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Stanford Group: Hi, Marc.\nMarc King: Overall, we\u2019re pretty optimistic with our efforts to date regarding the use of our successful development of LTAS. We have now delivered to one of our OEMs a complete LTAS kit that\u2019s in full testing for the United States Army for the primary cargo truck used by the Army \u2013 medium duty cargo truck used by the Army as part of its B-Kit for armoring that is in an Army test now, and we expect to see some results back in probably about 90 to 120 days on that. We\u2019re in development with another OEM. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t give you these names because of nondisclosure agreements that we have. But for other armor kits deals that were negotiated at the recent Army exhibition in Washington, the folks back in Wixom, Michigan are working on new designs for B-Kits for additional armored trucks that we plan to present as part of army requirements going forward in the not too distant future. And most importantly, I think probably the latest buzz has to do with a new vehicle that just became a requirement, a result of the joint operational need statement coming from our forces in Afghanistan that is referred to as JUON [ph], which has just recently, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read in the open press, that JUON has become a requirement and that requirement is being turned into a request for proposal. I guess optimistically we look at that knowing that in a previous request for information, we have submitted to the Tank-Automotive Command in Detroit a response to that RFI using the same technology used in our BULL submission earlier. That RFI was singled out by the group at TACOM doing this evaluation. We\u2019ve been told that the information we provided and that all of the requirements of the JUON, we assume it will translate into the RFP and we\u2019re leaning very forward in the foxhole so to speak looking for an opportunity here to provide an RFP back on what we hope will be as many as 2,000 vehicles to support operations in Afghanistan.\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Stanford Group: Marc, can you help us quantify the three opportunities you listed and clarify what\u2019s included in your \u201809 guidance?\nDavid Reed: Well Josephine, let me jump in there because I just finished reviewing that budget portion. We\u2019ve got $30 million worth of shipments right now in the plan, primarily related to the shipment of B-Kit style armor that Marc spoke about. We have nothing in there for his comments on that BULL light program. That would be additional upside potential next year.\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Stanford Group: Okay. And the big B-Kit is to the OEF for army cargo trucks, right?\nDavid Reed: That\u2019s correct.\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Stanford Group: Great, thank you very much.\nJoel Moskowitz: Thank you, Josephine.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gary Liebowitz from Wachovia, your line is open.\nGary Liebowitz \u2013 Wachovia: Good morning gentlemen.\nJoel Moskowitz: Hi, Gary.\nGary Liebowitz \u2013 Wachovia: Could you clarify \u2013 I thought I heard you say that you still expect first deliveries of XSAPI to be in January? I thought that the original production \u2013 delivery due dates were January and February. Now, with this potentially four-month stay, you\u2019re still saying it\u2019s January?\nDavid Reed: Well, the way that rolls out is that we expect the first article to be approved probably end of November or early December. And then, we also expect the protest to be resolved pretty quickly, because as I said earlier, it\u2019s not a difficult issue. It\u2019s either they come out and ask for the re-bid or it\u2019s overruled and the existing contract stand. In either case, they only have two days to ask for a re-bid and not make an award or the original one stands. So there\u2019s not much to happen there. The deliveries on the existing contract call for February deliveries and you can deliver early on that, so we will be looking to make our first deliveries at the end of January right now.\nGary Liebowitz \u2013 Wachovia: Okay, I understand. Also, I just want to ask about the body armor, can you talk about some of the trends in the other businesses? It looks like sales out of the Canadian business almost completely dried up in the quarter. What was happening there and what\u2019s happening with the ESK margins?\nJoel Moskowitz: I think on Ceradyne Canada, I will let Michael Kraft to comment on that and then we will chime in with ESK.\nMichael Kraft: Hi Gary, this is Michael Kraft. The Canada operations are based on a product line as you know that we acquired (inaudible) and historically that\u2019s the product line that you run pretty much three quarters out of the year, and the prior owner had shut down and taken a layoff and really operate the business about three quarters out of the year. So, that\u2019s what we see in Q3, the seasonality of the business and it really doesn\u2019t reflect anything that we see and looking in nuclear from a market slowdown or really any kind of loss in market share. Jerry, do you want to take the ESK?\nJerry Pellizzon: Yes, the ESK, we did have some challenges during the quarter. Part of it is that their shipments overall of armor were down and they just didn\u2019t have enough revenue to absorb all their manufacturing overhead. We continue to face challenges on pricing for the evaporation boats. That\u2019s had a negative contribution \u2013 period-over-period year-to-date, there\u2019s about $2 million of gross margin that were off in that business. But the rest of their lines are doing well. Their fluid handling parts were parts that are doing well, but between armor and the reduction in the volume and the evaporation boats, that\u2019s what really contributed to that change.\nJoel Moskowitz: Yes, one point on that to those who follow ESK, they\u2019ll see about a 15% bump in sales in \u201909, and they\u2019re going to be focusing on their margins. I agree wholeheartedly with Jerry. One, when we see an armor turned down, it means we\u2019re buying less powder from them, which we let them mark up and that goes right to their margins. On the area of the evaporation boats, we have instituted a series of price increases which will be reflected towards the end of this year, end of Q4. And right now, they\u2019re holding and we\u2019re taking a pretty firm position on that. And the CEO and President, Thomas Juengling, has a very clear mandate to be looking at the bottom line. Remember, this is a pretty interesting company. It\u2019s been around since 1922. It was their research department that came up with this breakthrough methodology on the crucibles working with Bruce Lockhart and his team in Atlanta. They get credit for that, actually, and I think you\u2019re going to see this regarding the armor. I mean, we\u2019ll still be getting powders from them next year. You\u2019re going to see some margin improvement as we go forward.\nGary Liebowitz \u2013 Wachovia: Okay. And just one last one back on the body armor, how do you think the \u2013 it seems like the Army is looking for a comparable way to do XSAPI as it was for ESAPI but with the extra protection. Where do you stand there? How overweight are you now? And do you think if you get your number down that the market might actually open up a fair amount for you?\nDavid Reed: Well, I think, Gary, that the weight issue is something that everybody needs to understand a little bit better themselves, even the Army in many cases. The new improved Outer Tactical Vest has taken out some coverage issues, particularly on the side plate. They've reduced the weight of the soft side armor by about 3.2 pounds, so a whole suite of X front and back and side at the maximum allowable 10% only adds about 1.7 pounds. So overall, the average guy who doesn\u2019t have either one of these items right now would see about over a pound reduction in the total weight he\u2019s carrying, so I think that there\u2019s some education required there to some of the people that are funding the programs, but we don\u2019t see it as a big issue. We\u2019re somewhere just below the 10% overweight number compared to ESAPI right now, and we think that that product affords great protection. It\u2019s going to look pretty silly if a guy is going to be killed in friendly fire issues going forward because he wasn\u2019t give a plate that would stop what we\u2019re shooting out of our automatic weapons. And I think that overall the army\u2019s going to make the right decision there and it\u2019s definitely being supported by Congress.\nGary Liebowitz \u2013 Wachovia: Okay, thank you.\nJoel Moskowitz: Thank you, Gary.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jiwon Lee from Sidoti & Company. Your line is open.\nJiwon Lee \u2013 Sidoti and Company: Good morning.\nJoel Moskowitz: Good morning.\nJiwon Lee \u2013 Sidoti and Company: My first question is on the solar cell crucibles. Projecting about $80 million for next year, is this level a little bit below your previous projection? And how should we be thinking about this business growing beyond next year?\nJoel Moskowitz: Well, that\u2019s a very good question. This year earlier on I said I thought that our shipments would be $40 million to $50 million and now, it looks like they\u2019re coming in a little more than $40 million, and the $80 million looks pretty firm. I thought it could be more in \u201909 earlier last year, and then we were a little concerned because of the shortage of silicon. That shortage of silicon seems to be an issue but our customers are able to use a commodity grade metal specification instead of the normally ultra high purity silicon, and so the 80 million comes out by \u2013 it\u2019s their numbers to us. We\u2019re not going by generalities. As far as the future goes, it looks pretty good. It looks about as good as I can imagine. Every analysis that I\u2019ve seen and more important, what our customers say, is a growth rate of between 35% and 40%, which is about what it\u2019s been growing lately. So if that\u2019s true, then our business should continue to grow at that kind of number if not more if we\u2019re correct, and I know you know a lot about our business, Jiwon. If I\u2019m right and this coating, which we call a pre-coded crucible, is as good as it seems, we will increase market share. Right now, I\u2019m looking \u2013 our numbers are growing at about the same rate as the market. The other thing is the basic technology, it\u2019s called polycrystalline silicon; and although there are competitive methodologies for making solar cells, namely thin film and various types of mirrors that rotate and track or concentrate sunlight, it still looks like the poly is the material of choice because it\u2019s so mature with about 65% of the total solar market. So I think we\u2019re in pretty good shape.\nJiwon Lee \u2013 Sidoti & Company: Okay. And back to the body armor, that is my follow-up question, where do we stand or what does the Army tell you about the side plate and your conversion to the X-Type?\nDavid Reed: Well, Jiwon, it makes very little sense to provide some these forward groups with front and back protection that stops their friendly fire issue, the extra [ph] without giving them sides, so the army has said that they will follow the XSAPI program with their side plate program within 30 to 60 days. That\u2019s what in our plan. We\u2019re showing that we\u2019ll be delivering late in Q1, early Q2 an X version of the side plate.\nJiwon Lee \u2013 Sidoti & Company: Your market share there is considerably bigger than the chest plates though right now, yes?\nDavid Reed: Yes, that\u2019s always been true. We\u2019ve always held a pretty high position in that.\nJiwon Lee \u2013 Sidoti & Company: Okay, that\u2019s all for me. Thank you.\nJoel Moskowitz: Thank you, Jiwon.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Quillin from Stephens Incorporated. Your line is open.\nTim Quillin \u2013 Stephens Inc.: Good morning.\nJoel Moskowitz: Good morning.\nDavid Reed: Hi, Tim.\nTim Quillin \u2013Stephens Inc.: In terms of body armor, how should we think about fourth quarter sales relative to third quarter?\nDavid Reed: Right now, it looks we\u2019re going to be down a little bit in the fourth quarter. I think we\u2019re going to be about $80 million.\nTim Quillin \u2013 Stephens Inc.: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Is that the shipments as well of the foreign military sales orders?\nDavid Reed: Just a very little bit of that is going out in December, that\u2019s the start of those orders. Most of that downturn reflects not getting any of the XSAPI out. We had thought originally that we might see some shipments in late November, early December but because of the delay that shifted that product into early next year.\nTim Quillin \u2013 Stephens Inc.: Okay. And just a point of clarification, I thought earlier on the call, you said that the $72 million order for XSAPI was included in your backlog but I think it\u2019s excluded. Is that correct?\nJoel Moskowitz: That was included.\nTim Quillin \u2013 Stephens Inc.: Okay. In your 10-Q, it says specifically that it\u2019s excluded.\nDavid Reed: Well, the difference there, Tim, is that it was an October order and as of September 30, it wasn\u2019t included. As of the current backlog, which I think was a question before, not to create confusion, but I think it\u2019s totally \u2013 it\u2019s in the course, but the 9/30, it was not.\nTim Quillin \u2013 Stephens Inc.: Right, right. And what would you \u2013 so did you mention your current backlog, what is your current backlog?\nJoel Moskowitz: The backlog is quoted in my report that I gave paraphrasing the press release is as September 30. So it does not include the $72 million even though when I was to stay outside, I misspoke, because you\u2019re right, that came in after the close of Q3.\nTom Quillin \u2013 Stephens Incorporated: Now, that\u2019s a helpful clarification. And then, in terms of operating expense management as revenue declined into 2009, can you bring SG&A cost down or R&D cost down or your selling expenses down, and how does SemEquip factor into your expenses as well as we go into \u201909? Thank you.\nJerry Pellizzon: Okay. Why don\u2019t we go to SemEquip and I\u2019ll let Michael answer that?\nMichael Kraft: Well, from SemEquip\u2019s standpoint, we have a plan to build this business. We have a plan right now for \u201809 based on some of the softening to reduce those expenses, and we\u2019re just looking at forecasting those \u201809 numbers right now, and certainly, we\u2019re not going to be conservative but we\u2019re certainly going to be smart about bringing those numbers in line as a percentage. I mean, I think that\u2019s the best I can tell you. Overall, I think we\u2019re doing that in all of our business. I don\u2019t know, Jerry, if you want to add anything to that.\nJoel Moskowitz: Well, one thing on SemEquip, I want to make it clear. We said that we would \u2013 this is a star \u2013 effectively a late stage startup. And what Michael said is absolutely so, we are reducing our cost there. But we have in our numbers next year, what we anticipate will be a loss of about $6 million and that\u2019s already built into that number.\nJerry Pellizzon: Just to clarify, that $6 million is pretax? So we\u2019re looking at a $4 million post tax loss in that business?\nJoel Moskowitz: So that\u2019s already in the numbers that we put out, Tom.\nJerry Pellizzon: And also, Tom, as to answer your question before about current backlog, it\u2019s now at $220 million as of Monday.\nTom Quillin \u2013 Stephens Incorporated: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael French from Morgan Joseph. Your line is open.\nMichael French \u2013 Morgan Joseph: Good morning gentleman.\nJoel Moskowitz: Yes. Hi, Michael.\nMichael French \u2013 Morgan Joseph: I have a question about new investments and expanding operations and establishing new operations. I\u2019m just wondering if you could discuss the plans here and particularly if you could talk about CapEx and the timing and magnitude of any new sales?\nJoel Moskowitz: Well yes. What I\u2019ll do is I\u2019ll discuss some of the opportunities we are looking at, and then I\u2019ll let Jerry come in with some of the plans we have for CapEx particularly in 2009. When I mentioned these locations, in China we have began the process, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s absolutely complete yet, applying additional 13.7 acres in Tianjin, and that\u2019s primarily for the crucibles which as I say we expect to double next year. Most of these shipments will be within the country of China. However, there\u2019s another market that\u2019s growing in China for our ESK products and we\u2019re evaluating whether we want to put additional manufacturing facilities in Tianjin to make these silicon carbide components for industrial applications, so that\u2019s number one. Number two, I mentioned Singapore. It\u2019s actually a variety of other places, mostly in South East Asia. Again, we\u2019re focused on the few silica ceramics with our new patented or patent applied for pre-coding and we\u2019re doing that because we\u2019re developing a strategy of establishing our crucible supply chain as close as we can to the user. It\u2019s worked out quite successfully now, both in the States where we deliver to people like BP, so we are in Maryland, and in China, where we deliver to the major solar producers, and it looks like Southeast Asia is the next place that our customers are going so we\u2019re doing that. Now, I also mentioned Germany, and that comes about because of our expansion and particularly in two product lines which includes both building and equipment and capacity that silicone carbide which is about almost 25% of their business now and growing. And we actually are starting to bump into capacity, so we\u2019re expanding there and we\u2019re expanding in the operation as I said. And the other area is boron nitride where we are becoming more aggressive on our marketing for both metallurgical applications and as I mentioned before cosmetics. Jerry, you want to talk a little bit about some numbers related to \u2013?\nJerry Pellizzon: Sure. The color on the numbers of CapEx next year is about $40 million. We\u2019re having the plan now and ironically our depreciation and amortization is about that number also, so you can look for about $80 million of cash flow next year and those capital expenditures, and of course the bulk of those are dedicated towards the expansion in China in which we anticipate opening that facility early Q4 of 2009 and we\u2019ve had very good results often enough both the facility in China. It\u2019s specifically laid out to produce crucibles so we got high production rates. So you\u2019re looking at about $80 million of cash flow next year and a CapEx of about $40 million.\nMichael French \u2013 Morgan Joseph: Okay thank you. I have a question and a follow up on the body armor side. Maybe this is for Dave. Where was the number of sets associated with the $72 million order that you just got?\nDavid Reed: Well I\u2019m not really going to go into any of the details because as I said this may be re-bid so we\u2019re just trying to keep that a little bit tight to the best there, Michael.\nMichael French \u2013 Morgan Joseph: Okay. And you did mention one number, your run rate at 85,000 sets a month. Are you planning that for the full 12 months?\nDavid Reed: All but December \u2013 I mean all but January.\nMichael French \u2013 Morgan Joseph: What\u2019s the number in January?\nDavid Reed: It\u2019s probably five or six, something like that.\nMichael French \u2013 Morgan Joseph: Okay, thank you and good luck.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ben Mackovak from Rivanna Capital. Your line is open.\nBen Mackovak \u2013 Rivanna Capital: Hi, guys. What would 2009 look like with appear freight increase?\nJoel Moskowitz: Well, it depends to what level that you accelerate shipment. It could be anywhere worth of another $50 million.\nBen Mackovak \u2013 Rivanna Capital: Okay. Once stayed down, it\u2019s fully transition to a more diversified company, however long that may be? What percent it fell do you think will still come from defense?\nJoel Moskowitz: Well, in our annual report last year, we talked about a target of a billion dollar company, a 50% defense. The vehicle armor which is still small, you heard we got about $30 million planned which is less than 5% of sales next year. There\u2019s a whole different game. When Marc talked about a few thousand vehicles to the new specifications coming out of Afghanistan, these are hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of vehicle probably. So I mean these numbers are very large. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to see. Will see body armor \u2013 the good thing about body armor I know that people discount a lot of this. That\u2019s the ID/I Q contract has been the biggest solidifying base we\u2019ve ever had. We\u2019ve never had visibility like that. It\u2019s true they can order anything they want. That\u2019s always been the case with the ID/IQ and for sure you can count on it being less than the $42.3 billion but it\u2019s five years, and the facts are that the most of the ID/IQs we got, and it\u2019s usually two or three years, I think almost always the government is going over the top. Usually to implementing either what they call a surge or just ordering more than what was on the contract by explaining that it is due dates, so we\u2019re pretty comfortable at a lower level about a steady level of armor for quite a long period of time.\nBen Mackovak \u2013 Rivanna Capital: Okay, good, thanks. \nJoel Moskowitz: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gifford Combs from Dalton. Your line is open.\nGifford Combs \u2013 Dalton: Hi. I just wanted to ask if you had any thoughts about speeding up your stock buy back program in light of what\u2019s happened to the stock price today.\nJoel Moskowitz: Sure. That\u2019s the answer.\nGifford Combs \u2013 Dalton: You want to quantify sure?\nJoel Moskowitz:  We have $65 million. We bought about a million shares, totaling a little more than $30 million. And we have some self-imposed idea of how to do this. I don\u2019t want to quantify it anymore than that but we obviously are very interested in buying stock back.\nGifford Combs \u2013 Dalton: Thank you.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Brent Reed [ph] from FBR. Your line is open.\nBrent Reed \u2013 FBR: Good morning. My question has to do with potential side plates for the XSAPI contract. Is there currently an RP associated with those side plates?\nJoel Moskowitz: No.\nBrent Reed \u2013 FBR: Do you see \u2013 is this what you were seeing? I believe it was 30 to 60 days after the XSAPI contract that you were looking for?\nJoel Moskowitz: Well, we expect the governments to make some moves in that area pretty soon. You know we\u2019ll just have to wait and see what they\u2019re timing is but as I said we don\u2019t see anything in our plan until probably end of Q1 as we do the shipments of that products so that\u2019s about five months away.\nBrent Reed \u2013 FBR: Okay and just one follow-up to that. As far the side plates are concerned, do you see any potential of this being a potential conversion of the current side plate contract?\nJoel Moskowitz: Well, as you know, that\u2019s a multi-year program that does allow engineering changes to take place so it\u2019s possible.\nBrent Reed \u2013 FBR: Okay, thank you.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from David Keyser [ph] from Abadi [ph] & Company. Your line is open.\nDavid Keyser \u2013 Abadi & Company: Good morning, guys.\nJerry Pellizzon: Good morning, David.\nDavid Keyser \u2013 Abadi & Company: I just want you to clarify on the acquisition front. Where are you looking, how big are you looking to go, and how quickly things are different and that sort of thing, if you can clarify that?\nJoel Moskowitz: Yes, I think I can comment on that. Right now, we\u2019re so comfortable where we are meaning having all these cash generated continuing Jerry\u2019s numbers that he put out the next year is \u2013 he said $80 million in free cash flow. That\u2019s almost $5 million a month generated and that\u2019s assuming we\u2019re putting money into SemEquip which we plan to do right from the beginning. The question on the acquisitions is that \u2013 we\u2019re not looking right now at a major acquisition. The fine is more than a $100 million or so. We have several smaller ones that fit right into our mode of acquiring companies that go in to current core businesses. We\u2019re looking at some smaller competitive but we\u2019re moving slow and conservatively right now as we see the debts settling in the financial markets. We think there\u2019s going to be some opportunities that have nothing to do with performance and everything to do with unit price. It\u2019s a good place for us to be to have this type of award chest [ph]. I would say you will not see any short-term acquisitions of substance meaning the next nine years or 120 days but you will probably see something next year.\nDavid Keyser \u2013 Abadi & Company: And a follow up on that, so you\u2019re really counting then on the core business that you have in the \u2013 the young businesses that you have to grow and then support the more diversified revenue-based more so than making an acquisition to do so?\nJoel Moskowitz:  That\u2019s absolutely correct.\nDavid Keyser \u2013 Abadi & Company: Okay, thank you very much guys.\nJoel Moskowitz: Sure.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from Bryce Dille from JMP Securities. Your line is open\nBryce Dille \u2013 JMP Securities: Hi guys. Thank you for taking my call. Just a question on the XSAPI contract. From my understanding, each new award [ph] against the offsetting ID/IQ is going to be competitively bid. Can you talk about the frequency of upcoming bids? Are they going to be annual or semiannual or what type of timeframe?\nJoel Moskowitz: Well, we moved to an industry trying to get that added in to the main budget starting in 2010 body armor. It\u2019s been coming out of supplemental money, as you know, for the past six years, seven years. So if that happens, then we would look more at annual awards. Right now, we expect that there will be additional opportunities to bid on marine business and potentially, some air force business; and those would probably be independent reviews. And again, when the army comes out for that, the language of the contract says that they look at the risk, the delivery, the price, and the sustainment [ph] of the industrial base as their four categories for making those decisions on the delivery orders.\nBryce Dille \u2013 JMP Securities: And then just a follow-up. Provided they stay competitively bid, will the army continue to accept protests going forward?\nDavid Reed: The army doesn\u2019t have any choice on anything, guys. I mean, any company in that mix can protest, that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s America, but the GAO then has to rule on that. This is new territory because the law changed last year. I think everybody\u2019s a little frustrated with it. I suspect that the GAO themselves will be putting a little pressure back on Congress to clarify this because right now, as you just said, anybody could protest any one of those and there\u2019s always a delay involved, and none of that\u2019s really good for the sustainment of any of our military industries right now. But as I said, I think these issues typically are cleared up pretty fast on this kind of issue compared to some of the more complicated ones involved around the testing of the product like the last protest. So I don\u2019t see this one taking very long to resolve itself and we\u2019re looking at it, as Joel said, a very good base of business with the army over the next five years with this contract. So on our last talk, we didn\u2019t have a base. We didn\u2019t know what the army was going to do. Now, they are committing to the initial adoption of XSAPI. As everybody knows in the past, we started with SAPI, then they adopted ESAPI and everybody got ESAPI. Now, they\u2019re starting with the adoption of XSAPI, and we expect that all of our forces will be protected against friendly fire in the future, guys. So it looks like, as Joel said, a lower base but a very good base over the next five years, so I\u2019m pretty excited about that and I\u2019m looking forward to doing a good job for the army.\nJoel Moskowitz: Before we take the next question, I wanted to bring in a separate subject that I thought people might ask about but haven\u2019t, and that\u2019s the very large future market for a smelting of aluminum. We\u2019ve brought this up constantly. We\u2019re doing a few million dollars a year. Probably, that would be about the same in \u201909. But recently, we\u2019ve accelerated our efforts and have actually formed an ad hoc test force headed by the President of ESK Ceramics, Thomas Jungling, which includes various senior people in the industry that we\u2019re retaining to help us penetrate and accelerate this market. And I just want to put out some more information so that everybody understands that this is one remainder of the two billion dollar markets that we referred to; one, of course, we\u2019ve already mentioned which is armor for military vehicles, and this is the other one. When you make aluminum, you produce more carbon dioxide than you do aluminum. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and the World Bank, where Ceradyne is in communications with, is monitoring the Kyoto Protocol and would state that the target will be 5% less CO2 based on a 1990 base, which is equivalent to about 26% reduction from here. So here you have a whole industry putting out perhaps as much as 100 million tons of carbon dioxide. The two largest polluters in Canada are aluminum companies, and aluminum is going to be one of the materials that will help our environment, will help our economy because of its light weight, weighing about 30% of the weight of the steel. And Ceradyne believes it has a solution to reduce the cost, reduce the electricity, increase the capacity, and increases the life of the cells as well as to reduce and possibly eliminate pollutants. And we are now working with everyone on this, meaning governments as well as companies; and we\u2019re very excited about it. A question that was asked \u2013 I was asked about four questions ago was, \u201cAre we going to tighten our belts on SG&A and that sort of thing?\u201d And Michael Kraft said, \u201cWell, in some areas, of course, we will on some of these newer operations.\u201d I\u2019ll tell you where we won\u2019t. We won\u2019t in the research going into this new exciting program. This could be Ceradyne in five or ten years with the space of armor that we have, and it\u2019s an exciting area. We have a very proprietary product. And before we went down the continued questioning on the body armor, which is appropriate, was even though it\u2019s less, it\u2019s still going to be 40% of our shipments next year. Don\u2019t lose sight of these other programs. That\u2019s the end of my monologue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gary Liebowitz from Wachovia. Your line is open.\nGary Liebowitz \u2013 Wachovia: Thanks again. It sounds like there\u2019s been some downward average selling price pressure on XSAPI because of the multiple re-bids. Can you tell any, on the cost side, how does the cost structure for XSAPI compare to that of ESAPI?\nJoel Moskowitz:  Dave?\nDavid Reed: You know, Gary, the XSAPI project is very competitive right now. We\u2019re going to see some maybe a potential to re-bid, so we\u2019re going to keep pretty quiet on that. But it\u2019s a new ceramic material, it\u2019s a little less expensive to make than the past ceramic we were making so we feel pretty good about our cost position there. We\u2019re okay.\nGary Liebowitz \u2013 Wachovia: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Peter Karr [ph], a private investor. Your line is open.\nPeter Karr: Yes, my original question was about the stock buyback which you touched on and obviously, you\u2019re enthused with that thought process. Are you going to commit any more money in addition to the $65 million to the buyback?\nJoel Moskowitz: I can\u2019t answer that just yet. It\u2019s a good question. Let\u2019s see what happens to the price of the stock, and we\u2019re a very pragmatic company. For a long time, we resisted pressure to buyback the stock because we felt that our money could be better utilized in acquisitions or indeed the expansion. I\u2019m still of a mode, thankfully, that if we see opportunities and we can get deals on some of these potential acquisitions and we\u2019re going to just do that. In the stocks in this neighborhood, we can\u2019t help but be a buyer.\nPeter Karr: And just a small quick follow-up. The increasing value of the American dollar, how will that affect your company and will have an effect because it\u2019s rapidly gaining against the Canadian dollar?\nJoel Moskowitz: Well, regarding Canada, right now it\u2019s insignificant. Our business out of Ceradyne Canada isn\u2019t that big a deal. Eventually, Jerry, we have a very clear program on that. What\u2019s more important to us, of course, is the Euro versus the dollar because we\u2019re having \u2013 25% of our business is being sold in Euros and with the Euro against the dollar, I haven\u2019t looked at it lately, but it\u2019s $1.25 or so. That\u2019s actually in our \u2013 it\u2019s helping us.\nPeter Karr: Thank you.\nJerry Pellizzon: Yes, I think, Peter, the question is that the downward value of the Europe with a strength of its own is going to help ESK. And to give you an idea on the stock buyback, we have to take that up, obviously, with our board. But here\u2019s a thought, that if we actually queued on \u201909, we\u2019ll have $315 million in the bank; and if we pay off the convertible debt, that\u2019ll leave us $200 million. That will be $7.5 of pure cash on all of our stock in $17. It seems like that for \u2013 it\u2019s a pretty compelling story.\nJoel Moskowitz: I think that wraps it up, Mindy.

Welcome to Ceradyne 2008 second quarter results conference call. (Operator Instructions). Hosting Ceradyne call today is Joel Moskowitz, the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who is accompanied by Jerry Pellizzon, Chief Financial Officer; David Reed, President of North America Operations; Marc King, President of Ceradyne Armor Systems; and Michael Kraft, Vice President of Nuclear, Semiconductor Business Units, and Cary Okawa, Corporate Controller of Ceradyne. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Moskowitz, the company has requested that I read the following statement. The matters discussed in the conference call may include forward-looking statements regarding future events and future performance of Ceradyne that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Moskowitz. Please go ahead, sir.\nJoel Moskowitz: Good morning everybody. I am certainly glad that you could join us for the second quarter and six months, 2008, financial results. As [Simarian] just said regarding our Safe Harbor statement, the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's Annual Report on the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'd also like to remind you that a recording is being made of this conference call. Earlier today which has been our protocol for quite a while now, before the open of the market, we released the following press release. What I'll do is I'll review this, what we said, and then I am going to turn it over to Jerry Pellizzon for a few minutes to give you some further details on the financial aspects of things. And then we'll open it to Q&A. When we came in this morning, most of us were in pretty early. We had a problem with our servers being down for Internet and for our e-mails. And in case there is a break in these communications, we have arranged for an alternative phone call. Hopefully, we'll be able to get through to the call without any technical difficulties. We put out the release today and we stated that our sales in the second quarter, just ended, were $185 million, that was down slightly from $185.4 million in the second quarter last year. Our net income for the second quarter in 2008 had decreased to $33.2 million or $1.25 per diluted share. That compared to $38.3 million or $1.38 per fully diluted share last year in the second quarter of '07. Fully diluted average shares outstanding this year '08, were 26,539,000. That was lower than last year, 27,000,786 for the same period. The lower average shares outstanding currently is due primarily to the repurchase of approximately 1,128,000 shares under the company's stock repurchase program, which we announced on March 4; 2008. Our gross profit margins, based on a percentage of sales, were 40.8% for the second quarter, now that compared to 41.7% in the second quarter last year. Our provision for income taxes was 36.3% in Q2, '08, that compared to 35.9% last year for the second quarter. Now looking at the six months ending June 30th, our sales were $373.5 million, that was down slightly from the $373.8 million in the same period last year. Our net income for the first six months of '08 was ($66.1 million or $2.45 17:08) for fully diluted share, that was on 26,984,000 shares. Now that was down from last year, which was $76.4 million, or $2.77 for fully diluted share on increased shares a year ago of 27,585,000. The gross margins for the six months in '08 was 39.4% of net sales, that compared to 41.3% for the same period six months of 2007. And a provision for income taxes was 36.3% in the first six months of '08, that compared to 36% same period last year. Our new orders, new bookings for the second quarter of '08 were $145.4 million, that was up when compared to $55.3 million for the same period last year. And for the six months, new bookings were $357.3 million, that was also up compared to last years $231.7 million for the same period. Our ending backlog as of June 30, 2008, was $223.3 million that compared to last year, June 30, 2007 of $202.4 million. Now the press release went on to have a quote for myself, pointing out that in the first half we continued to implement our strategy, which is of global diversification in markets and products, while continuing our commitment to lightweight ceramic personnel armor, as well as what we perceive as an emerging vehicle armor requirement. And we went on to state some of the events that occurred in the last quarter, and which support that statement. First, we announced on June 6 that we had acquired a new technology, at least new for Ceradyne, in oil drilling bearing intellectual property and patents, which has to do with a proprietary technical ceramic bearing solution for down whole oil drilling. This technology utilizes silicon carbide advanced technical ceramics which are produced by the company's German subsidiary, ESK Ceramics. We also stated that we've hired one of the investors of this new product line, Russell Ide, Jr. who has now joined Ceradyne. The second point is that, we reiterated that on July 9, 2008, Ceradyne announced that it had signed a definitive agreement and plan of merger to acquire SemEquip Incorporated, who are in North Billerica, Massachusetts. Now that deal is anticipated to be completed sometime in August, it's pending SemEquip shareholder approval. SemEquip is a leader in the development of what are known as cluster ion implantation sub-systems for semiconductors and advanced ion sourced chemicals for the manufacture of logic and memory chips. This includes a particular molecule which is known as a cluster boron. For those interested in the chemistry of it, it's B18, 18 boron atoms and 22 hydrogen atoms, and maybe later on we can talk a little bit about what does all that means. And that, the B part of that, the boron, we'll use our enriched boron isotope which is known as 11B. The interesting thing about it is that we are the ones who make 11B, in our Quapaw, Oklahoma operation known as Ceradyne boron products. So when this deal is done we are probably going to have a teleconference dedicated solely on explaining what this company is and why we did this deal. Thirdly, we've now signed an agreement to acquire in China, not so far from our current facilities in Tianjin, an additional 13.7 acres of land, and we're going to build out a very large facility on that, it will about 330,000 square feet. Initially about half of it will be for the solar ceramic crucibles which I believe everyone is familiar with that we're making for the manufacture of photovoltaic, polycrystalline silicon solar cells. We will probably begin building this later this year, and we don't anticipate it will be up and running until sometime probably in the third quarter of 2009. On the press release, we went further on repeating our guidance and then modifying it. We repeated that in February 26th, and again in April 25th, we had provided a wide range of guidance of $715 million to $836 million of sales, and earnings range from $4.55 to $5.05. And we explained that the reason for this large range was that at the time we were working on delivering the BULL which is now referred to as MRAP II combat vehicles we had gotten an order for those, and as well as we had just submitted our proposal on the XSAPI/ESAPI which is the body armor. And so we determined that if we had no BULL, we would be at the lower end of the range. And at the high end of the range it includes everything in the lower end of the range which included XSAPI and anticipation of an XSAPI order which we still do not have, although you will see that we do anticipate that we will receive one, as I go on through the rest of this review. And the higher end included everything, and included some portion of our orders. However, we now have recently received information on both the XSAPI/ESAPI five-year proposal, as well as, the MRAP II BULL testing status. Based on that information we're able to provide you the following revised guidance. First of all, based on information we believe to be accurate, Ceradyne has qualified both its ESAPI, as well its XSAPI lightweight ceramic body armor systems for the upcoming ID/IQ (indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity) five-year procurement. In anticipation of an award this quarter, we are planning to ship product in Q4 '08 and those numbers are included in our projections. Secondly, based on informal input regarding testing of the Team BULL MRAP II, remember that's a Team of Ceradyne Oshkosh Truck and Ideal Innovations, we believe we have successfully passed the most critical ballistic survivability and mobility requirements. We also continue to believe that the BULL's anti-EFP, Explosively Formed Penetrator performance plus its independent suspension providing offroad requirement result in a combat vehicle that may be suited for specific theatres. However, based on shifting requirements, we also now believe the government currently plans to purchase the smaller, more mobile MRAPs, and so therefore, we do not believe it will be a significant 2008 BULL delivery order against the current ID/IQ contract. Therefore, we have modified in our revised guidance without a top end that assumes that we are not going to be making any BULL deliveries in 2008. When you put those numbers together, plus the fact that we had better than expected first half 2008 performance, we ended up with the following guidance for all of 2008. Sales now are $740 million to $750 million, with an earnings range projected to go from $4.70 to $4.80 per diluted share. At one point, when we put out the initial announcement on the signing of the agreement to acquire SemEquip, you may recall that we stated that we would have to take a charge of between $9 million and $11 million pre-tax assuming that the SemEquip deal closes in the third quarter, and the numbers that I stated above the revised guidance does not include that particular charge. That concludes my reviewing what I hope all of you already have, and I think maybe Jerry would like to make some comments on some of the financial aspects of Q2 in the six months. Jerry?\nJerry Pellizzon: Thank you, Joel. Good morning everybody. As a note we filed our 10-Q for the second quarter very early this morning with the SEC, so it's www.sec.gov, you can review a copy of that. The revenue diversification trend that began in Q3 2007, continued into this quarter and of course, into the first half of the year, and that trend is that the percentage of our total revenue from defense is declining and has been replaced with more sales from the industrial and automotive diesel sectors of our business due to both, organic growth and acquisitions that we made in 2007. For example, for the first six months of 2008, the percentage of revenue from defense declined to 63% of revenues, while it was actually 77.3% of revenues compared with the same period in 2007. With sales as Joel mentioned, just about flat during the two periods. Essentially the results of the first half of 2008 reflect that a large decline in body armor revenue of $61.4 million was just about fully offset by a combination of organic revenue growth and revenue from acquisitions. Revenue contributed by our two acquisitions completed in the third quarter of 2007, namely Minco and Boron products, contributed $25.3 million of sales for the first six months of 2008. While organic growth which are originating from sales of ceramic crucibles used for melting silicon and the manufacturing photovoltaic cells increased by about $15 million in the first six months of 2008 compared to 2007, which was about $3 million. Of that $15 million, $11 million came from our new manufacturing facility in Tianjin, China which opened in June of 2007. The other notable increases in organic growth were the ESK's industrial sales increased by $10.4 million. Our vehicle armor sales increased by $4.5 million during the six months. Our automotive sales increased by $4.2 million. And sales to the nuclear industry increased by $3 million. So even though income from operations declined by $14.3 million over the two periods, we delivered a very healthy 26.9% operating margin and our annualized pre-tax return on capital was slightly above 26%. So, not so bad. There is the fact that the SG&A expenses related to the incremental revenue are generally higher than those attributable to body armor. So, we are not quite able to replace body armor revenue dollar for dollar in terms of equivalent profit margins. In general, the results of the first six months of '08 reflect our strategy of expanding our business through internal growth and strategic acquisitions. For some numbers, free cash flow which is defined as net income plus depreciation and amortization less CapEx and including the impact of working capital amounted to $55.6 million for the first six months of '08 compared to $49 million in the comparable period last year. EBITDA, earnings before income, interest taxes, depreciation and amortization for the six months ended June 30, 2008, was $119.7 million compared to $128 million during the same period last year. I note depreciation for the period, this six-month period, was $18 million compared to $10.7 million for the same period last year. Our CapEx amounted to $27.6 million. We'll spend about $50 million to $55 million for the year. And that $27.6 for the first six months compared to $15.5 million in the comparable period last year. As far as internally generated working capital and collecting our cash, our DSOs are 33 days, compared to 32 days. So we are still very low on that basis also. Joel?\nJoel Moskowitz:  Thanks, Jerry. And now as we've done in the past, I hope everybody can hear us because we are getting some feedback here. But, we'll somehow get through this. We are going to go right into the Q&A period.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions). And your first question will go through the line of Pierre Maccagno.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham & Company& Company:  Good morning Joel, Jerry, David and Mike. Congratulations on the quarter. You came out above consensus.\nJoel Moskowitz: Thank you, Pierre.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham & Company: So, I wanted to do ask you about the XSAPI. Now what type of run rate are you expecting at this point starting in the fourth quarter? And also do you expect this to ramp up from the fourth quarter into 2009?\nJoel Moskowitz: I'll let Dave who is on top of all these aspects take that question.\nDavid Reed: Good morning, Pierre.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham & Company: Good morning.\nDavid Reed : We don't really know what the rate will be. The government has been a little slower than we thought in getting the award out. We are still hopeful that they will make awards in the August time period. We put in our plan, the numbers that have been presented, 12,000 sets per month for the fourth quarter of this year. And we don't have a plan for significant growth from that in '08 at this point. So, we're looking at '09 to be flat at that number right now. But, we'll know a lot more in about five weeks.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham & Company: Are you assuming with that about a 50% market share or do you think that the market itself comes down a little bit?\nDavid Reed : Well, we don't know for sure. We've heard that the government will look initially to field XSAPI for the theatre forces and depending how long they choose to do that their run rate could be anywhere between 15,000 sets all the way to 25,000 sets per month. So we're targeting about somewhere in the high-teens with us getting 12 of it. So yeah, that's kind of a close estimate.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham & Company: Okay. So there could be some upside I mean, if the government comes in?\nDavid Reed : It's possible.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham & Company: Okay. And then, some clarification on the BORONEIGE here in the note you say about your comment, the government is planning to purchase more mobile MRAPs. So, would you be able to supply these smaller MRAPs or would it be a competitor?\nJoel Moskowitz : Well, I'll let Marc handle that question since he came in from Washington. Marc?\nMarc King: Hey, good morning, Pierre.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham & Company: Hi.\nMarc King : The situation on MRAPs is changing almost on a daily basis now. Because of a shift in mission priorities and requirements as I'm sure you are aware from news reporting, the shift to an emphasis in the theatre in Afghanistan is asking for smaller, more mobile MRAPs. At the current time, there are some smaller ones within the current series of MRAPs that the government has been purchasing but even those don't really meet the theatre requirements that are being asked for currently at the theatre. There are some initiatives underway to acquire, test and possibly deploy other solutions that would better be suited for the type of terrain that's encountered in Afghanistan specifically. I can't give you details because of ongoing agreements not to disclose too much information. However, I can tell you that we'd be recalcitrant if we weren't participating in those types of initiatives at this point in time, we are doing that. Hopefully, we'll have more information for you later.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham & Company: Okay. If that was the case in all your work on the current model, would that be of any use or --?\nMarc King : I would submit to you that the BULL as it was tested currently met or exceeded all of the requirements for the MRAP II specification as it was issued by the government. That information is on file with the government. They have validated everything that they went out to look for in the initial MRAP II requirements. Now as always, that was one year ago, the shifting situation, both tactically and strategically for the war has caused them to have to shift some of their priorities. However, even though we are not anticipating a BULL purchase immediately because they now have a fully tested and certified solution, and we hold a $12.5 billion ID/IQ five-year contract. The contract has not been terminated, the contract remains open and the department has the option at any point in time of executing another delivery order against that contract. So at this point, we don't think they will place an order, but they can come at any time and say, we have a new requirement that looks for this type of vehicle. In addition to that, there has been some international interest in the vehicle that continues to be developed as a market opportunity.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham & Company: Okay, thanks for the clarification. And just my last question, gross margins for the fourth quarter were up and what drove that?\nJerry Pellizzon:  We had some productivity increases that came through Pierre during the quarter, enhancements in some of our manufacturing units. And we had a slightly different product mix that also helped us.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham & Company: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And your next question will go through the line of Al Kaschalk.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan Securities: Good morning, guys.\nJoel Moskowitz: Hi, Al.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan Securities: Real strong execution there on the margin front which is where I'd like to maybe start with my first question. Are you seeing any pressure from the military side of the business for ASPs or what has traditionally been around the 40% level on the gross margin side?\nJoel Moskowitz: Well, I'll take that. First, we don't want to get into the specifics because we have not gotten a contract yet on the XSAPI/ESAPI. These are always fixed price contracts. Our margins are a little bit higher with total because remember, we are completely vertical integrated. And at least to-date and we anticipate as we go forward, no one makes the ceramic as well as the total system. So I don't want to go into too much specifics.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan Securities: Sure, Joel my question --\nJoel Moskowitz: If there are pressures, they are brought on by ourselves looking to get a bigger piece of the action.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan Securities: Sure. Let me try to restate my question. The consolidated margins were very strong in the quarter gross, and one would think as you're diversifying away from a vertically integrated business and rolling in a couple of other acquisitions that may not have the revenue ramp yet, but could arguably be a little bit better margin business that would have dipped a little bit. So I'm just trying to square up my assumptions or expectations relative to the very good execution on the quarter.\nJoel Moskowitz: Well, we have some exceptional margins as you know in the solar area.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan Securities: Yeah.\nJoel Moskowitz: And that's covering an awful lot. The other areas, remember we expect the margin decrease as vehicles become more important but they haven't yet, so you don't see that yet. And I would say that the total package, even though we don't break it out is being influenced strongly by the surge in crucibles. And whether that continues or not, we'll have to see we're putting in an awful big facility in China. In anticipation, we're also worried about the supply of silicon metal going forward for our customers. Even though if you read the reports on it, it's going to be probably go maybe from a huge imbalance with demand exceed supply, and then if everybody confess we're going to make silicon which is not us, comes on-stream that should be cured within the next six to eight months.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan Securities: Following on the previous question on production rates, ESAPI, are you still at the same level you were? Do you see any changes there over the next six to 12 months?\nJerry Pellizzon: That's a little uncertain, Al. We have orders that roughly the 25,000 sets per month through the end of November right now. The army has not made it clear how much longer they will run at that rate and when they will switch over to an X-version of that. So, hopefully they will give a little bit more insight into that in the next couple of months.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan Securities: This is similar to ESAPI/XSAPI, it's potentially or likely it could be a transition, but we'll get some additional data points down the road from here.\nJerry Pellizzon: Well its likely there will be a transition because in the past they have never allowed the soldier to have one level of protection on the chest and back and a lesser level on the side. So, we expected that would go to one level of protection.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan Securities: Okay. Joel, and maybe this is more for Marc as well, but in terms of shift in mission in terms of Afghanistan versus Iraq, would you characterize that as a more of a positive or less or is it neutral in terms of the impact on your business or potential business on the vehicle side?\nMarc King: Well, at this point I would submit to you that right at this point it's probably a neutral with a tendency toward a positive because of an opportunity to introduce some additional vehicle designs that hadn't been considered previously. We are working through those opportunities now. Again, it will become clearer to us as the tactical mission expands in the Afghan theatre. The commanders will provide feedback to the various organizations in the United States that look at acquiring this type of equipment. That feedback will be fed out to the contractors, the contractors will respond. We are in that loop and we'll have an opportunity to provide solutions that we think meet the commander's needs in the field. So it's another new opportunity to look at something slightly different than what was going on in Iraq. The mission is different, the frame is different, and the threat is slightly different. So it goes from a neutral to a positive as we continue to expand that mission.\nJoel Moskowitz: Yeah, the one thing Al you may have read is that, the roads in Afghanistan particularly are in terrible condition. And the one, I've always felt that the partnership with Oshkosh with the MTVR chassis really gave us a leg up, because it has six wheels, it has independent suspension. And being on road is like being off road in Afghanistan. That remains to be seen, what that will mean, but you do know there have been issues of the smaller MRAPs having accidents. Even in Iraq there is a lot of information on the Internet on that where some Americans have been killed actually by being trapped with the rollovers. So who knows? It certainly has to be looked at. As Marc said, it's an opportunity. If they need more off road, see the current MRAP spec, it's not for significant off road capabilities even though we provided it with our BULL, a vehicle.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan Securities: So, I guess that the takeaway here for all of us is that luckily successful testing, you haven't been disqualified, there is an ID/IQ contract, its five years, and the opportunity still presents itself that you could win something?\nJoel Moskowitz: That's exactly correct.\nDavid Reed: And for the sake of our projections, for now we're not putting any numbers in.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan Securities: That's great. Thank you very much.\nJoel Moskowitz: Sure.\nOperator: And your next question will go through the line of Gary Liebowitz.\nGary Liebowitz - Wachovia Securities: Good morning, gentlemen.\nJoel Moskowitz: Hi, Gary.\nGary Liebowitz - Wachovia Securities: Hi. Joel, can you just maybe follow-up on a prior question about the margins in the ACO segment. They are up 200 basis points from the first quarter and from the fourth quarter of '07 on lower volume. And you talked about some productivity improvements. Can you give us some color on that? And where you think margins are going in that business for the rest of the year on the lower volume?\nJoel Moskowitz: Let David tackle that, it's just all under his responsibility.\nDavid Reed: Well, I think the best way to look at that Gary is that we've got a great team on the manufacturing side. Ken Morris and his crowd in the armor side have just continued to lean out the operations both in hot press and assembly. So, even though the volume has dropped with some of the stretch out on body armor, we've been able to improve the yields in both of those operations and to take out some of the costs associated with some of the raw materials and also with some of the support products that go in there. So, that's been great. And on the other side, Bruce Lockhart and his team in thermal materials have just done fantastic on the crucibles. And again, have brought out some of the cost and the new facility in China was laid out to perfection the way we want it to always be, and they've just streamlined that. So, those two have been the major contributors to that improvement.\nGary Liebowitz - Wachovia Securities: Okay. And your second half outlook for ACO, I mean, could you sustain these mid-30s margins as you do this transition?\nDavid Reed: Well, I certainly hope so. The XSAPI effort is always a new product. It brings a lot of uncertainty with it. But, as I said we have a excellent team, we've had quite a bit of time to work on the hot pressing of the ceramic for the XSAPI, we feel pretty good about that. But I am also a realist; there is always issues with start up. So, I think we'll be able to keep in the range we just discussed.\nGary Liebowitz - Wachovia Securities: Okay. And then one for Joel if I may, Joel can you talk about your cash deployment priorities; it looks like during the quarter you really slow down the share buybacks for next to nothing in the month of June. How are you weighing buybacks now versus other opportunities such as acquisitions?\nJoel Moskowitz: Well, you are correct in your observations. We didn't buy very much back as the stock started getting up to 40 and now it's over 40. So we still have, as you could see from the balance sheet, close to a $0.25 billion in cash and near cash. We're evaluating that. It's not the highest priority as we start moving up in stock price. We are committed to the SemiEquip deal and that we'll use on closing a little bit more than $25 million. And then we're going to be expanding our facilities to make the B18H22, we're going to put in what I hope will be the most modern facility for making semiconductor chemicals. We are going to do that in Quapaw, Oklahoma. And last time, I think I'd kind of mentioned that we were looking at a number of acquisitions. I referred to one small one, and kind of that was the acquisition of the Drilling Bearings, I referred to one that was the kind of a medium for Ceradyne which is SemiEquip, which is not done, but we anticipate it will. And I referred to a larger one which I didn't refer to again this time, we're still working on it. That would use a good part of our cash if it materialized, which would probably not be clear till the end of the year. So, our general feeling is we started keeping our powder dry. Jerry has been right on the mark as far as generating close to $10 million a month, and we are very pragmatic. We like right now, look to people are bringing us deals, the prices are getting a little softer, cash talks and we have cash, and I would say that we're still looking for acquisitions. If I had to determine the different options for cash it would be through acquisitions and expansions.\nGary Liebowitz - Wachovia Securities: Thank you, it's very helpful.\nJoel Moskowitz: You're welcome.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions). And your next question will go to the line of Josephine Millward.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group Company: Good morning, everybody.\nJoel Moskowitz: Good morning, Josephine.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group Company: Great quarter. Can you give us a little more color on what's contributing to the $25 million increase in the lower end of your guidance? Is it more certainty from XSAPI or other areas of business are doing better than you expected?\nJoel Moskowitz: As I said, the first half we consider to really be good, really solid. I mean we didn't have any real numbers from vehicles, the BULL was all in testing, and R&D, and yet our numbers were higher than we had projected. And so, if you take our first half and flip it, assume we'll do about the second half, you are sort of in the same ballpark as we are. And so, the heart of the increase was simply that we really did better. You could see that our bookings were higher in a lot of areas. We don't go into such minor detail, but we had in Germany, they are doing much more now in the silicon carbide seals and bushings. For plane old, they wouldn't want me to call a plane old but it's a very mature product market for fluid handling, and we've been recognized now in Europe by the biggest suppliers as the number one vendor. And we're expanding our facility in Bazet, France, which is a little operation that wasn't doing all that well and now they are doing much better. We expect them to be profitable for the year as recently as last week we increased our CapEx on diamond machining. And so we are very pleased with that. And we might have gone up higher but what they said is so. We haven't made a lot of XSAPI, except for prototypes and the submission of the first article and all of that. And so if we're counting on our shot in the Q4, we want to be a little more comfortable that we'll have the same kind of good yields that we're having now. So the increase as you correctly stated is simply, primarily based on our performance in the first half.\nJerry Pellizzon:  Let me just give you a little more color on some other units. Thermo itself outperformed our plan, both here domestically and in China. We also had Canada that did well as opposed to last year where they were struggling a bit. And even though we had such a decline in body armor revenue, I think the points that Dave indicated contributed to maintaining our margins there. And so those three also contributed besides the things that Joel mentioned.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group Company:  Great. So mostly from a better than expected first half, that gives you more confidence for Q2 at similar run rates in the second half?\nJerry Pellizzon: Yeah, that's the way you should look at it.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group Company:  Okay. Hey, this might be a question for Dave and Marc, I'm hearing that the Army might do a combination XSAPI and lighter ESAPI buying. If that's how it plays out, how do you think that might impact your body armor business going forward? How would that change your 12,000 sets a month assumption for XSAPI?\nDavid Reed: I haven't heard that Josephine in terms of a lighter. Do you mean as a proportion of the buy?\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group Company:  Right. I mean, I know it probably hasn't been decided yet but my understanding is the Army might be contemplating a combination buy. So possibly an improved version of the XSAPI and improved version of the ESAPI, just trying to get your take on how that would play out if they were to move forward with that?\nDavid Reed: Well, that won't play out at all because in the solicitation they only asked for a regular ESAPI and XSAPI. So whatever people qualify, it is what they will looking for. They could always come out once they make awards and ask for engineering change proposals, but they did not ask for in the solicitation nor were they provided bids for an improved or lighter version of the ESAPI. And I think their emphasis really is to get the improved level of protection from the XSAPI, not necessarily a lighter ESAPI because that wouldn't address the new threat in the battlefield.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group Company:  Okay. So you think it's going to be a purely XSAPI buy?\nDavid Reed: Well, there may be some trailing ESAPI awards for that transition period, I don't know what their total requirement is. But I think the long-term play is for the XSAPI. \nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group Company:  Great, thanks for that. And I know I'm running out of time, but if you could give us an update on the solar businesses and when you expect the new oil drilling technology to contribute to your revenues in the future? Thank you.\nJerry Pellizzon: I'll take that. Actually, to tell you the truth I read the prospectus from GT Solar, the company that make the furnaces. And the reason they went public yesterday, the reason that's of interest to us is that there are leader in this field and we have to design our crucibles to fit into their furnaces. And what I like, I found very interesting was in all their words they quoted their markets for polysilicon, it's having grown 47% a year, and very high percentage of that in the poly, they also in their risk factors clearly pointed out the same thing that I said earlier. There has got to be more silicon coming on-stream, now we expect that. The giants like Volker and Hemlock and others have announced it and a lot of smaller companies have announced it. And so if even half of those people come through that won't be an issue. So we are building the new factory. Remember, the numbers are this; we have about 100,000 feet now in Tianjin. I just said we're going to put in 330,000 square feet which is a triple, although only about half of that will be for the crucibles and we're doing a lot of work in Atlanta. So I don't want to go into a lot of details because we don't break that out separately per say, its part of Ceradyne thermo materials. I have a concern in the short run regarding silicon, but so far so good. And even this IPO yesterday, although it doesn't affect Ceradyne Inc. particularly, half of their future business looks like the new equipment to make silicon, not to make the silicon starting material, not to make the Poly. So I'm very up on solar and all the data now keeps coming out more and more and more and more that the prices will be going down, not because of us, but because of the price of silicon. Regarding oil, I've spent personally, a lot of time now, in the last eight weeks in Canada and its enormous what's going on. Ceradyne had a exhibit in Calgary, I think a week or so ago. It's called the Oil Sands conference. And they gave a lecture there. So they need 100,000 rough nets up in the Alberta province, to me and the materials, they expect to triple their output of oil up to, I think 3 million to 4 million barrels a day over the next 15 to 20 years. Hopefully, we'll play a very important role. Right now our work on the gas end, I mean the oil's end is minimal. But we think by the end of next year, we'll go from less than a few million dollars a year to tens of millions of dollars run rate at the end of '09. And we're prepared to do that, most of the product coming out of our Lexington, Kentucky facility. Regarding the new acquisitions, that's very speculative, our sales are very well now less than $1 million. The product is phenomenal. Ask me that question, Josephine, in about, maybe even the next quarter and I'll give you a better answer.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group Company: Great, thank you.\nOperator:  And your next question will go through the line of Michael French.\nMichael French - Morgan Joseph & Co. Inc:  Good morning, gentlemen.\nJoel Moskowitz: Good morning, Michael.\nMichael French - Morgan Joseph & Co. Inc: Congratulations on a great quarter. \nJoel Moskowitz: Thanks.\nMichael French - Morgan Joseph & Co. Inc: First question, can you address, I guess this is for Marc, specifically how RAMTECH might be impacted by changes in mission requirements. As they look at the long-term armor strategy, how this is going to fit in?\nMarc King: Good morning, Mike. Actually on our L pass armor designs and the incorporation of our RAMTECH technology, there really is no direct impact. I can tell you that in about 45 days we'll deliver our first set of armor that is designed of our L pass materials. Now that will go to a major OEM and begin immediately being tested at the army's test center as part of an overall test of vehicle capabilities, the armor being an intricle component in that test to test its durability over the long period of time. The materials are also now being used in a number of other variations. For testing, it's been looked at by a number of OEMs for testing, and also was recently used in some test evaluated viability as part of the emerging JLTV program for one of the OEMs that defined for that program. That testing went very well and we had no reason to anticipate anything else because of the prior testing of it. But, they wanted to test it again and found that it performed extremely well. So we are very optimistic that our armor development efforts in the area of lightweight composite armors is moving ahead quiet nicely, and a derivative coming off that is additional lightweight armor systems used in test now with ARL, our chief scientist is busily at work with ARL in a cooperative research and development agreement to try and bring online even lighter, more effective solutions for some of the most lethal threats on the battlefield. He's been up there for over a week now testing materials. And again, we received some very positive results back but we're still mostly testing materials, we are moving ahead with some of the OEMs, again in the secrecy agreements that we have with these folks prevent me from going into anymore detail. I know you'd like to have the detail but unfortunately, I'm kind of constrained at this point because of competitive issues that the OEMs don't want to discuss. But they are turning this material into product now, applying it on vehicle systems, and they are using it in testing for the army customer and for the marine core customer. So we are moving very rapidly in the right direction. We just need to have again some patience to see how things test out now. All of this again is being done in the competitive environment. They are looking at other choices and solutions about where we had the opportunity to go head-to-head with other solutions, we have managed to emerge on top and very gratified by the results both of our armor development and our vehicle design team back in Western Michigan who has done an outstanding job in incorporating this material into a usable design that the OEMs can then apply. I hope that answers your question.\nMichael French - Morgan Joseph & Co. Inc: Yes, it does. It sounds like its progressing well, thank you. And, next one on the BULL, the outstanding contract that's out there, it's a five-year. What does that create for you in the way of obligations because (inaudible) you have to deliver if the two years from now show up in an order?\nMarc King :  Yes, you're correct. It does create an obligation for us that leaves us in a position to be prepared at any point in time to start a production effort for the BULL. We are aware of that. We will hold that contingency in our hip pocket. Once as you know what the assignment of the ID/IQ contract, also came a DX rating for that contract. So, if we had to get into the materials acquisition mode very quickly, we have the advantage of a DX rated contract now which we didn't have prior to the award of that contract which gives us a very high priority to the acquisition of materials which we could do on a very expedited basis with our team partners, Oshkosh Truck and Ideal Innovations understand the implications of this. And again, we'll just sit by here and wait and see what the customer wants to do. Anybody with any BOD experience in their background knows that this situation could change at any point in time. They can come back. We know for a fact that they liked what they saw with the BULL, they've even cherry picked some of the system designs that we incorporated into the BULL that are being used to improve some of the existing MRAPs already deployed into the field. But, that's a normal course for them to do after doing the extensive testing that they did on the BULL, and it might add the BULL has probably been tested more than any other MRAP system that they've acquired to-date. It never exceeded each and every one of their expectations. There were some design changes conducted during the testing. Each of those changes has been applied. And I could add at this point that there is even discussion about doing some additional testing to make sure that the design package is fully validated sitting on the shelf and ready to go, so that if the commanders decide that this is something they want, we're ready to start producing in a moments notice, and no further testing would be required at that time.\nMichael French - Morgan Joseph & Co. Inc: Okay. And just a quick one on the XSAPI. Dave, I think you mentioned that you're expecting at least the initial order to look at volumes that would cover the theatre and the if run rate you are talking about they could fill that win a year or so. So, what are you expecting to hear from them in terms of total demand?\nDavid Reed : I think we'll just have to let that play out, Michael. I don't think anybody can make that prediction at this time. You know in the past whenever they've made a switch they have not wanted to have mixed inventory among all the active and reserve troops. So they've usually made the decision long-term to change into the most modern design. So, that's what we are hoping and expecting. But you never can tell that. So our initial goal is to get as much of the initial rollout of the product as we can, and then to work with the army to transition all of the army and marines over to that new design.\nMichael French - Morgan Joseph & Co. Inc: Okay, very good. Thank you, gentlemen, and good luck.\nOperator:  And your next question will go through the line of Jiwon Lee.\nJiwon Lee - Sidoti & Company: Good morning.\nJoel Moskowitz:  Good morning, Jiwon.\nJiwon Lee - Sidoti & Company: Thanks for clearing the air on the MRAP II front. My only question is on China. As much as you could, could you give us a little more color or your plan on your new China capacity that may not be tied to the BULL itself?\nJoel Moskowitz: Well, yes. We are already manufacturing a particular component for ultrasound equipment that uses user electric ceramic. And we're doing that in our current facility, and it's working out pretty well. And we are very seriously looking at moving some high volume more labor intensive components from Germany. I mentioned this whole product line of these fluid handling components and we're looking to put in the other half of the facility, ESK operations. We are also looking to expand, remember, when we bought Minco last year, we said we bought it because of our whole plan for vertical integration, namely we make the high purity fused silica powder in Tennessee and we ship it to Atlanta, and they make the product in Atlanta or they in turn ship it to China. We may not have focused that much on is that, that is not what mostly they do there. Mostly they make precision investment casting, ceramics for casting in the lost wax process of steel and aluminum. And the market in turn is huge, and we are participating in that almost insignificantly. And so we are thinking of putting a Minco operation fused silica in order to service not only solar, but also what we refer to as PIC, Precision Investment Casting.\nJiwon Lee - Sidoti & Company: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question will go through the line of Tim Quillin.\nTim Quillin - Stephens Inc.: Hi, good morning.\nJoel Moskowitz: Good morning, Tim.\nTim Quillin - Stephens Inc.: Just a question regarding guidance. It looks like in terms of revenue guidance, you're assuming that quarterly revenue is roughly flat with where you were in 2Q? And just with respect to XSAPI is the assumption that the XSAPI volumes merely replace current ESAPI production levels, and that overall body armor revenue is roughly the same as where you were in 2Q?\nJoel Moskowitz: Yeah, I think that's right, Tim. As I said, the side plate business we have is already booked solid through the end of November. We'll probably get releases in the fall to fill out the year and that's just one more month. And so we are looking at the ESAPI to be replaced by the XSAPI, at roughly the same kind of run rate we have now for ESAPI in the fourth quarter.\nTim Quillin - Stephens Inc.: Okay and just in terms of margin assumptions, so your EPS guidance presumes lower EPS in the second half of the year than you've had in the first half of the year which is really a function of lower margins and where would that come? Where would you think that you might have lower margins in the second half of the year than you've had in the first half? Thanks.\nJerry Pellizzon: Tim, we've made the assumption that we're going to have some start up issues that we'll have to work through in XSAPI. And that as the start up of any new major product line like that, we don't expect that it will run at the same margins as the very mature ESAPI program.\nTim Quillin - Stephens Inc.: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question will go through the line of Gib Dunham.\nGib Dunham: Good morning. I have two questions. The first, it relates just to the words I think of the SemEquip deal, you refer to the approval or needing the approval of shareholders and it's a private company, so I was just confused, what has to happen there and will there be any holdup or why would they need to approve it if it's a private company, I assume you already have that approval?\nJoel Moskowitz: I will let Michael handle that.\nMichael Kraft: Gib, hello, this is Michael. You're right, this is a privately-held company, but they do have several series of financing and those shareholders have to approve the merger. So it is a merger. It's an acquisition of assets and in that process there is a vote that typically takes 30 days and we anticipate that should close in the mid-August timeframe.\nGib Dunham: Okay. And then my second question relates to your non-military business. You were a little vague on giving guidance for the drilling revenue on opportunity going forward and for the solar opportunity, I'm sorry, the SemEquip opportunity going forward. The question is, what would your non-military business be as a percent of revenue at the end of '09 or maybe kind of a run rate level? \nJoel Moskowitz: Well, the only thing that we said in our last year is that our target is to have a 50-50 product mix, 50% defense and 50% non-defense, right now we're still about a 65%, 62% defense.\nGib Dunham: Right.\nJoel Moskowitz: So, sometime and our target for the 50-50 mix was 2010. That's where we stand now subject to whether we achieve that and subject to acquisitions.\nGib Dunham: Still, if I can connect the dots, it sounds like these two acquisitions will add maybe not meaningfully but somewhat to the company in the next 12 months?\nJoel Moskowitz: Yes.\nGib Dunham: Okay. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And your next question will go through the line of [Dan Mickelborough].\nDan Mickelborough: My questions most have been answered. Can you just let us know what the CapEx spending was for the first half of the year?\nJoel Moskowitz: Sure it was 27.6.\nDan Mickelborough: Okay, good quarter. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Okay. Next question will go through the line of Brent Reed.\nBrian Butler - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.: Hi, this is actually Brian Butler. How are you guys doing?\nJoel Moskowitz: Brian, how are you? \nBrian Butler - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.: Good, just one question to follow-up on the ESAPI. Is there going to be any ESAPI production in the fourth quarter that's outside I guess the army's requirements, only special forces or I guess it is not even ESAPI, but anything along the line of the SPEAR body armor, can you give us some sense to what that might be in the fourth quarter?\nJerry Pellizzon: Yeah, we have some continuing sales. We have an ongoing contract with Defense Supply Center, Philadelphia. So there is the opportunity for another release that would bring some of that order into the fourth quarter. And we have a large four-year contract with the special ops. They continue to make releases on that. So we expect to make some SPEAR plates and also some of the side plate program for the special ops. So, yeah, that's part of the mix. It's not nearly as large as the army portion of our business, but it's a significant plate for us and we expect those orders to come through, Brian.\nBrian Butler - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.: Thanks. \nJoel Moskowitz: Before we go to the next question because we keep getting additional people, we usually try to limit this to an hour. We'll go for anybody on the call now, we'll take and no additional ones Simarian.\nOperator: Okay. Right now you have six participants left in queue. You want to take all six?\nJoel Moskowitz: Yeah, we'll take six.\nOperator: Okay. Your next question will go to the line of [Peter Karr].\nPeter Karr: Yeah, just quickly, do you anticipate any future contribution from the nuclear waste containment items that you were anticipating producing?\nJoel Moskowitz: Michael?\nMichael Kraft: Hello Peter, this is Michael. Yes, we definitely expect to have future contributions. We do have a growth plan in nuclear, as you know it's a growing market, that's why we are putting some resources in that area. So, yeah, the answer is yes, we certainly see future contributions there.\nPeter Karr: Any timeframe?\nDavid Reed:  Well, it's contributing now Peter. It will continue to increase in the next two years. I think our two-year revenue plan is going to be at about 15 million two years out. So, it will continue to grow.\nPeter Karr: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. And the next question will go to Alan Robinson.\nAlan Robinson - RBC Capital Markets: Good morning. My question relates to the proposed SemEquip acquisition. I understand that the $25 million acquisition costs maybe increased by up to $100 million I guess in milestone payments. Can you give us an idea of the most likely timeline for these additional payments? Are they likely to be linear over the 15-year period or back or front-end loaded? Thanks.\nJerry Pellizzon: You should go back to the original release, Alan. It's all based on sales. There is a cap, I think of, what, 12 years?\nDavid Reed: About 15.5 to 16 years.\nJerry Pellizzon: So, it's all based on sales. They get a lot more in the front two years and then it goes down to 5.5% of sales until it gets to $125 million total or the numbers of years expire.\nAlan Robinson - RBC Capital Markets:  All right, I'll check that. Thank you.\nJerry Pellizzon: Sure.\nOperator: And the next question goes to [Larsh Schwartz].\nLarsh Schwartz: Hey Joel, congratulations, nice quarter.\nJoel Moskowitz: Thank you very much Larsh.\nLarsh Schwartz: One of the things that you haven't touched on at all which you did in your Annual Report is the opportunity in the aluminum. And over the last couple of years it seems to me that there has been a very, very large increase in the significance of carbon dioxide reduction, and I'm wondering if that's accelerating if you want to talk at all about what kind of reduction do you get in carbon dioxide by using the process that you're working on and any updates as far as timing?\nJoel Moskowitz: Briefly, aluminum continues to be very important to Ceradyne. This is the smelting of aluminum. The manufacture of aluminum from the mineral bauxite, where we anticipate that we'll be able replace carbon electrodes with our electrically conducted Titanium Diboride. Actually we shift several millions of dollars in the first half on that just on prototype. So it's gotten past hundreds of thousands of dollars. And I've said in our Annual Report the opportunity could be a $1 billion plus market, I still feel that way and we're continuing to work on it. The purpose of using titanium diboride to replace carbon is three-fold. First, you reduce the amount of electricity by as much as 20%. Second, you decrease the carbon dioxide emissions, and I'll get to the percentages in a minute. And thirdly, we believe although it's been too early that we will increase productivity, increase cell life. On the CO2, currently when you make aluminum you put out more carbon dioxide than you do aluminum. And this is a serious problem in today's world, particularly with the focus on greenhouse gases and global warming. So the answer to your question, Larsh, is not absolutely clear because it depends how much you substitute. The reason you get carbon dioxide is because the oxygen that comes off with the mineral grabs on to the carbon from the electrode. So if you change the electrode to titanium diboride, it goes from being a polluter to being a rainforest. You put out oxygen, not CO2. So there will be a reduction, whether it goes to zero or not depends on how much they use of ours and that gets into a little too much technology for this conversation.\nLarsh Schwartz: Okay, thank you very much.\nJoel Moskowitz: Okay, Larsh.\nOperator: Okay. And the next question go to the line of Ferat Ongoren.\nFerat Ongoren - Citigroup Global Markets: Hey, Joel.\nJoel Moskowitz : Hi, Ferat, how are you?\nFerat Ongoren - Citigroup Global Markets: Good, yourself?\nJoel Moskowitz : Okay, thank you.\nFerat Ongoren - Citigroup Global Markets: A quick one, maybe for Dave, given the delays we had on the ESAPI and XSAPI side, I mean, what's the visibility? You're talking about may be an August order. What's the visibility on that front? And then the second question is, as you kind of look at the forward quarter, third quarter, I mean is that going to be lighter than second quarter in terms of deliveries given, we don't have XSAPI yet?\nDavid Reed : I think the likelihood of the order is very strong now. The delay really was associated with the trying to allow everyone who wanted to participate both in the rigid version and the flexible version of XSAPI to give them the opportunity to do it and the shift to do testing at a government lab, ATC did the testing. So, those things combined to stretch out the program. The testing is all done for us. So that was the main hurdle to get through. Now it's really in the hands of the contracting officer, so they are just working with the army to put out their contracts to the people that have qualified. So I don't see any more reason to think that will delay. And as I said earlier, I think the second half will be very similar to the first half. We were stretched out and at a lower run rate of products for the army and we picked kind of that lower run rate for the fourth quarter. We're solid through the end of the third quarter at what we've been doing already. We've got most of the fourth quarter with the side plates filled up, and we have some other orders for special ops in Philadelphia that looks pretty solid. So really, it's just the timing on that XSAPI and we should know in about three, four weeks of how we are doing.\nFerat Ongoren - Citigroup Global Markets: Got it. And then, since you know the results of testing, are we going to have new players in the game or is that going to be kind of the competitors you had in the existing contract?\nJoel Moskowitz: I don't have any insight into that Ferat, I just know how we did.\nFerat Ongoren - Citigroup Global Markets: Got it. Okay. And a final one, maybe for Joel, what's the revenue impact of the SemEquip deal maybe for this year and then for '09? And thanks for the questions, thanks for the answers.\nJoel Moskowitz: Yeah, Michael?\nMichael Kraft: Well, Ferat, we're going to have a call after the close. As you know it's not an acquisition that we closed, so I really can't answer that question but we'll address that when we have a specific call probably in the mid-August timeframe.\nFerat Ongoren - Citigroup Global Markets: Got it, but it is in the guidance, right?\nJerry Pellizzon: It's not in the guidance, Ferat, this is Jerry.\nFerat Ongoren - Citigroup Global Markets: Okay, okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And your final question will go through the line of Don Littlewood.\nDon Littlewood - Littlewood Burke: Well, most of mine got answered here after I entered the queue. I do want to complement you though on the way you're expanding beyond the armor. It really is impressive and the vertical nature of it really makes everybody feel good.\nJoel Moskowitz: Thank you, Don.\nDon Littlewood: Okay, that's it. Thanks.\nJoel Moskowitz: All right. Okay. Simarian, let's wrap it up.\nOperator: Okay. You can go ahead with any closing remarks if you have any.\nJoel Moskowitz: No, I think this has been a lengthy Q&A.\nOperator: Okay.\nJoel Moskowitz: And I think that everybody has a pretty good stand though.. Now we just have to perform.\nOperator:  Okay. No problem. That does conclude today's conference call. At this time you may now all disconnect."}, {"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 1, "year": 2008, "date": "2008-04-25 16:57:08", "content": "Executives: Joel Moskowitz - Chairman, President and CEO Jerry Pellizzon - CFO and Corporate Secretary David Reed - VP and President of North American Operations Marc King - VP of Armor Operations\nAnalysts: Tim Quillin - Stephens Incorporated Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan Pierre Maccagno - Needham Jiwon Lee - Sidoti & Company Gary Liebowitz - Wachovia Josephine Millward - Stanford Group Avinash Kant - Broadpoint Capital Jason Simon - JMP Securities Michael French - Morgan Joseph Brian Butler - FBR Alex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder Don Littlewood - Littlewood Burke David Kaizer - Robotti & Company Dan Berkery - O'Connor\nOperator: Welcome to Ceradyne 2008 first quarter results conference call. This conference is being recorded today April 25, 2008 at the request of Ceradyne. All participants are currently in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. We request that participants limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to allow others on the call an opportunity to participate. Hosting Ceradyne's call today is Joel Moskowitz, the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who is accompanied by Jerry Pellizzon, Chief Financial Officer; David Reed, President of North America Operations; Marc King, President of Vehicle Armor Systems; and Michael Kraft, Vice President of Nuclear and Semiconductor Business Unit. Before I turn the call to Mr. Moskowitz, the company has requested that I read the following statements. The matters discussed in this conference call may include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future performance of Ceradyne that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Moskowitz. Please go ahead, sir.\nJoel Moskowitz: Thank you, Kara, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be here on another beautiful Southern California day to report on our first quarter 2008 financial results. In addition to the forward-looking-statement that Kara read, I'd like to also advice you that a recording is being made of this conference call. Earlier today, Ceradyne issued a press release including our financial results for the quarter ending March 31, 2008. I'll briefly review that with you for some of you who may not have seen the total release. Our sales for the first quarter were slightly ahead of the prior year. We shipped $188.5 million versus $188.4 million last year. Our net income, however, decreased 13.6% to $32.9 million or $1.20 per fully diluted share, and that compared to last year of $38.1 million or $1.38 per fully diluted shares. The average number of shares outstanding in Q1 '08 were 27.407 million, and that compared to 27.528 million last year for the same period. Our gross margin this year, Q1 2008, was 37.9% of net sales. That compares to last year in the same quarter 2007 of 40.9%. The provision for income taxes was 36.3% in Q1 '08. That compares to 36.1% last year in the same quarter. New orders in '08 for the first quarter were $211.8 million, and that compared to last year $176.5 million. Our ending backlog as of March 31, 2008 was $262.7 million, and that compared to $332.3 million last year March 31, 2007. During the first quarter of '08 we cited a few brief highlights. The first was the appointment of Tom Cole as a Vice President of Business Development. Tom is a long time semantic engineer and senior management. He was the President of Minco, the company that we bought on July 10, 2007. And we are very pleased to have Tom on board in this very important position as we go forward with several acquisitions, or at least the investigation of these opportunities. And I think that Tom will be a catalyst in moving the company forward this year on several acquisition opportunities. The second item that we mentioned was the continued strength for our high purity ceramics crucibles, which are used in the manufacture of polycrystalline silicon for photovoltaic solar cells. We had stated earlier that we're in the process and we are purchasing 12 additional acres pretty close to our current facility in Tianjin, and we shortly will begin constructing a new 200,000 square foot ceramic crucible manufacturing facility, which we anticipate will be open sometime early next year. I'd like to point out that that's in addition to the 98,000 square foot facility that we opened on June 20, 2007, and that will give us about 300,000 square feet in China in manufacturing. On March 4, 2008 we did announce the Ceradyne stock repurchase plan, and we've bought slightly over 1 million shares on that repurchase plan with an average price of about $30 a share. We went on to remind everyone that we had provided guidance on February 26 with a wide sales range from $715 million to $836 million for the total year and earnings also from $4.55 to $5.05 for fully diluted share. Based on our current new order rates, which I just cited above, and the backlog and the results that we reported today, we are pleased to reiterate the above guidance. I want to point out also that the guidance, which has a fairly large spread, is due to the potential magnitude of the BULL combat vehicle, as well as the five-year XSAPI/ESAPI proposal, neither of which has been awarded. We have provided the 2008 guidance, therefore, with an unusually wide range. The lower range reflects all of our current business units even though the multiyear XSAPI/ESAPI orders will not be issued before Q3 of 2008 but does not include any production orders for the BULL combat vehicle, while the higher end of the range includes the lower end, plus some production of the BULL combat vehicle in the second half of 2008. That effectively concludes my comments, which I have reiterated on the press release that we had put out before the market open. And I'm now going to ask Jerry Pellizzon, Ceradyne's Chief Financial Officer, to review some of the highlights of the financial statements, and perhaps give some further clarification before we go into the question-and-answer period. Jerry?\nJerry Pellizzon: Thank you, Joel. Good morning, everyone. I'll give you some numbers first of all, and then some information about the activity of some different business lines. First of all, we did file our 10-Q this morning with the SEC, so that you can also refer to that document by going to sec.gov. Our free cash flow, as defined as net income plus depreciation and amortization less capital expenditures, and including the impact of changes in working capital, for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 was $40.9 million compared to $48.9 million of the previous corresponding quarter. EBITDA or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 was $61.5 million compared to $65.9 million during the same period of last year. Depreciation and amortization for the current quarter was $8.8 million compared to $5.3 for the same period last year and CapEx this quarter amounted to $18.6 million compared to $7.2 million in a comparable period last year. A big part of that was our expansion and acquisition of additional property, land and buildings at our Kempten site in Germany or ESK in the support of continuing expansion in boron nitrite, silicon and other ceramic powders. DSOs were 42 days this year compared with 32 days last year, actually in April came back down. What's important to note that in terms of sales by market application, our defense sales were only 62.8% of the total sales this quarter compared to 77.4% the same quarter last year. So our strategic plan of getting a little more balance between defense and non-defense is working out very well. And in fact, the acquisitions that we made during 2007 performed very well. Minco that reports up through Thermo and supports our strategy with our expanding presence in the solar industry with these crucibles had an excellent quarter, performed as we planned. And our Ceradyne Boron Products division also performed well. Those two units contributed about $12.4 million of total sales in the quarter. Of course, we did not own them as of this point in the quarter of last year. Additionally, we did have a decline at ACO of 14.4% in sales. Our sales were $130 million compared to $152 million in the corresponding prior year. Of course, the primary reason was the decline in the shipments of ceramic body armor and other armor components. Those declines were actually $28.3 million to $115.6 million from $143.9 million of the previous year's quarter. We did have growth in other lines. Our engineered product line and functional coating line in Germany did well. We had growth in that particular segment. Overall, the margins this quarter as a percentage were less and that reflects a couple of major factors. One, our sales mix, of course, shifted towards more of our industrial components, which have lower margins than our defense business, and additionally, because of the reduced throughput in our plants for the production of body armor, we absorbed less fixed expenses than we had in the quarter ended March 31 of '07. So, the color on this quarter is that we've had a shift in mix. We don't expect the margins to really decline much further this year. We're optimistic that we've got programs in place to gain those margins back, and our acquisitions continue to perform well. So, we're very pleased with their contributions towards our strategy and also towards our financial performance. Joe?\nJoel Moskowitz: Thanks a lot, Jerry. Just a comment and then we'll go right into Q&A. This quarter, I think, which we're very pleased with, is a directly fulfills or at least beginning to fulfill our long-term diversification and strategic plans, which are to acquire companies in defense and non-defense. In this case, Jerry cited EaglePicher which is now Ceradyne Boron Products, the Minco acquisitions, which are completely non-defense, and to move in that direction and to expand internally, which we did both in crucibles, China which didn't exist last year. Remember that a plant only opened in June and probably didn't shipped much till the end of last year in Tianjin, as well as expansions in Germany where the product lines are almost all non-defense, expect for 20% or so that they shift to us for our boron carbide. So, so far, so good. So, thanks a lot, Jerry. And I think what we'll do now, Kara, is go right into the Q&A mode.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Tim Quillin with Stephens Incorporated.\nTim Quillin - Stephens Incorporated: Hi, good morning.\nJoel Moskowitz: Good morning, Tim.\nTim Quillin - Stephens Incorporated: First question is how should we think about the quarterly distribution of armor revenue for the rest of the year? Should we plan for it to be a little bit lower in 2Q and 3Q, and then higher in 4Q when presumably the XSAPI is awarded?\nJoel Moskowitz: That's a very good question. I think that I'll have Dave Reed response to it. Remember, Dave is responsible for all North American operations and he is very knowledgeable about armor programs. Dave?\nDave Reed: Hi, Tim. Yeah, I think the best way to look at that is in the first quarter we still were running at a fairly accelerated rate with our army business in January and the first half of February. So, we only saw our spread out of the business in the second half of the quarter. So, I think in second and third quarter we'll be down a little bit, maybe about $8 million to $10 million in sales of our body armor. In the fourth quarter we should be maybe a slight uptick from there and that will definitely depend on the XSAPI award and what level of that award we win, Tim?\nTim Quillin - Stephens Incorporated: Okay, which brings up the second question, what is your thinking in terms of the timing of the XSAPI award, and in terms of the latest military expectations on how many service members would actually be issued the XSAPI? Thank you.\nDave Reed: We don't have that final information on what the army is going to decide, whether they are going to rollout just initially with theater staging, which is typically in the 230,000 to 260,000 sets range, or whether they will announce early to go all the way to pure fleet. They have not made that decision or announcement to anyone at this point. What we've heard about the solicitation is that everything is going well. The testing is probably about half over now. As you know, they had multiple product demonstration samples from all of the vendors. So they have a lot of product to test and we expect the testing to be completed in early June now. So everything seems on line for awards to take place sometime mid to late Q3.\nTim Quillin - Stephens Incorporated: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Morgan.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan: Good morning, guys.\nJoel Moskowitz: Good morning, Al.\nJerry Pellizzon: Good morning, Al.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan: I want to focus on the new business opportunities, if I may. And I think the question is driven more at how do we see, maybe the ramp, and exclude solar, if we may, or ceramics, solar ceramics, but how do we see that business being perhaps ramping in particular? Is it contract-oriented, project-oriented or is it displacing existing competitors?\nJoel Moskowitz: Well, that's a very wide ranging question and I'll try to give you as best in the answer.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan: You only allow me one question now, Joel.\nJoel Moskowitz: Okay. Yeah, I know. We don't want to run out of time like this, let everybody else sit. So, anyway, my personal focus is very much on these new areas. As you said, we don't have to talk about solar, except for the fact that solar is really continuing do very well, as we said in the press release. Well, let's just look at a few things. First of all, the reason that Minco, this little acquisition that we did is doing so well, it's the same model as the ESK acquisition in '04, where we suddenly started buying tens of millions of dollars of boron carbide powder. In this case, we're not buying tens of millions, but we're buying millions of dollars of fused silica powder. So that program, that company will continue to be quite profitable and we'll be expanding. We're putting in millions of dollars in additional crushing at and refining equipment almost exclusively to service our own internal business. Before we bought it, Minco was only shipping about 8% to 9% of their product line to Ceradyne. So that's one business that is tied into solar and will continue. Some of the other businesses are very exciting. In Germany particularly, this coming quarter I was going over some of the projections, and they are looking at 10 million euros, as they put it because they report in euros. Jerry has got to figure out what the exchange rate is. But they're going to have three 10 million euro quarters back to back to back in 9 months. In Q2, that's the first time they'll have ever shipped 30 million euros and less and less of that. In fact, they revised downwards a year ago when we told them that the armor business we wouldn't be buying as much boron carbide, so almost all of that growth is in the silicon carbide seals for industrial pumps, in the surface engineered products where we coat medals with diamond and other ceramics for adhesion, and it's in the BORONEIGE, boron nitrite for cosmetics. You know one of my favorite subjects is aluminum smelting, and even though last year we received somewhere between a $0.5 million and $1 million for the whole year in R&D kind of orders, we've already received $1 million to $1.50 million in Q1, which will be shipped in Q2 for additional (inaudible), who are incorporating what's known as a drain cathode. That program, which I still think will be a small part of the company in 2008 this year, continues to grow from very little to low millions of dollars projected this year. And I have no reason to believe that that will not be in the next five years a major element. I've said in our annual report, which you don't have yet, that it is one of two billion dollar opportunities. One is aluminum and the other is combat vehicles. So, two years ago, if you had said, well, as Dave said, while we reduced our boron carbide armor significantly, yet our sales were about the same and our margins were 3 points lower, I would say, tell me where that's coming from? Well, it's coming from our acquisitions and it's coming from these other areas that I just mentioned.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan: Okay. So is it fair to say that the mix of revenue of 60%, 65% being defense, which I applauded the diversification there, that some could come from more acquisitions later this year than perhaps a project or two that you are bidding on that needs to be awarded?\nJoel Moskowitz: Yeah. I think that's a fair statement. We have nothing in that sales range I gave that assumes we do no acquisitions. In fact, we probably will do acquisitions.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan: And I'm sorry, that's included in there?\nJoel Moskowitz: No. There is zero acquisitions in the 715 to the 836.\nAl Kaschalk - Wedbush Morgan: Okay. I'll hop back in queue. Thank you.\nJoel Moskowitz: Okay.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pierre Maccagno with Needham.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham: On the quarter, I'm a little bit late here, but I wanted to ask you if you could talk a little bit more about the solar\u2026\nJerry Pellizzon: Pierre, could you just speak up, because we didn't get the first part of the question, please?\nPierre Maccagno - Needham: Yeah. If you could expand a little bit more on the solar opportunities and your expansion plans?\nJoel Moskowitz: Yeah, maybe I'll handle that. Bruce Lockhart is our President of that operation. He is in Atlanta and not on the call. Let me repeat, our product is this very high purity fused silica ceramic crucibles that are used in the manufacturing. These are single-use products, and therefore, the market is of a continuous nature. We could sell more if we could make more right now. And so, we are expanding both in Atlanta and in China. Last year, our shipments were about $10.7 million of this product. This year, in our budget, it's about $53 million and I think it could be slightly higher. If there is some upside surprises later in the year this is where it will be. It will be closer and maybe closer to 60 than 50. And in '09, assuming that our plant is on stream we'll double that and we're looking at $100 million to $135 million in '09. I recently had a briefing on this, both of internally as well as some solar shows that our people attended, and I believe that this market will increase at an increasing rate, primarily because of new sources of silicon. That's a bottleneck right now as many people know in both semiconductor as well as in solar. But companies like Volker and Hemlock and others are putting on their own silicon manufacturing. And as that comes on stream, two things will happen. One, there will be more product and they will have to melt more and they will use more of our crucibles, which is our whole model, and the second thing is that price will come down. The pricing has been quite high on silicon, which acts as an inhibitor for our photovoltaic solar. And as the price comes down of silicon, which is nothing to do with us, but does drive the total market, I think we're going to see more and more business. And our task at Ceradyne is to make sure that we can make these make them to the quality. We do have a secret that allows us to make what we believe is the highest purity crucible currently in the market.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham: And two more follow-ups here. The industries\u2026\nJoel Moskowitz: We're supposed to have one question, Pierre.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham: Just one?\nJoel Moskowitz: Yeah. Okay, you've got one more. But Al is going to be upset, because he stayed with one. Go ahead.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham: The industries migrating to the jumbo type of crucible, and that has higher ASP. So do you believe that you're going to be selling mostly jumbo?\nJoel Moskowitz: Yeah, the question that Pierre asked -- he is very knowledgeable on the specifics of the solar industry -- is for long time the standard size was able to make 225 kilograms per run. And that's effectively most of the business we're doing, crucibles that handle 225 kilograms of silicon, about $50,000 worth of silicon every time the customer makes a run. The next generation, which is actually in the field right now, is to double that. They call it the 450, because it makes 450 kilograms. And we believe that will be a good part of the future. So we've done two things. One, we have a facility in Atlanta that we had actually mothballed years ago with a huge tunnel kill. So we've reactivated that and we're making jumbo crucibles here in Atlanta. And also the new facility will be sized, all the slip casting molds, drying and firing, to make both standards in jumbos. We think the future will be jumbo because of the obvious economics to our customers. And it's very good business for Ceradyne because, as you said, the pricing, the average selling price is significantly higher than the 225s.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham: And finally, there could be a short supply of these crucibles, do you think the ASPs are going to go up or do you see any of that happening right now?\nJoel Moskowitz: Well, we don't know. Right now, we're able to maintain the pricing. There are people who are trying to get into business. We are not the major supplier. The major supplier is a division of Cookson. We would represent that our product is quite good because of what I said earlier. There could be price pressures later on, not right now. Right now, the industry just wants to get as many as they can.\nPierre Maccagno - Needham: Great.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jiwon Lee with Sidoti & Company. Mr. Lee your line is open.\nJiwon Lee - Sidoti & Company: Hello.\nJoel Moskowitz: Mrs. Lee.\nOperator: I do apologize, Ms. Lee\nJiwon Lee - Sidoti & Company: Okay. Let me ask quick questions on MRAP II. One more quarter has progressed, how should we look at that business potential from where we are now?\nJoel Moskowitz: I think I'd let Mark and Dave handle that. Mr. MRAP, Marc came in from Washington and he was with the BULL. So, Marc?\nMarc King: Thank you, Good morning, Jiwon.\nJoel Moskowitz: I didn't mean to make any reference to your wife when I said you live with the BULL.\nMarc King: Good morning, Jiwon. The MRAP II program continues on. The department says there is a MRAP II in our case, our vehicles are on the test site. They continue to test, they continue to test well. The team BULL, as you know, consisting of Ceradyne, Oshkosh Truck and Ideal Innovations has received some additional inspections by the department to check on our ability to manufacture product. Those inspections have been completed. Report outs have been made, everything is green. And so, we continue to test program and we will see where the department wants to go. At this point in time, the only information that we can provide is that testing is ongoing and that we are waiting to see where the department wants to go with the program.\nJiwon Lee - Sidoti & Company: Okay. I'm going to step aside for now. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Liebowitz with Wachovia.\nGary Liebowitz - Wachovia: I think, Jerry, you talked about you had some cost savings initiatives that you believe will offset some of the overhead absorption issues as production rates come down on ESAPI. Can you quantify or maybe discuss what some of those cost savings are beyond the deal they also already announced?\nJerry Pellizzon: Sure. I'll start. We have an aggressive lean manufacturing program here. We have different methodologies of producing armor that we are constantly upgrading. And we are always looking for cost savings. We produced many hundreds of thousands of body armor plates and we continue to lower our cost based on the knowledge of continuing efforts and knowledge of what we've done in the past and how we're going to lower those costs in the future. The programs are ongoing. They are everyday. The best way I can put it are a small incremental improvements as frequently as we can make them. And that's really where we are.\nGary Liebowitz - Wachovia: Okay. But is there like an annualized cost savings run rate that you are targeting and any sense of where you stand relative to that target?\nJerry Pellizzon: Well, we have an annual plan for margin and we try to stick to that. That's hard to quantify right now, Gary, because of the sales mix of products. But believe me, as you know, there aren't many manufacturing companies that have the type of gross margins and operating margins that we do. And we gain that through a lot of expertise, through a lot of leverage, and paying attention to details. And those programs that I suggested that we have lean manufacturing programs, we have different material that we're using and it's a consortium of many different aspects of efforts to reduce cost. I don't have a firm numbers as to what it is for the year because we have a certain plan based on a sales mix and it will be hard to quantify right now.\nGary Liebowitz - Wachovia: Okay. Fair enough. And my follow-up question relates to LTAS, I think you guys mentioned that you're going to have a consultant review of the market opportunity with you and how that might play out. Could you share with us the findings?\nJoel Moskowitz: Yeah. I think I'll again ask Marc and Dave to chime in on this.\nMarc King: Yeah, we did have that study done. There are significant opportunities for LTAS armor going forward. It's important to understand from Ceradyne's perspective that the LTAS opportunity that we presented to the government has been certified by the government. What's been certified are essentially targets. Those targets are now in discussion to be turned into product with various customers. We are, in fact, unfortunately nondisclosure agreements prevent me from giving specifics on customer opportunity that are being worked. What I can tell you is that there are customer opportunities being worked right now where those materials are now being turned into product applications for specific vehicles for ongoing testing and use going forward. So we're very pleased with the results that we're getting. It will be an ongoing opportunity for us as we go forward. And applications are being designed as we speak that should be placed on vehicles that the military will be are procuring in the near future.\nGary Liebowitz - Wachovia: But as far as a near-term opportunity goes we're not talking about something material to Ceradyne's results for at least one or two years?\nMarc King: I would say that's probably accurate. It's a process that has to be gone through and turning it from test materials into product, product into further testing on the vehicle, satisfying the customers' requirements regarding overall performance, and then turning it into a production opportunity.\nGary Liebowitz - Wachovia: Thank you very much.\nJoel Moskowitz: One note on that and I'll amplify because you began your question about the study we had commissioned, which is now complete. They identified 12 programs with multiple OEMs that would require armoring over the next 10 year periods. And we have those 12 and that's the heart of what we're looking at. There was also an article in the defense news that cited requirements of over 40,000 vehicles going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josephine Millward with Stanford Group.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Good morning.\nJoel Moskowitz: Good morning, Josephine\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Hi. I wanted to ask about the independent report, Congressional report criticizing the army for not doing enough taxing and evaluation prior to awarding body armor contracts. Do you think this might push out the timing of awards on XSAPI?\nJoel Moskowitz: I'll let Dave handle that.\nDavid Reed: Josephine, I don't think so, no. That report in many ways was more of an administrative issue. They basically said that the review of the contract file showed that they didn't think all of the first article test reports had been put in the files properly. And in some cases, a contract said they should do first article. But they didn't see in that contract it had been done, when in fact the first article of that design had been done on a prior contract. So, in the end, the army does have first article reports for everything that's introduced. Ceradyne has first article reports on every product we've ever sent into the army and we have lot testing on everything that has left this facility. So, I believe the army briefed Congress on that two weeks ago and everybody is pretty satisfied with those results. So I see it as more of an administrative thing, and it doesn't appear to be upsetting anybody in the contract side in terms of their review of the current PDMs or the process on that solicitation. So we don't see any push out on that due to the Inspector General's report.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Okay. Dave, so do you still expect XSAPI award around September with delivery starting in October?\nDavid Reed: I believe that contracts will be let in that timeframe. Their deliveries may be out further than that. They may start asking for deliveries in November or December. But we are prepared to begin production in October and they always allow early delivery on this contract. So, they are not sure when the exact delivery dates will be. But as far as I can see right now, Josephine, the awards will be made in the time manner that would allow us to continue our operations without any shortfall.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Okay. So you've accounted for a possible delivery start date in November and December in your revised guidance?\nDavid Reed: No, we sure were going to start in October deliveries right now.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Right. Okay. I just have one final question. In your body armor backlog, have you included the two recently announced awards, the contracts that were announced in April?\nDavid Reed: Yes, we have. The only surprise there for us, on the positive side was on the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia order. That was a little bit higher than what was in our plan for the year. So that's given us, right now, about extra $10 million cushion in the plan.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: I'm sorry, Dave. I'm talking about your body armor backlog. Wouldn't that be at the end of March, because your side plate order was announced in April, so you've included that in your backlog?\nDavid Reed: Yes, we have.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: Okay. So, you haven't included the DLA order in your backlog, just the side plate order?\nDavid Reed: Yeah, we did get that on March. Both of those orders are included in Q1.\nJosephine Millward - Stanford Group: They're both included. Okay, thank you.\nDavid Reed: Yes, they are.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Avinash Kant with Broadpoint Capital.\nAvinash Kant - Broadpoint Capital: A quick question going back on the solar side, I wanted to find out would you be able to comment on your market share that you have on the solar crucible side and what is the differentiation here? Is that the technology or the materials know-how that you have or is more about volume and pricing in that business?\nJoel Moskowitz: Well, right now, as I said earlier, it really is driven by this terrific demand, and pricing is always a subject near and dear to our hearts. But it's basically driven by getting those crucibles into the field immediately. We make them, we ship them, they use then. I mean, it's just that simple. We hardly have any inventories. Regarding our market share, we were late in this game. If it wasn't for some of the difficulties that our competitor had, we might not be in the game. But about seven, eight years ago, we were alerted BP Solar about these issues in the States. So, that was our first major thrust. And a year or two ago, I would have said we had about 15% of the market. I think that we probably have about 30% of the market right now. But the data has skimpy on that, but I would use that kind of number.\nAvinash Kant - Broadpoint Capital: But Joel, what I'm trying to understand is that, given the opportunity in this business, how easy or how hard it is for new players to come in and start to be a competitor here.\nJoel Moskowitz: Okay. Well, I think that since Dave is involved in beefing up Minco silica, and as I said, we do have a proprietary, I referred to it as secret technology; I'll let Dave address new people who might want to come into the market.\nDavid Reed: Well, we do view that there are some exceptional barriers to entry in this business. It's a very expensive process to melt this high purity silicon. And when you come in with your first crucible, if that crucible cracks or fails, then they leak molten metal into the furnace, ruin in the furnace, take it out of the line for several weeks to repair it. So, it's very difficult to get into the business and when you get into the business, to be successful, you have to have enough technology to not have real problems with your yields, the cracking and the drying and the firing of these products. So, it's not easy. Our customers are very loyal and their margins are dependent on very high throughput and high yield on their end. So, they are not very likely to risk this product in their production capacity on some new players entering. So, we see it as very difficult for the new players to get into this market.\nAvinash Kant - Broadpoint Capital: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Simon with JMP Securities.\nJason Simon - JMP Securities: Good morning. I just had a quick question. Did you guys made any progress on maybe leasing a new facility in the Wixom area, in the Michigan area with respect to the MRAP II programs?\nJerry Pellizzon: Good morning, Jason. This is Jerry. We have made substantial progress. We are probably about 95% complete with our lease on our negotiations, and I think we're just waiting really on for information from the government relative to timing and we would be prepared to sign that lease for that facility.\nJason Simon - JMP Securities: Okay. And have you guys locked up any supply agreements for any type of pending orders?\nDavid Reed: Jason, on the supply side, for the BULL, the materials that we need which is based on the design that we've given the government are fairly, readily available and they do not compete with many of the advanced materials that are being used on the MRAP I. So, we got actually glowing reports from the government on that side of our proposal that we would not force them to do any kind of delegation of the materials and they won't have to manage that event. So, we feel pretty good about that. As Marc said earlier and Joel said, the review of our facilitization by the government two weeks ago went very well, and they are very confident that the facility plan and the production plan will be successful.\nJason Simon - JMP Securities: Good stuff. Marc, you talked earlier about, obviously, the testing going well for the BULL. Have you heard anything about the [Cayman]?\nMarc King: We have no information about what's going on with the Cayman?\nJason Simon - JMP Securities: Okay. And if you were to expect any type of award announcement out of the military when you think that would be?\nJoel Moskowitz: Right now, it's anticipated that probably towards the end of May, early June there may be another announcement. But again, at this point that's based on speculation based on the military's timing. It could go longer than that. We're not really sure. The majority of our testing will be wrapped up towards the end of May. And the only testing that will go one will be some of the durability testing, which is ongoing at Yuma, Arizona they have the log 15,000 miles on to the test vehicles there. Currently, as of last night, the test vehicles have 1,700 test miles logged on to them. They are logging about on average 200 miles a day. So, it's going to take them a little bit of time. That's based on government timing on how long they want to keep you guys out on the test track. They've been having some weather condition problems out there. They go to Yuma because it's dry and dusty. Unfortunately, the wind has being blowing a lot, so it affects the testing out there. So that's going to affect the test schedules just a little bit. But it's our understanding that the durability testing is not have to be complete before the government moves forward with other decisions once the rest of the testing environmentals. And I should add that, just this past week some of the ballistic testing was done. Again, we've got a green light on everything regarding ballistic testing with the vehicle that went forward. So, once all of that has complied and presented to the contract decision authorities, decision will go forward at that time.\nJason Simon - JMP Securities: Great. Thanks very much, everybody.\nJoel Moskowitz: You're welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael French with Morgan Joseph.\nMichael French - Morgan Joseph: Good morning gentlemen.\nJerry Pellizzon: Good morning.\nJoel Moskowitz: Good morning, Michael.\nMichael French - Morgan Joseph: Joel, I was intrigued by your comment that you will probably do an acquisition and so this year. And I've known you long enough to know that you're pretty conservative and wouldn't like to make a comment like that unless there was thing or two in the works. I'd just like to ask about the number of potential deals, the timing, strategy, whether you are looking to do more vertical deals or go horizontal into other markets and pricing, if you want to talk about that.\nJoel Moskowitz: Well, I'll just say that we are looking at acquisitions and inferred that I expected that will do some this year. We don't make specific comments on acquisitions until we usually have an SPA, a sales and purchase agreement. But in general, we're looking at four acquisitions. One is defense, the other three are non-defense. They are in a very broad array of opportunities from effectively a start-up with a genius patent that is using our ceramics right now to a very mature company that's providing materials into the molten metal industry. The range is anywhere on this small side less than $10 million to possibly hundreds of millions of dollars. So it's a very broad range. And we are working on this right now. I would expect, hopefully, within the next quarter that we'll announce at least one of the small ones and maybe one not so small both in non-defense.\nMichael French - Morgan Joseph: Okay, great. Thank you. That's good. I appreciate that. And Jerry, I have a quick one for you on the share count. Press release says that you purchased 1 million shares I suppose today, it sounds like, just wondering if you could give a share count as of today?\nJerry Pellizzon: Sure. We purchased 1 million shares through the end of the first quarter through March 31 at an average cost of approximately $30 a share and the share count is $26.6 million right now. And as I said or as I insinuated at least, we've got about $70 million left on our authorization. And the impact of that will be felt really on the second quarter earnings because of the weighted average component and computation. It really wasn't much impact at all in the first quarter because we purchased beginning in the first week of March. So, the weighted average impact was negligible or very, very limited.\nMichael French - Morgan Joseph: Got you. And could you address the desire to continue with this program? I mean, what are the odds of you spending the other 70?\nJoel Moskowitz: I think that's an area of, I'll just chime in, that we'd rather not discuss. We have our own strategies. We're getting inputs from the people who are actually doing the purchasing in the field. So far we've done pretty good job. And we said that we would repurchase up to $100 million. That's our plan. Exactly what our strategy is, whether we're going to start buying after we get off this call or not, for example, we're not going to discuss.\nJerry Pellizzon: Let me just shed one other thing to be clear. We are in a blackout period. Our blackout policy is such that we go dark the last day of each quarter. We stay dark until the second full day after an earnings announcement. So, we wouldn't be out in the marketplace until next Tuesday. And that's our policy and that's what we work with. So, we are, by the way, limited now by the number of shares through a program, and actually a security regulation, 10P18. And if we were to be purchasing today, we would be limited to 120,000 shares per day for this week. It's a weekly calculation. You take the average of the trading over the last four weeks and then divide that by the number of trading days, which is usually 20, and then multiply that by 25%. And that's your limitation.\nMichael French - Morgan Joseph: Okay, great. Thank you and good luck.\nJoel Moskowitz: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Butler with FBR.\nBrian Butler - FBR: Can you hear me?\nJoel Moskowitz: Yeah, we can hear you.\nBrian Butler - FBR: Okay. Good morning. Thanks. A question just on the guidance that you gave, you reaffirmed the $4.55 to the $5.05, is it possible to break that down into what it might look like, excluding the BULL completely?\nJoel Moskowitz: Well, the BULL is excluded completely. There is no BULL in that $4.55.\nBrian Butler - FBR: Right. But I guess, is there a range above the $4.55 or that's your guidance for the rest of that business, there's really no range for the rest of the business?\nJoel Moskowitz: Of course, there is a range. If we get the order late in the year, we don't ship that many BULLs.\nBrian Butler - FBR: No, not really specific to the BULLs. I meant to the rest of your business. I mean it sounds like you have some opportunities such in the solar cell doing 60, instead of 50. So it seems like that $4.55 there seems to be arranged somewhere above that that excludes the BULL, and I am just trying to figure out what that is?\nJoel Moskowitz: It could be. We usually don't refine projections to that level. I mean Dave told you we got extra business out of Philadelphia that add about $10 million and I inferred that if we get our shipments really rolling out in Tianjin, we might pick up another $7 million. But there are other areas that maybe we won't quite make the projections. So you are right, there is a whole spread without the BULL. But we're not prepared to adjust our guidance in that manner, unless we see our way clear, which we might after Q2.\nJerry Pellizzon: And just to reiterate, that $10 million from Philadelphia was shipments for sales.\nBrian Butler - FBR: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blanton with Ingalls & Snyder.\nAlex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Hi, Good Morning. Most of my questions have been answered. But on the BULL, and they were all about the BULL program, just to clarify what you said about the durability testing going on in Yuma, you said 200 miles a day and how many miles have yet to be done?\nJoel Moskowitz: There is a requirement to do 15,000 miles.\nAlex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: And you've done 1,500 or something\nJoel Moskowitz: Right now, they've accumulated 17,000 miles on vehicles.\nAlex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Okay.\nJoel Moskowitz: At the rate that they are going. That definitely didn't start until about eight days ago.\nAlex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Okay.\nJoel Moskowitz: So they average about 200 miles a day, sometime they do more, sometime they do less, depends on weather conditions and other factors, assuming the vehicle operates normally, they may accumulate more miles on a given day. It has to do with the availability of army personnel, testing personnel. It's driven by schedule leads, that's done by the army and not by us. They are on the site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week ready to test.\nAlex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Yeah. If they went ahead 200 miles day, they are 2.5 months. And did you say it would have to be completed before the order is issued or not.\nJoel Moskowitz: No. The durability testing does have to be completed before an order would be issued. They have sufficient data accumulated, that gives them an idea. Remember we are dealing with the mobility platform that over 10,000 of them currently reside in United States Marine Corps. So they have plethora of data that already exists on the durability of the platform itself.\nAlex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Sure.\nJoel Moskowitz: All they're doing here is verifying additional data on how the platform performs with changes that have been made to accommodate the armored solution that's on the platform. So they take some of that data and extrapolate it based on previous data accumulated for the MTVR mobility platform. A combined data, they do some analysis and they say we have enough information to tell us what we need going forward in terms of durability, reliability and maintainability in order to make a decision going forward.\nAlex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Okay. So the difference between your - the low-end of the range that includes the bull and the one that doesn't is a $121 million. It appears that that would be your sales contribution in roughly the fourth quarter is that correct, for this year?\nJoel Moskowitz: The original plan that this came up would assume more than just the fourth quarter.\nAlex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Yeah. I know the original plan did, but the original called for $287 million of sales for this year. So\u2026\nJoel Moskowitz: The February numbers included shipping something late in the third and in the fourth quarter.\nAlex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Yeah, late in the third and in the fourth, that's a $121 million differences that you've got there, right.\nDavid Reed: Alex it's a ramp up production, assuming that we would have gotten an order sometime late in Q2.\nAlex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Okay.\nDavid Reed: So we'll start our production ramp in Q3, and we'd be at a full scale production pretty much at the beginning of Q4.\nAlex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of [Don Littlewood with Littlewood Burke].\nDon Littlewood - Littlewood Burke: I don't want to beat a dead bull but, what are your partners' ideal innovations, signed a partnership agreement with the US Army Joint Manufacturing Center regarding armor for the BULL. Now they are your partner also in a BULL. How did that work?\nDavid Reed: Don, that's a good question. They provide some of the outer layers, so that's part of their proprietary developments and why they are on the team. They are a specialist in the EFP protection, and they've always been providing that material. They are working with Rock Island Arsenal to have that part made for them and then supplied to Ceradyne, where we will incorporate it on to the armored cab that we've always being responsible for; then that armored cab is shift over to Oshkosh for incorporation on to the platform. So it's just really - they are our answer to how to get their component of the teaming agreement produced.\nDon Littlewood - Littlewood Burke: Sounds to me like there's some kind of an implication there about the chances of Ceradyne being involved in this. The other question I have has to do with Oshkosh and your lightweight HEMTT crew cab. You had an initial order back in February I believe. What's happen with that?\nDavid Reed: But let me address your first question. There is a no concern about the armor to start one. Ideal has always been supplying these outer components for the solution, and they were going to be make them themselves originally, now they're working with one of the depots and they feel that actually give us a leg up with the government by involving the government's facilities in the production of the BULL. So we view that as a positive.\nDon Littlewood - Littlewood Burke: That's what I mean.\nDavid Reed: Okay.\nDon Littlewood - Littlewood Burke: That's what I mean.\nDavid Reed:  Second one I'll let Marc to answer on the A4 cab.\nMarc King: That's actually the A3 cab, the lightweight A3 cab is a design, the engineering teams are in close and continuing discussion on design of the specific armor application for that A3 cab. Please recall that the A3 cab itself is in all-composite cab that's used on the HEMTT mobility chassis. All of that work is ongoing and it's scheduled for our scheduled delivery in the third quarter this year for prototype application and then some testing to be done by Oshkosh at the army test center in Aberdeen, Maryland. So that's on track, everything seems to be going well, and testing of the materials in a product form is also going well.\nDon Littlewood - Littlewood Burke:  Okay, very good thank you.\nJoel Moskowitz: And Kara we have four in the queue, we'll take those four.\nOperator:  Yes, sir. Your next question comes from the line of [David Kaizer] with Robotti & Company.\nDavid Kaizer - Robotti & Company: Hi. Good morning guys.\nDavid Reed:  Good morning.\nDavid Kaizer - Robotti & Company:  Quick question, two parts but very quick. What is the production capacity for the BULL in the given year let's say, and I think you released not too long ago but if you could repeat what ex number of BULLs would add to EPS and also clarify if that EPS number was prior to buyback or post buyback?\nDavid Reed: Well, let me answer the production capacity issue. We gave the government a plan with the original solicitation to be able to make 4,000 vehicles per year, and so we have a plan to go everywhere from 500 vehicles per year all the way to 4000 vehicles per year. So, we have our various facilitization plans to perform that, and it depends on the level of the order on how large that facility is. Jerry said earlier he has a couple of options for us available in Michigan to expand out of our Wixom prototyping facility to meet the requirements of that production. The earnings-per-share obviously is very much dependent on the level of that order, and I'll let Jerry say how much was in the guidance.\nJerry Pellizzon: Sure. First of all, the original guidance was pre-buyback, so that doesn't include any of the impact of the buyback. And then the range that we had was 715 to 836, and that was the range that included basically some provision for the BULL. But what's difficult to really say is when we're going to start shipping and what the ramp is so\u2026\u2026\u2026\nDavid Kaizer - Robotti & Company: I think my question is actually more general and a little more specific at the same time. I thought there was a release that said something like 300 BULLs adds $0.50 of\u2026\nDavid Reed: No.\nJerry Pellizzon: But that was, we never have gone to that specificity at all.\nDavid Kaizer - Robotti & Company: Okay. That's it. So we\u2026\nJerry Pellizzon: Just to reiterate, we gave guidance of 715 to 836 on February 26th of this year. The earnings range was $4.55 to $5.05, and that's the range that we gave.\nDavid Kaizer - Robotti & Company: Okay. Thank you for the clarification.\nJerry Pellizzon: You're very welcome.\nOperator: Your next question is a follow up from the line of Tim Quillin with Stephens Incorporated.\nTim Quillin - Stephens Incorporated: Thank you for taking my question. I was just wondering, if you could tell us what kind of interest rates you're getting on your cash investments right now; and also just some kind of status on the auction rate securities in your portfolio? Thank you.\nJerry Pellizzon: Sure. Well, there are two components to that. On pure overnights, we are probably in the low 2s. Generally when we go out further on institutional money markets and other programs like that, we're in the 3.25 range to 3.50. And the auction rate securities, there hasn't been a whole lot of development in that, the market is still extremely ill liquid. I think the good news is that we took the permanent write down at the end of 2007. And the only additional permanent that we've had to that, we reflected in the first quarter was a $147,000. So, I think that that is just a function of the credit markets working that out over time. We're patient with it. We presently have $216 million of cash. So there's no impact to our operation at all with regard to that ill liquid, ill liquidity portion of that investment, and we're just going to be patient and go forward with that.\nTim Quillin - Stephens Incorporated: Thank you.\nJerry Pellizzon: You're welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from [Dan Berkery with O'Connor].\nDan Berkery - O'Connor: Hi. Are you there?\nDavid Reed: Yeah, hi Dan.\nDan Berkery - O'Connor: Hello?\nOperator: Mr. Berkery, your line is open.\nDan Berkery - O'Connor: I'll follow up on those cash question. The 185 that you have in cash and cash equivalents, is any auction rate in there or is all the auction rate in the long term investment?\nJerry Pellizzon: All the auction rate is in the long-term investment. All the 185 is daily cash, that's at par of course, and it earns interest as I stated it earlier. But the auction rate is in long term investment side of the business, balance sheet rather.\nDan Berkery - O'Connor: Okay. And that's all in treasuries in very liquid thing. Correct.\nJerry Pellizzon: Yeah. The short-term securities are institutional money market, component out of treasuries and other things.\nDan Berkery - O'Connor: The second question on that 185 is, for tax and domicile purposes. Is that usable for some of the acquisitions that you talked about or is any of it sort of tied up overseas and you have to pay taxes on it to bring it back to make an acquisitions.\nJoel Moskowitz: No. we have always been consistent with the fact that we raised those funds for the purpose. One of the purposes was for acquisitions. All of those funds could be used for acquisitions, we have no tax impact to use those funds for acquisitions.\nDan Berkery - O'Connor: Okay. And how do we weigh the, you usually talked about small acquisitions but you also talked about one that could be hundreds of millions in terms, I assume that was in terms of revenue, not the actual acquisition price, but if any clarifications on that. And then, how should we weigh the stock buyback versus the acquisitions and the use of that 185 of cash?\nJoel Moskowitz: Well, as I discussed in prior releases and we stated consistently that we felt because Jerry reported earlier, we had a $40 million free cash flow in Q1. That we are going to be generating cash all year at something along that rate. It could be a little bit less as we go forward, a little bit more. So, we are very comfortable that the buyback will not affect our abilities to do the acquisitions that we are looking at, except, as you pointed out, I did mention there could be one large one, I didn't say whether it would be sales or earnings. I mean sales or the purchase price would be 100s of millions. It would be both actually, and that would be something that would probably not be a 100% cash. It could have some stock component, depending on how we feel the price of the stock is. Obviously, we are doing a buyback right now, because we feel it's an attractive price of the stock So, the buyback will not affect our ability to pay cash for any of the acquisitions, except if we go forward with this very major one. That depends on a lot of things, including that we might want to put some debt on the books or we might want to complete our cash and we might want to do a cash and stock deal, but it's too early to even speculate on that.\nDan Berkery - O'Connor: Okay. The follow up is sort of aside, but in the Minco business do you supply any raw materials similar to the armor model to your potential competitors, and at either Vesuvius, in terms crucibles?\nJoel Moskowitz: No, we don't. We are not supplying any of our materials, because we are using everything we can make right now.\nDan Berkery - O'Connor: Right, but if other people entered the markets, would you ever envision it being like the armor model or no, it's a more of a vertically integrated, you are not going to supply\nDavid Reed: No we could do that. We have the capacity, and we would look at the numbers, and if we could do that we would do it.\nDan Berkery - O'Connor: Okay. Thank you very much. Good luck.\nDavid Reed: Okay.\nJerry Pellizzon: Thank you.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Gary Liebowitz with Wachovia.\nGary Liebowitz - Wachovia.: Well Jerry CapEx spending for the year, seems like it was a little bit heavy than I saw in the first quarter. Are you still looking for about $50 million.\nJerry Pellizzon: We are. The first quarter was impacted by the acquisition of property in Germany; that was a one time event. We are on par for about 50 million or approximately 50 million for the total of 2008.\nGary Liebowitz - Wachovia.: Okay. And is that changing while in '09 for any reason that we see already.\nJerry Pellizzon: Well, no. as of now we don't have any major changes that would depend on where we are with some of our new programs, but I would say it's not going to change too much.\nGary Liebowitz - Wachovia.: Okay. Thanks again.\nJerry Pellizzon: You're welcome.\nOperator:  I would like to turn the call back to management for any presentation or any closing remarks.\nJoel Moskowitz: Well thank you, Kara. And I would like to thank everyone who asked quite good questions actually. And I know many of you were sort of been on these calls for so long. We're very comfortable that you're knowledgeable about what you were asking and that your interest in Ceradyne continues. And I just want to express management's thank you for that. I also want to reiterate that as sort of the old timer, the crowd here and the founder at 67, it's exiting for me to see these developments. And it's particularly exiting when Jerry says at reports of 62 and changed percent of our shipments. We have nothing to do with defense. It means that what we said and have been saying for quite a while, that we're an advanced technical ceramic company and we make boron carbide which is a lightest, hardest material for a certain applications. It stops bullet and we save the American lives. That is not the whole company. The whole company is the whole company which includes all of these areas. Alternative energy now is becoming more and more important not only solar, but unconventional oil recovery in Canada and Colorado, windmill, ceramic bearings. We actually have some small opportunities now in tidal generation of electricity where the pipes require ceramic linings. So they don't ware out. And we are presuming all of these. One of the interesting things that I'll make a point, because you do follow our company so closely is that we've made our first major a move in integrating from the German operation and the United States. Our non-defense our sales group will now be headed by a senior person in Kempton, Germany, Ms. Barbara Shoff, and we are very pleased about that. Barbara is very experienced person in industrial and consumer applications of technical ceramics, and this is an exciting thing for us to do what we had planned to do when we did the acquisition. So, thanks again and we are looking forward to our call after Q2. That concludes my comments Kara.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."}], "2010": [{"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 4, "year": 2009, "date": "2010-01-28 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M fourth quarter earnings conference call. During the presentation, all participants will in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, January 28, 2010. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nMatt Ginter: Thank you. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter business review. It was great to see many of you in New York last month for our 2010 outlook meeting. I know it's early here in 2010, but we have set a date for next year's event. So please mark your calendars for the morning of Tuesday, December 7. Complete details regarding timing and location will be available later this year. Joining me on today's call is George Buckley, 3M Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Pat Campbell, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2009 along with our outlook for 2010. A power point presentation accompanies today's conference call. It's available on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com. Today's presentation and the audio replay will be archived on our website for be an extended period of time. If I could ask when we get to Q&A today you ask you that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We have plenty of material to cover today and I'm sure we will have plenty of questions so we do want to be fair to everybody. So, thank you for honoring that. And before we begin please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements on slide two. During today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about out future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. So, let's begin today's review. Turn to slide number three. And I will hand it over to George.\nGeorge Buckley: Thank you very much, Matt. Happy New Year everybody and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter call. As the results indicate by staying on plan we are able to deliver another excellent quarter. One that came in a nice little bit stronger than we forecast. You all know the fundamentals of our plan, tight control of spending at factories while retaining a focus on generating cash and using innovation to ethically drive sales as (pure) market share and customer excitement everywhere. We worked very hard these past few years doing a lot of heavy (spade) work but it's paying off. Much of what we did back then prepared us very well for this economic downturn. That's notwithstanding a superb execution by 3M's people in 2009. Like were always offering surprises but we are increasing the confident in both the design and implementation of our plan, especially because our business gains strength and momentum in 2009 went on culminating in the quarter that we reported today. So, in the context of the economic environment in which we operate, Q4 was a successful quarter in a very difficult but ultimately rewarding year for 3M. To me a hugely important distinguishing factor of 2009 was our resolve to maintain investments in our future. And that is going to be paying off. We maintained a significant investment of more than a billion dollars in R&D at a time when many companies were forced to drastically cut back in this area. And we still pulled off great free cash flow conversion even with $900 million investments in CapEx last year. Those investments are clear and present signal of our confidence in the future of 3M. In fact I have personally never been more confident during my tenure here. We have demonstrated our ability to not only weather the storm but to emerge from it as an even stronger company. 2009 was also a year that certainly tested mental of the people at 3M and in many other companies too. I would roughly say the communications sections here that after our experiences in 2009 our team will never be afraid of another business challenge in their lives ever again. In many ways my confidence that of our leadership team is a reflection of the confidence our people now have in themselves. That said we need to be mindful of the economic challenges that still remain. After all sales for the 2009 year was still down 8.5% and there is still no real sign of sustained demand in some key market segments such as automotive, housing and commercial construction. Across the abroad there was a very strong quarter of each of our businesses posting impressive sales growth accompanied by even more impressive operating income growth. As you can see on the chart we turned in a record Q4 on several metrics and I\u2019m especially pleased that our full year EPS came in at 469 well within our original expected range from a year ago, quite remarkable really when you think about it. (Inaudible) we earned in Q4 was itself a record high for that particular quarter at 3M. Among the highlights in the quarter was continued strength in respiratory protection and largely because of H1N1 related demand. But before you know what, before we go off and attribute this wholly to serendipity, the fact is that we put the capacity in place early falling a thorough and balanced assessment of the opportunities to growth in that area and it paid off. And when demand our strip capacity in the middle of the crisis we responded superbly and quickly with new capacity. With our new line of low cost respirators about to hit the market, I'm glad that we did it. We are going to need that capacity even if H1N1 demand falls off soon. There is a similar story in optical systems where sales rose by 53% year on year driven by new product for eco-friendly LCD displays. You recall that we saw the same growth pattern in Q3 as well. Again, even after some terrible pressure from commoditization of optical a couple of years ago we created the marketing ideas and energy saving and battery life extension and the product to go along with it, we never gave up. We stuck to our mantra of new product development, worked our factory costs hard and worked closely with customers on the value proposition that we developed and it paid off. Great results and certainly not an accident. Congratulations to those folks in OSD that made it happen. You should know that we are taking similar quarters in new generation of braces, adhesive levels, renewable energy, adhesives, special dirt proofing super (hub) referred coatings and many others and we look forward to similar although perhaps not as dramatic results as these new products and derivatives come on stream. Moving on to some other health highlights. Health care was again a star in the quarter. But all our businesses delivered increases year-over-year. Of note, infection prediction turned in a superb quarter with 14% local currency growth. Industrial and transportation sales grew 10% in dollars led by renewable energy which posted again at more than 40% and the capacity for renewable energy film is just coming on stream in Singapore. (inaudible) and his management team had an extraordinary tough year in the industrial spaces but they dealt with the challenges superbly. It was a joy to see them do it. Consumer offense held its own on organic volume and let\u2019s face it, that was really hard to do last year. But a real story here is acquisitions especially Futuro and ACE and how they establish strengthening our position in the drugstore channel. Our target this coming year is to accelerate our consumer activity overseas with the acquisition of new local brands and some new product adjacencies. Asia Pacific led the way internationally with gains in our electronics related businesses and more importantly in our established core businesses too. Our localization efforts are really paying off. The lab in China in particular is delivering great new products with their new product vitality next already in the mid to late 30s and growing faster than anywhere else in the company. You know, it's funny, but in the year when the chips were down for just about everybody, everywhere that so often happens people rally around the cause and delivered super results and although it sounds a bit sloppy but I'm really proud of them and I think that they should be proud of themselves too. Pat will now give you the details and I will come back to discuss the year ahead in due course. Pat?\nPat Campbell: Thanks George and good morning. Please turn to slide number four. For the fourth quarter, earnings were $1.30 per share on both the GAAP reported and on adjusted basis an increase of 69% and 34% respectively, on an adjusted bases this would be a record result for the fourth quarter. Our business is getting stronger quarter by quarter and of course we all recall how tough things were in last year's fourth quarter. Therefore the year on year growth rates will be very good. The $1.30 was ahead of expectations driven by strong sales growth and by relentless commitment to managing our costs. I will cover these details in a few charts. Full year earnings per share were $4.52 on a reported basis and $4.69 adjusted for special items which are largely related to restructuring actions undertake it in the first nine months of this year. To pick up on something that George alluded to, our original expected range of earnings for 2009 was $4.50 to $4.95. But we had a few ups and downs then and now in the end we posted a $4.69 per share right near the midpoint of our original range. Very few industrial companies can make that claim. So, my hat is off to our leadership team for once again getting the job done. Please be aware that in 2010 borrowing any very large or unusual items we will be presenting our numbers to you each quarter primarily on a GAAP reported basis. Likewise our estimates of future earnings are on a GAAP reported basis as well. Please turn to slide five for a deeper look at sales. Sales increased over 11% year on year and the growth was very broad based. Every geographic region expand the sales with notable performances in Asia Pacific at 22% and Latin America and Canada each at 19%. We experienced double digit sales increases in nearly all business segments led by displaying graphics at 19% and safety security and protection at 13.5%. Organic volumes grew 4.4% in the fourth quarter driven by strong demand for optical films and respiratory protection products. This result should be significantly better than worldwide IPI which is currently estimated at a negative 1.7% by global insight. Organic volumes rose nearly 19% in Asia Pacific. As Korea, China and Taiwan posted the most dramatic increases driven by a combination of improved local demand along with the pick up in global electronics. Selling prices rose 1.1%, so we effectively held on to price increases enacted one year ago. Asia post the selling price declines in the quarter which is of course skewed by our strong electronics oriented businesses were priced down as a given but net-net we grow through higher volumes. Acquisitions added a point to growth in Q4 and currency impacts turn favorable at plus 4.8%. Now please turn to slide number six where I will review key elements of the fourth quarter income statement. By any measure, Q4 performance was a very good one. Sales grew to. 11.1% to $6.1 billion, net income rose by 38% and operating margins were 21.9%. This is a remarkable performance by our global teams and a testament to the resiliency of our very unique business model. Gross profit improved 18% year-on-year and gross margins improve by almost three whole points to 47.9%. Factory utilization accounted for half of the improvement as fourth quarter production volumes improved. Customer downtime was certainly much better than the in the fourth quarter of 2008, when many of our customers chose to shutdown for much of December. Selling prices were again positive which boosted gross margin by 50 basis points. Raw materials were down slightly versus Q4 of last year adding approximately 30 basis points to our margin. Fourth quarter gross margins also benefitted from cost reduction actions which frankly began in early 2008, and continued throughout 2009. Looking forward, the challenge now is to only add cost to the extent that they drive additional growth. SG&A costs increased 7%, driven by a higher advertising and merchandising investments along with higher compensation costs related to improved year-on-year company performance. As a percent of sales SG&A declined by 60 basis points. R&D spending was down just slightly versus the fourth quarter last year, impacted by company-wide cost reduction efforts. We did however; maintain investments in our key growth programs. Operating income rose 38% to $1.3 billion. And operating margins were robust 21.9%. The fourth quarter tax rate was 26.8%, down 80 basis points versus Q4 last year; due to a lower international tax rate and a completion of certain tax audits. This result is inline with our expectations and a strategy of bringing our tax rate down over time. Sequential P&L highlights were shown on slide number seven. Fourth quarter sales were down just slightly versus the third which is a better result than we would have expected to see in a normal year. Typically, the third quarter stronger than the fourth as customers build inventory for the holidays and consumer offers and electronics. In addition, Q4 sales in construction related businesses like traffic safety and roofing granules tend to decline due to colder weather. 2009 was different in that fourth quarter sales improved sequentially in both industrial and transportation and electro and communications which suggest some underlying improvement. Of course, these businesses were hardest hit by the global recession so they have some ground to recover. Health care improved sequentially as well. Gross margins declined 1.3% sequentially, largely driven by lower factory utilization and mix. The mix impact is likely to continue in the 2010, as businesses like Industrial and Transportation and Electro and communications are likely to pickup as the economy improves and they have slightly lower than average gross margins. Fourth quarter SG&A spending was up $56 million. Largely sales and marketing related including a 30% increase in advertising and promotional investments. R&D was down just slightly. Operating income was off 10.8% and net income declined 3.7%. Please turn to slide number eight. Its certainly is easier to get overly focused on quarterly results these days given what has happened to the economy in the past year. But we managed our company for a long term success. So it seems appropriate that quickly review a full year highlights. Although 2009 sales declined 8.5% with volumes down 9.5%, the decline was right inline with the overall economy. Our new product vitality index which major sales for products introduced in the last five years was 29% in 2009, up four points year-on-year. So, we are continuing to gain momentum on the innovation front. We managed our expenses very carefully in 2009. For example, we restructured a number of businesses during the past two years resulting in calendar year savings of almost $400 million. In addition, we amended our policy regarding bankification which added $100 million plus to the bottom line. We also enacted temporary furloughs, froze merit pay and reduced in direct spending by 14%. All things considered our business teams did a tremendous job in a very tough environment. Finally in the midst of this economic storm, we invested $1.3 billion in R&D up slightly as percent of sales. We continue to support our key larger programs but overall spending was impacted by our company-wide cost initiatives such as in direct spending reduction and obligation policy change. So on aggregate, we delivered 21.7% operating margins equal to 2008. I believe this was truly an outstanding performance for the organization. Please turn to slide number nine. Even more impressive than our earnings results in 2009 was our free cash flow conversion and balance sheet performance, which was one of our primary objectives going into these tough economic times. We intensified efforts in late 2008 to drive our working capital and improve our capital discipline. These efforts paid off as we delivered record free cash flow of $4 billion, up $1 billion or 32% over 2008. Full year free cash flow conversion was 126%. For the fourth quarter, free cash flow was $770 million up 16% year-on-year. Free cash flow conversion was 82% in the quarter, impacted by discretionary pension contributions of more than $400 million in the fourth quarter. Although, not shown on the chart, our global pension plans at year end were 90% funded with the U.S. qualified plan at 96% and our international plans at 83%. Asset returns in the U.S. qualified plan were 12.6% and the discount rates finished at 5.77% down 37 basis points from 2008. But the actual asset return performance and discount rates are better than what we assumed in December at our outlook meeting. Looking ahead, we expect to contribute between $500 million and $700 million to our global pension plans in 2010. Pension expense will increase by approximately $130 million pre-tax or $0.12 per share. For your modeling purposes, the additional pension costs increase will be booked almost entirely incorporate and unallocated. Since we incurred a 2009 GAAP reported loss of a $100 million incorporate and unallocated, 2010 will be a loss closer to $200 million. Improved working capital performances was a big driver of our free cash flow. Inventories declined by $374 million and turns improved from 3.8 to 4.6 for the year. (inaudible) turns improved from 6.9 to 7.5 at the end of 2009. This is a record result for 3M and the fact that we did this during a difficult economy makes it even more impressive. Capital expenditures for the year came in at $903 million right inline with our expectations. We expect 2010 CapEx to be approximately $1 billion. The strong capital discipline resulted in net debt of $1.1 billion, down $3 billion from one year ago. As cash and marketable securities increased by $2 billion and debt was actually reduced by $1 billion. Dividends paid to common shareholders was $361 million in the fourth quarter and $1.4 billion for the year. Now let's review the performance of our business units. Please turn to slide number 10. The health care business is an absolute jewel in our portfolio, which we highlighted in our December meeting in Europe. With nicely growing end markets that are highly stable. Fourth quarter sales in health care were $1.1 billion up nearly 11% in dollars and up 6% in local currency. Foreign exchange impacts at nearly 5% of fourth quarter sales. Sales increased in every business within health care, most notably in the infection prevention, skin and wound care and health information systems. Looking at sales by geography, sales grew in all major areas led by Canada, Latin America and Asia Pacific. Fourth quarter operating income rose 26% to $375 million, driven by favorable product mix, good cost control and continued productivity efforts across the portfolio. Looking at a few highlights, orthodontic products rebounded nicely after weathering economic storms of late. And in our infection prevention business Popular Science magazine awarded 3M the grand award in the health care category along with a 2009 \"Innovation of the Year\" across all categories for a recently launched 3M Littmann 3200 Electronic Stethoscope. Health care is once again driving innovation in a big way. For the full year sales worth $4.3 billion up 3.6% in local currencies and again broad base infection prevention and skin and wound care led the way with a multitude of products that improved patient treatment outcomes and an increased efficiency for health care providers. We also drove positive local currency sales growth in the oral care business. A great result considering the poor economy. On a regional basis, growth rates were the highest in Asia Pacific, Latin America and Canada. Full year profits in health care grew 11% to $1.4 billion as team continues to drive operational excellence and outstanding productivity day in and day out. Operating margins were 31.9% in 2009 and as we have mentioned before, our longer term plan is to keep reinvesting in this business to drive higher growth even if margins at some point compress perhaps the high 20s. We made several such investments in 2009. For example, our drug delivery systems business entered the large and growing (white) powdered inhalation segment. In wound care we strengthened our market leadership in clear wound dressings with new products for IV sites and chronic wound care. Dental launch a number of new products including new decay preventive (excellence) curing wise and impression material systems. In health information systems we continue to launch solutions for the new ICD-10 coding, in-patient and outpatient medical record coding, reimbursement and data connectivity. And finally, we opened or expanded major new R&D and manufacturing facilities around the world including China, Singapore, India and Brazil. Please turn to slide number 11 where I will discuss the consumer and office business. Fourth quarter sales in this business were $887 million, up 11.4% in dollar terms and up 7.1% in local currencies. A number of businesses posted positive local currency growth including double digit gains and home care products and retail health care and single digit growth and do it yourself and mass retail. The consumer office team has executed a successful bolt on acquisition strategy over the past couple of years and acquisitions contributed 3.7% to this quarter's growth. Two recent deals drove the growth mainly Futuro, a leading supplier of braces supports and compression hosiery along with Ace products one of the great consumer health care brands. These investments combined with their own successful brands, give us important critical mass and the retail drug channel. This leadership team has a long and very successful history of growth in the United States. Be a strong category defining brands and outstanding customer relationships and we are leveraging this success outside the U.S. as well. In fact, in the fourth quarter, sales rose 20% in Latin America, 14% in Asia Pacific, and 8% in Europe. Profits rose in all geographic regions as well. Fourth quarter profits and consumer office were up 31% to $159 million with margins of 17.9%. Full year 2009 sales were $3.5 billion down 3% which was largely currency driven. Margins were a solid 21.9% for the year, up over two points versus 2008. This business does a fabulous job of creating new products and designing new programs with customers who drive growth and profitability. Most recently we won a number of 2009 good design awards including the Scotch easy grip tape dispenser, Post-it Flag pens and highlighters and Scotch Pop-Up Tape Dispensers among others. Product design is often is important to the customer as functionality or price in value. Which is why many years ago we invested in a product design center in Italy to ensure that our products have the look and feel the customers demand. Finally, as George mentioned at our December meeting in New York, we recently launched a complete line of adhesive back labels for the office market. Early indications are favorable and their business is beginning to gain good traction with our customers. Now let's turn to slide 12. Displaying graphics was a bright spot in the fourth quarter, as sales increased nearly 19% to $817 million. Sales grew 15.7% of local currency and foreign exchange impacts added just over 3 points to growth. Operating profits more than doubled to $141 million. Optical films continue grow nicely in Q4 with sales up over 50% year on year. Innovation was the key driver as our recent film technology break through effectively improves the energy efficiency of an LCD panel went over 30% and can greatly simplify its design. Sales of these films accelerated in the second and third quarter of this year and although fourth quarter sales declined sequentially due to normal seasonal patterns year on year growth rates were very impressive. Optical is a great business for 3M, but there is no doubt that will remain intensively competitive going forward. Our OEM customers continue to drive price reductions and we will need to respond with continued aggressive cost reduction and productivity in order to fund needed new products. Our customers want technical solutions to solve their problems and we will be there to help them when they do. Fourth quarter local currency sales were up slightly in traffic safety systems driven by the December of 2008 acquisition of a French license plate provider. Sales in the commercial graphics business were flat sequentially and down year-over-year as advertising spending remains soft. However the business did stabilize around year end indicating some potential positive momentum. For the full year sales declined 4% to $3.1 billion and our profit declined 2% to $612 million. Operating margins were nearly 20%. The business here continues to work aggressively to accelerate long-term growth. For example, we recently formed a new architectural market business to expand our footprint in film solutions for interior surfaces and for energy efficient lighting solutions. We also formed a new mobile interactive solutions business to develop products that will improve projection, personalization and privacy for mobile device users. In addition, the business recently announced a unique optical film that enables 3-D viewing on handheld devices without need for 3-D glasses. Finally we are preparing to launch this third and then in a family of pocket projectors. The MPro 150 which projects high quality images up to 50 inches. This projector is 50% brighter than the MPro 100 launched a year ago and 25% brighter than the 120 launched in September. We are pitching this new product as the ultimate tool for mobile professionals with a number of compatible applications including PowerPoint, excel and word. The projector also handles multiple video formats. It really is the ultimate all in one entertainment and business tool. We got few minutes feedback on the MPro of 150 of the most recent CES show in Las Vegas and it will be available for purchase in just a few weeks. Please turn to slide 13. And safety, security and protection services sales grew 13.5% in the fourth quarter largely driven by a personal protection business. 3M is the global leader in the safety market especially in respiratory protection products. In May of 2009 we began to see a surge in orders for respirators approved for use and defending against the H1N1 virus. Since that time demand has continued to exceeded available supply. We estimate that this added about $80 million to the fourth quarter sales in this business and about $95 million for 3M in total. Last quarter we approved respiratory manufacturing investments in Singapore and the U.S. with capacity ramping up in January and targeted for completion by the end of the second quarter. Elsewhere within this segment local currency sales growth was slightly positive in our building and commercial business driven by a number of new product introductions but all other businesses posted lower sales. We saw a double digit currency declines in our industrial oriented corrosion protection business and in the businesses linked to residential construction namely roofing (granules). Fourth quarter operating profit increased over 50% and margins were healthy 24.3%. Sales and local currency rose 7.9%. And foreign exchange impacts added 5.6% to fourth quarter sales. Full year 2009 safety and securities sales totaled $3.2 billion down 7.8% in dollar terms and 2.7% in local currencies. We drove positive local currency growth and personal protection products but all other businesses were down. The global recession took a toll on our industrial and construction related businesses within this segment. Despite the sales decline, operating profits remain flat versus 2008 and margins rose by almost two points to 23.5%. Please turn to slide 14 for looking at our largest segments industrial and transportation. This is a very large and diversified set of businesses that in aggregate correlate well with the broad industrial economy. Sales declines early in 2009 led to swift and aggressive restructuring and cost reduction plans to offset lower volumes, on top of that where large inventory reductions in the whole sale distribution channel. Inventories began to stabilize around mid-year and it now appears that inventory and point of sale levels are in reasonably good balance. Sales and industrial transportation rose 10% to $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter. Year on year local currency growth was 4.6% which included organic volume growth of 3%. This is a great result considering industrial production is expected to be in negative in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter local currency growth was led by a renewable energy business at 40% and our automotive OEM business which grew almost 19%. We also drove positive local currency sales growth in Industrial adhesives and tapes. Automotive aftermarket and our businesses supplies (inaudible) into the oil and gas and transportation industries. Other businesses in the segment posted mid-single digit, local currency sales declines in Q4. On a regional basis, growth was strongest in Latin America and Asia, where our China business grew at three times the rate of industrial production. The combination of better sales volumes higher year-on-year production levels and a best in class cost structure resulted in outstanding Q4 profit growth of 59%. Margins improved by 6.4% to 20.8%. I doubt you'll see better numbers this quarter from any of our industrial peers. Full year 2009 sales were $7.1 billion down 12.9% in dollars and down 10.2% in local currency. Foreign currency impacts hurt sales by 2.7%. Operating profits were $1.3 billion and operating margins were 18.6%. In addition to driving outstanding results this past year, industrial transportation business continued to invest aggressively to accelerate its growth capability. For example, our renewable energy business recently opened a large scale high-tech manufacturing site in Singapore and industrial bases opened new state of the art manufacturing site in North America. Recently 3M purification systems launched a high quality disposable filtration system for the biopharmaceutical industry. And finally, our automotive aftermarket business introduced 3M Dirt Trap Protection System which increases paint booth productivity and reduces daily maintenance costs in auto body repair shops. I cannot say enough about the incredible job this team has done to fundamentally reinvent its business. Innovation and growth are once again top of mind. And this business knows how to drive out cost. Prioritize the best opportunities and execute their plans. Please turn to slide 15 where I'll summarize results for the electro and communications business. This business continues to get to gather momentum in the fourth quarter with sales up 1.7% sequentially, bucking our normal trend of sequential fourth quarter decline. The growth was led by our businesses that supply the consumer electronics and the semiconductor industries. On the flip side, our infrastructure related businesses and telecommunications and commercial construction remains soft in Q4. Fourth quarter sales increased 4.6% to $628 million. Local currency sales were up 1.4%, again led by electronics and semiconductor related businesses. We saw a number of value added and highly innovative materials and solutions into these large and important end markets. Electro and communications relentlessly drove productivity again in the fourth quarter posting nearly 14% operating margins. This margin was nearly four times that of the first quarter. The team deserves tremendous credit in driving efficiencies to offset what has been an extremely challenging global business environment. At the same time the team has recently developed and introduced a number of new products including solutions for touch enabled mobile handheld devices and smartphones. Other recent launches include electrically conductive optically clear adhesives, wafer handling systems for semiconductor manufacturing, a new line of high voltage terminations and splices for new 3G closures and cross connect blocks for telecommunications applications. Sales for the full year 2009 were $2.3 billion down 19.7%, the local currency sales declining 17.8% and foreign currency reducing sales by 1.7%. Operating income for the year was $3 million and margins were 14.6 %. All things considered, our electro communications business had a very successful year. We are encouraged by the steady sales improvement and by the great progress and streamline of cost structure. We look for continued improvement throughout 2010. That concludes my review of the fourth quarter numbers and the full year. Now I'll return it back to George who will describe our outlook for 2010. Please turn to slide 16.\nGeorge Buckley: Before we get to your questions, I would like to address our outlook for the rest of year. Frankly, not a great deal has materially changed since our December outlook meeting. But I'm pleased to say that here and there things have hedged to little more positive than we saw in early December. Of course, as you expect from us, we will maintain our typical conservative stands on these things. You think over the years our increasing experience would teach us how to forecast the next year ever better. But it seems that each of these past few ones have been as deeply mysterious and clouded as its predecessor. Therefore, context recognizing that I'm an engineer and anything I can't forecast exactly is considered by me to be mysterious anyway. In all seriousness, there are lots of moving parts again in the world economy with a complex mix of factors driving different parts of the world economy up, down or sideways. We try to sort them out in a balanced way in arriving at our consensus view. As I said to you in New York in December, the challenge of forecasting is always hardest around turning points or if you like whether it changes ingredients such as peaks, valleys or points of inflection. That's what we have here in 2010. Let's not be fooled by the arithmetic magic of year-over-year comparisons. For most companies if we index to 2007 major economies and companies still have a lot of digging out to do. I mentioned in New York, there are five things which affect our sales in any one year. First, performance of the end markets. Second, supply chain filling and emptying. Three, X-factors. Four, creation of new markets, via product releases and five, share gains. Some of these are going to be positive in 2010 and some a little negative or perhaps at least uncertain. For example, I think share gains and new product growth should be positive. X-factors of course remain X-factors. Supply chain (filling) should be neutral or positive and blended end market neutral or marginally positive. As Pat mentioned, there are headwinds in pension and possibly price and labor costs. Stimulus packages to the extent that they made much difference outside of China will be negative. But taken all-in-all this paints us slightly more positive picture than heretofore. But (inaudible) anywhere could afford to take their eye off this bouncing economic ball. In terms of specific markets, health care will remain positive. As will renewable energy, occupational health, security and LCD TVs. I don't expect much positive news in residential housing, commercial construction or automotive. Consumer markets will likely to grow slightly for us, but by new product innovations in air filtration and labels and perhaps water, too. So, we have a split of positives and still negative market news but with the positives nudging out the negatives overall. The only market that might get remarkably worse in the United States is commercial construction and our presence there is not that large. Let's remind ourselves again of (inaudible) view there will be no sustainable recovery without lateral improvements in aggregate end market demand, longer term that\u2019s what must happen. And clearly we have not seen those improvements yet in the United States or Europe to any significant degree. Asia on the other hand has improved nicely with China and India growing rapidly again so absent any economic retrenchment in those areas we will get some additional lift internationally. As I said the December meeting, unemployment seems to be the key determinative of what happens next in the United States. The danger is being deceived by the potential illusion of falling unemployment rates which might occur only because people losing benefits faster than new entrance of joining the unemployment roles. So, while we might be through the worst of the tempest, we are still sailing in some very choppy economic waters. As we demonstrated in the recent quarters, this past one included. This kind of overall economic picture is by no mean is bad news for 3M. With great cash flow, high margins and powerful balance sheet with some choices some of the companies don't. So the current conditions present as an opportunity to continue and even to accelerate key investments and to press forward aggressively to gain market share from our competitors. We can finance our growth internally and we are not dependent on external resources that might get tighter, rarer or more expensive. Of course, we still stay consistent with our core plan of controlling costs, generating cash, and ethically driving sales. I think 3M business leaders and managers have done a wonderful job this year and proven their ability to navigate the worst of the turbulence well. We are moving more forcefully to drive growth again through new products by managing the full spread of the market pyramid through new acquisitions and of course pushing ourselves forward internationally. The excellent news is that our sales growth momentum continues. End markets internationally are part of this and we are getting some lift from translation tool. Organic growth is still higher than one might expect from these factors. So it does appear that the new product push is paying dividends that we are gaining some share on new markets are being created. So given this recent performance and our growth trajectory, we are now working with an improved planning frame for 2010 of EPS of $4.90 to $5.10 which is an increase over 2009 of eight to 13%. This improvement over our December 8 numbers is held by a lower pension head wind. Our 2010 planning framework includes an organic sales volume of plus 5% to plus 7% with faster growth naturally occurring in the first half of the year due to some easier year-over-year comparisons. We expect currency effects to be positive bringing about another 1% to 2% point in sales lift compared with our previous estimate in December of plus 2% to plus 3%. We have been successful in holding operating margins in the 21% to 22% range. And we expect that pattern to continue in 2010. But the great news here is that within these figures we will be accelerating our investments in new business ventures overseas growth and R&D are over $100 million. This new economic fuel is going to (stove) the growth fires if not all of this seen in 2010 it should be felt in 2011. Assuming there are no changes in tax policy by the U.S. federal government, we anticipate an effective tax rate of 28% to 29% for 2010. And finally we expect shares outstanding to fall somewhere in the range of $721 million to $725 million. We shall most certainly be doing our best to make 2010 a banner year where the previous heavy (inaudible) in investments pay off for us all. And with that I would like to turn the call over to you for questions. Thank you very much for listening.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Hi, good morning guys.\nPat Campbell: Good morning Scott.\nScott Davis: Can we talk a little bit about guidance and the timing of some of the cost that may come back, it looks like you are expecting a pretty good leverage off of that sales volume. But you did cut advertising expense a little bit in 2010 and had some benefit from vacation policy changes. Are there costs or timing or sequential timing issues that we should think about?\nPat Campbell: Yes, Scott, I can't think of anything major, on the vacation front, we will have a little less benefit in 10 than we had in 9 but nothing too significant. I wasn't exactly clear on your comment of book cutting at advertising merchandise. If anything we are going the other way. We are actually increasing our adverse spending. We ramped it up in the back half of this year. I think you saw it in the fourth quarter a big piece of that is in the consumer business both domestically and internationally. So those increases will continue into our 10 plan.\nScott Davis: Okay. That's good clarification. Can we talk a little bit about China? You are throwing up some pretty big growth rates there and maybe it will be helpful for background to understand your business mix. I know this is your folks out there but it's my understanding that big chunk of that is auto and auto has been strong in China so it helps explain. Maybe start with the business mix then talk to us about whether you are gaining share in China or have more product selling into the region you have establish yourself more or weather there is a restock, just a little bit of color please on China?\nPat Campbell: Yes, I will and I kind of anticipated that a number of people are concerned about kind of recent news coming out of China relative trying to slow things down. George and we just happen to be there last week so we kind of have a fresh view on things, I must say the business there is performing very, very well and even into the first part of this year. Our China business, so paying by how you define it if you took kind of the mainland China probably through Hong Kong and it\u2019s about 5% to 6% of our revenue base. As you would expect in China, our business is heavily focused around industrial and infrastructure related businesses at this point in time. So, our consumer business and our health care business would be smaller pieces of the portfolio (inaudible) be the companywide average which is only natural for a country like China as it continues to grow economically. So most of our businesses there, our larger businesses are around industrial related, automotive is a big market for us as well. But think of it heavily around the infrastructure as well as there is a lot of electronics businesses that are migrating to China as well. A lot of the optical systems business is migrating to China as well, not necessarily for local consumption but for export purposes. And generally speaking our strategy in China, Scott, to remind you is very much a China for China strategy. We, other than the optical systems business where we are effectively following our customers, most of our business there is really been developed for local needs. And as George pointed out in his presentation, the lab that we have in China is just absolutely phenomenal and on fire relative to new product development relative to really developing local products for the local market. My sense is that still in China we are under penetrated where we need to be. So we can we still have very significant growth opportunities and for those of you who attended New York's meeting in December, (inaudible) you talk about our strategy for China which was kind of a very much an accelerated ramp up there.\nGeorge Buckley: You can imagine we pursued at this point when Pat and I were in China last week. And the opinion of people on the ground there is the Chinese government is dealing with this very thoughtfully. Yes, they are trying to call demand and for some people to get concerned about asset bubbles and then of course you Cascade that into worrying whether same sort of thing could happen there that happened here. But the profile of the consumer is very different than it is here. People put very large deposits down on houses. They are much more conservative with their spending and their savings ratios and much, much higher than what you see in the United States. So I think the consumer end of the equation, we are unlikely to see much in the way of any real trouble. On commercial construction, there is some concern that maybe some of those assets have gotten inflated. Chinese government is successful in the actions that they are taking, and nearly these guys so far have proven time and time again whether it's in growth, whether it\u2019s in restocking their economy, that they are very, very smart. We meet a lot of the community leaders, and industrial leaders and government leaders there and what is beginning to happen progressively is they are staffing those positions with superbly well educated people, extremely able folks. And certainly heretofore I think they have proven that they know how to manage this particular situation and I think at this juncture our assessment is that the risk is not that great.\nScott Davis Scott Davis: Okay. Thanks guys. I will jump in or I will call afterwards and let other people jump in.\nPat Campbell: Okay, thanks Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nDeane Dray: Thank you, good morning everyone.\nPat Campbell: Good morning Deane.\nDeane Dray: And George, it was nice to hear that you're still somewhat in the economic forecasting business here, I do appreciate your thoughts about the recovery path. Now you mentioned this twice, so, I wanted to follow up on it is you grouped 3M markets, residential, auto and commercial construction, I see you weren't expecting much in the way of a lift. Now I wouldn't think you would say that I would agree that you would say that about commercial construction, that's a small piece by maybe 2% our estimates. But both residential and auto had that element of early cycle and you do have some sizable exposure to auto OE and aftermarket, maybe its split 12% total, 6 each. So, why would you not be seeing a bit of a lift maybe some restocking, higher auto production. Why would those not be seeing that benefit as well?\nGeorge Buckley: Well, my logic Deane was really tied off the unemployment. Obviously I'm speaking specifically about the United States when I make those references. China and India are seeing sort of rocket shift growth in some of those segments. So, I'm really speaking about the United States. I think, I don't know if I should say pessimism but caution at the very least is tied there to the unemployment rates. And I'm just of the mind that until I see some here and there minor improvements in the unemployment picture, I'm going to be cautious on those two segments. I think you are right Deane that given where inventories are and I track those and Pat does, we all do, it does appear that some of the inventory drawdown in the United States in a number of different segments is kind of reaching bottom. We were seeing a little bit of pickup here and there. So, maybe in the coming quarter or two quarters we might see some restocking. But in terms of end market demand, I am kind of taking a cautious view on those market segments in particular. I don't expect them to get worse by the way Deane. So, I'm not in any way forecasting that they are going to go down. I'm expecting them to go side ways or they may get lifted through restocking. But generally speaking kind of a sideways motion maybe some benefit from restocking but not any sort of appreciable change in the overall pattern in those marketplaces in the United States.\nDeane Dray: And then just as a follow-up, where would you expect to see the restocking occur for those? And before we were thinking electronics in Asia perhaps but has your thinking changed there?\nGeorge Buckley: No. I think electronics some people were forecasting Armageddon a year ago. But what's happened when you look at fab utilization rates they just shot back up from numbers in the 30s to numbers in the 80s. So that looks all very good and I think the overall just a general industrial spaces in the United States will probably begin to restock a little bit here, Deane. I kind of made some comments on that in my remarks. Obviously, I'm bound to think that Asia is going to be in front. The United States a little bit behind, Western Europe a little bit behind that, and Eastern Europe a little bit behind them. Latin America though probably and certainly we saw really good growth in the fourth quarter, we will probably pop back more quickly simply because their economy is more internal. Pat mentioned the kind of China for China. Well, in a sense we are following the Latin America for Latin America, China for China, India for India kind of strategy. We are not really dependent in those markets being of a lot of exports. And as they naturally improve through their own sort of efforts. We remain quite positive about those markets. And of course, we had just wonderful improvements in the renewable energy area. You always wonder how long those social things can last, how many years will that go on for? But nevertheless it's really bringing us some very, very nice growth right now. As are the other sort of energy sensitive energy related kind of markets in films both the Windows as well as LCD. So, the health care is not going to do really anything that different than this year. It may actually begin to pickup a little bit with some restocking there, because there was some destocking that took place in that market, too Deane. So, in overall despite my caution in residential construction and automotive, there are more positive signs in these other areas and we test very, very hard amongst ourselves about this issue of gaining share. Of course it's what you want to happen and you want to believe it but you have to prove it, too. So, these early numbers do suggest that we are gaining some share. And if you think about this in pure arithmetic numbers, we have about 9% market share, and markets around the world even 1% market share gain is a 20% growth. So share gain is going to be a big factor I think this year. Obviously, it will start off with lower numbers and we hope to accelerate the higher ones. But all-in-all, I think we were far better equipped, Deane. The economy isn't going to get worse. It is naturally going to gradually improve in this cyclic way these things do. So, I'm not predicting any sort of great resurgence. But I think we are going to see steady improvements and as the year goes forward we will be all over this to take advantage of it.\nPat Campbell: Yeah, Dean. Just one thing I would add on the automotive side is I would expect that probably the first quarter this year-on-year comps are so easy. Okay, that they more will be bad. I think the wild card here is number of governments spend a fair amount of money on stimulus around cash for clunkers last year. Its unclear okay, if that will continue. So that actually could be a okay, a significant headwind on a global basis. But I think from a timing standpoint earlier in the year because the comps are easy we will be probably okay. I think it should be the question is later in the year where will the demand kind of rise? And obviously the cost we have on both autos and housing is to make sure people don't think that this going to return to where it was. That we believe there is going to be a permanent reset in both of those markets.\nGeorge Buckley: On automotive aftermarket, Deane that business has really done quite well this year. I don't suggest it's in anyway impervious to the economy but it certainly less sensitive to the economy than the automotive OEM business. So, we are kind of encouraged by that one and expect quite a bit of growth here in the U.S. but particularly in Asia we expect that. And so I think in that area in particular the news is mostly good.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Citi Investment Research. Please proceed.\nJeff Sprague: We have done a lot of macro. Let me kind of drill down into a couple of businesses if you don't mind. First on optical, George or Pat, could you just give a sense of kind of the state of play on the evolution of competition if we think about trying to guard against ultimate (communization) of DBEF given what will happen with DBEF? Do you see the forces marshaling against there may be some comment on your lead? And this 3D technology that you are talking about sounds very interesting. Is there a reason why it only applies to handheld devices? Or is that something that can apply to flat screen televisions and things like that with some more work?\nGeorge Buckley: Let me have a poke at that if I can, please. On the sustainability of that model, our patents are pretty solid for the next couple of years. So, we get some insulation from that. But in any market we both know, we all know who were on this call that the competition is always going to try to follow markets which appear to be growing faster or have a decent earnings capability. But I think when you think about what's going on in the LCD TV market in particular, prices have gone down of units, I think the high grey (inaudible) days are gone. Doesn't mean you can't make design money. So I think this sort of incentive to be drawn to this market is a little lower today than it was say four or even five years ago. On the BEF versus DBEF comparisons, the manufacturing challenges that DBEF is far greater, orders of magnitude more difficult than it would be for DBEF. On the other hand, there are some great manufacturers around. I'm sure would try to have a bite at that business. But I don't see the sort of everybody coming out of the woodworks kind of competitive response in DBEF that we saw in BEF. So I think it\u2019s a little more insulated Jeff than that was. On the other hand, let's also be realistic. You never seem to be more than a year or a year and a half from de-contenting in this business. So the kind of reports that we have taken strategically is to work genuinely, really hard to get ever more close to the customers to work on specific innovation for them. And even during the toughest of times these folks always remarked if ever we want innovation the only people we really can turn to is 3M. We have a value proposition for there people that are very sustainable long term. Nevertheless, all-in-all I think you can't keep on taking content out to televisions until they cost nothing. And the approach that we have taken is basically to take a look at building material of monitors, of laptops or LCD TVs and basically say, okay, what do we got in our portfolio of ideas and products that we can apply to these products to take out content? So, we are part and parcel of the charge to take out cost and make these businesses successful. All-in-all in summary I'm less concerned about DBEF than I was about BEF. I just hope that my forecast here turns out to be right.\nJeff Sprague: Great. And on the 3D technology?\nGeorge Buckley: Sorry, Jeff I forgot about that. On the 3D technology we started off in cameras. That was our sort of first launch with one of the Japanese camera manufacturers. There is now interest in this for gaming and even for televisions. It's early to predict exactly where this market will go, but it's a unique technology and I think it's got some legs for sometime. Although probably not I mean, I think it will, to be honest with Jeff probably will be and I\u2019m guessing that this is a guesstimate, little bit more that sort of a 10% piece of that TV puzzle that will be my educated guess.\nJeff Sprague: Okay.\nPat Campbell: Jeff, the other thing I was going to add on the kind of the LCD story is of course there has been quite a movement here on LED at the same time. And we have a very, very good value proposition on the LED side. So, as George points out that you kind of take this design by design. You never take anything for granted but we think we were in reasonably good position here for the near term.\nJeff Sprague: And then just one on health care and I will pass for the time. Pat, I think it was your phrase in Q1 I was running hot at 31.2% margins and every quarter in '09 has actually been higher. I assume some of that is mixed, but can you just kind of address the dynamics in health care margins and kind of what we should expect going forward?\nPat Campbell: Jeff, good question. Brad and his team have a kind of an amazing portfolio there that it kind of reviewed in the December meeting. The way of course you bring margins down in that business is obviously our level of investment in the business and so what we are staging here is looking at what kind of product pipeline they have and then looking at the degree that we want to fund new investment options that we have accelerated that over this past year. Interesting model though because Brad and his team have done just such a marvelous job on ongoing productivity work as well that it would be more profitable business over time. But there is a little bit of a mix advantage kind of going on in the business right now some of the businesses that have held up our stronger than the others from a profit margin standpoint.\nJeff Sprague: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Terry Darling of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nTerry Darling: Thanks. Good morning.\nPat Campbell: Good morning Terry.\nTerry Darling of Goldman Sachs: Pat, I\u2019m wondering recognizing you don't give first quarter guidance but I just thought that it might be helpful for all parties here to pickup qualitatively about any big sequential movers. Obviously the corporate line is going up for all of the reasons that you have talked about tax goes up a little bit. But any other kind of seasonal items in the businesses or things like your advertising spending rate? Things like that you want to call out for us?\nPat Campbell: I guess Terry, the only thing I want to remind everybody is that the way our stock optioning expense flows through the year because our grant is in February, we get a much heavier hit in the first quarter and I think we scale that probably $40 million, $50 million higher in the first quarter. So, as people are thinking of their first quarter estimates they are I make sure that they dial that in. That\u2019s not a change from last year, it's a change from a couple years ago. But that's only thing that I see, we will be seeing commodity prices are starting to rise. So, I think maybe I will get through the first quarter a little bit or maybe part way through the first quarter but we will start to see some pressure on material costs. Now of course our purchasing guys are trying to find new offsets to that but we could see a little pressure in the first quarter.\nTerry Darling of Goldman Sachs: Okay and then coming back to the earlier question on optical. I think your comps are very easy in the first quarter. Does that drive display and graphic organic up a lot sequentially?\nPat Campbell: Yes. Well, yes. Probably it maybe a little bit sequentially but definitely on a year-over-year basis Terry optical will be a lot higher because the first quarter was a terrible period for us last year in that business. So, we saw on a year-over-year basis it will be up and actually that industry has maintained a fair amount of discipline in this past year. So, probably see more of a normal trend there.\nTerry Darling of Goldman Sachs: You know, I think you called out optical up 50% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. I missed weather that was local currency. Can you calibrate us as to where that ended up on the full year and maybe within the context of 2010 what you are assuming there?\nPat Campbell: I\u2019ll be honest, I think for the full year, I think our business is just up slightly for the full year because we had the first half of the year was a difficult period and then of course that business came on strong starting in Q2. But on an all in basis the sales of that business are just up slightly for the whole year.\nTerry Darling of Goldman Sachs: And for ten, should we be thinking kind of moderate to low double digits or something better than that?\nPat Campbell: It actually, we are expecting that business will perform very well. Now if I look at the D&G business in total, which optical is imbedded in, that was one of our higher growth rate businesses that we reviewed in December primarily as we expect that there should be some recovery in the traffic signs and commercial graphics has kind of in a difficult period that maybe they have got a little bit of a momentum as well.\nTerry Darling of Goldman Sachs: Okay and then just coming back to the second half organic indications on the outlook slide for the whole company, I'm just trying to think 2% to 4% second half organic recognizing your commentary about being conservative, but trying to map that back to the December meeting with you are talking about taking organic for the whole company up 7 to 8. Is that comps are getting tougher timing of new products, can you just flush out why we decelerate below that kind of longer term organic growth target that you are talking about in the second half?\nPat Campbell: Terry it's like three quarters away, okay. So, that's probably as much as anything reflection we think in the first part of this year the one for comp purposes and two the momentum we got we feel pretty good about it. Let's face it, I only gave us as a crystal ball okay, so how the back half of this year is going to play out. Some of the pundits basically are concerned about the back half may not be as strong. So as we put our plan together, what we are basically indicating is we need to get off to a very, very rapid start here in Q1 and Q2. And position us for whatever happens in the back half of the year. I think it will be probably fair to say Terry, that we probably have a more conservative view in the back half of the year.\nGeorge Buckley: I also think Terry, just let me chip in. This year is the year of transition where you got kind of easy comps at the beginning year and other comps at the end of the year. Your net-net, I don't think the numbers probably going to be a lot different than what you suggested. And honestly that normal run rate that number that we quoted you is what we expect. You are bound to see quarter over quarter bumpiness when you got to hear of transition lot this one is from a terrible year last year.\nTerry Darling of Goldman Sachs: I understood. And then I guess lastly just wondering talking about things are a little bit better since December you have raised guidance. It doesn't seem like the guidance is really assuming a step up in sort of balance sheet deployment 6% net debt to cap in the fourth quarter. I guess the question is just what are you waiting for to maybe get a little more aggressive with the balance sheet and maybe talk about the M&A pipeline in that context, too?\nPat Campbell: And you kind of raised one of them okay, one of them is we have started to I\u2019ll call it stimulate the M&A process. So, we will have a better read here as we go through the first half of the year as to what properties we are interested in, what\u2019s available. We did run a little bit stronger than we thought from a cash flow perspective. Realistically I think it\u2019s going to probably be more by mid-year or so before we feel comfortable trying to address a different solution.\nGeorge Buckley: There is a nice pipeline developing in the consumer and office basis. Nice pipeline developing in the safety and securities spaces with dominance in the way these things are coming up overseas where we have a lot of cash. So, I think it won't be too long before you see that sort of rolls back in the bloom so to speak.\nTerry Darling of Goldman Sachs: Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nGeorge Buckley: Thanks, Terry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.\nSteve Winoker: I'm trying to just get a better sense. I know it's hard to do but look at core growth attributable to new product sales versus the footprint, the geographic footprint in the end market overall. So, just product vitality index in terms of where that's running now and in any sense for this?\nGeorge Buckley: It's running Steve, it's just a teeny weenie bit under 29% for last year, and moving at about for the company as a whole moving about two points a year. Now we also have the other thing we have been trying to do which is as we sort of managed the breadth of the pyramid a little bit better we are trying as best we can reduce some of the sort of leaky bucket (cannibalization). So, hopefully as a consequence of that we might get a little bit more lift in the growth as we try to plug the bucket as-well-as fill it with new products if you forgive my sort of analogy there. So, I think this by the way we said this in New York, this is a number that's dominated by the core of 3M. Whereas if you gone back to 2005 and a number in the low teens it's more than doubled since that time. So, we are very enthusiastic. You are in a company like 3M it's like some technological candy store. But let me tell you the candy store is going to a super store from what we can tell right now. And the ideas are coming out all over the place. Now, if we can just make sure that our colleagues in the R&D and the marketing areas get this stuff launched in a timely fashion, it's extremely encouraging what we see with the deliver of these R&D numbers. So, I just am becoming increasingly positive about the model we got and the way that the technology folks at 3M have just lifted their game and absolutely done everything that we asked of them. So, I'm really pleased and very optimistic for the future.\nSteve Winoker: Even if you look at just 2010 and you have been running at this two points per year, you actually see the slope of this steepening significantly the trajectory increasing?\nGeorge Buckley: Well, it's all about the definition of the word significantly. I don't want to get so it sound (inaudible) or anything like that. But it is going to move a little faster. And I think we made our targets clear. We want to be before 2014 we want to be at that 40% number. We know if we could drive it passed that's great. But given the kind of erosion (cannibalization) that you see in the company that 40% is really going to help us drive toward those higher growth numbers that we spoken about several times now. So it's so nice to see in the company many of these longer standing issues that we dealt with fixed supply chain running very nicely, the R&D start picking up. The pyramid management thing seems to be an absolute godsend in the way we handled it for this time. So, there is so much positive news and Pat and I are sort of keepers of the gate on capital. And it almost doesn't seem that as day goes by where people seem to be one getting a new order for this and a new big launch for that. We might be tight on capacity. So, it just feels a lot, lot better than heretofore, Steve.\nSteve Winoker: And since you mentioned capacity, I remember that I think the December 2008 guidance for CapEx was down something like 10% down. You ended up the year down closer to 40% and you're guiding to this year up mid-11% to 22% so that sort of billion dollar level. How should I think about that, what happened versus what was expected and as you look forward ramping up capacity?\nPat Campbell: Well, again Steve. We kind of executed what we said we would do for '09. We had invested in some capacity and so forth over the last couple of years so we consciously pull that back. We aren't going to let CapEx hamstring our growth here. Our guidance is a billion dollars here for 2010. We thank a billion to a billion two as it is kind of a good run rate for the company. I will tell you I would love to comeback to you mid-year and say that we have so many other good growth ideas that we want to take our CapEx number up even higher. But that's our current thinking as (inaudible) says just in the last probably couple of weeks, months there has been a number of good breakthroughs where some customers in spots that we have some capacity issues. George and I will be facing okay, what we thought we had is a little bit of a (kitty) for the year has been used up by the business people very rapidly for good growth program. So if that number creeps up a little bit, I guess I wouldn't be surprised these will be for absolutely the right reason.\nGeorge Buckley: Wouldn't be bad news.\nPat Campbell: But I think that\u2019s kind of order of magnitude for you, Steve.\nSteve Winoker: Okay and can you give us some idea from where some of those businesses are, where you are getting these nicer surprises?\nPat Campbell: I will tell you, it is literally almost all over the portfolio. I can think of someone in health care. I can see some industrial and see some in safety and security in the electronics group okay. So is it literally across the board.\nGeorge Buckley: And I really do think, Steve, it's a response to the commitment that we had to reinvent the technological core of the company. I really do think that's happening and the customers are seeing it. The customers love it. The scientists are just totally committed to it. So, it just feels so much better now. And hopefully that 2010 unfolds we will see more of this accelerating and then you guys will be able to accuse Pat and myself of being overly conservative as you usually do. But let\u2019s hope that's the case.\nPat Campbell: Steve, I think there is another element of this. And as we just said, as we just got back from the trip to China and in India and few other spots. I think the other thing that's happening is our local lab capability gets better and better we are getting more and more local pride development done and they are also realizing that they need more and more local manufacturing as well. So, I think that's also going to as our new product development for local markets continues to accelerate we are going to have to deal with some of the local manufacturing issues as well.\nGeorge Buckley: I mentioned it briefly earlier Steve that abrasives thing that I showed you in New York, I mean, it looks like it's an absolute game changer. Changes the basis of competition dramatically and I can point to many others like that. I'm so enthusiastic by what's happening. And so let's hope that this year tends to be kind of the start of something big. Sounds like a cue for a song.\nSteve Winoker: And just as a last follow-up. It sounds like when you talk about this growth, a lot of your decision about where to guide to and operating margins of that 21% to 22% was a decision about how much to quote reinvest in the new business ventures and some of the other items you mentioned about $100 million increase. Is that decision to invest more, is it really 100 million incremental? Or is there more there that I'm not seeing?\nPat Campbell: Well, Steve, it's at least a 100 okay. And it's going to appear in a number of cases. As there are some cases its R&D investment. Other cases it's that had much investment okay, in some international markets and the life source. Its going to be a kind of as a broad base kind of category relative to investments. And by the way, there is a number of people that are still in the queue that would like to invest and we have to make a judgment. One where the organizational capability to pull off and then two, how well is the business running. I think you are spot on when you kind of look at the way I think of running the business in this margin range is what I want to do is make sure that we were investing in all of the great growth opportunities we have. So, as we do that obviously, you'll have the tendency to may be trend towards the lower end of that margin range. And I like nothing better than to actually have the business be running stronger here on a top line basis and our ability to reinvest back in additional growth ideas.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks, Jason (inaudible) sitting in for David this morning. For a moment I thought Pat said you had a new line of pocket protectors? I guess sort of excited.\nPat Campbell: I probably did. You want me to send you a new pocket protector.\nUnidentified Analyst: Please do. But I will pay full price. The commodity inflations mentioned, Pat, are there any segments in particular you to highlight where you are raising prices to offset raw materials at this point?\nPat Campbell: Not specifically. We take very close look at that on a business by business. The business people have to lead that forward, not as close to that. But it is spotty okay, those that are kind of impacted by I will call it oil derived commodity increases and it is a little more spotty on a business by business basis. They know what they have to do from managing that. And in some cases they have raised prices. But I say its going to be on a much more select basis as we go into 2000, 2010. It\u2019s the way I would see it right now.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a double back on the respirators. George, you mentioned this sort of handoff of H1N1 were to slow and new products pick up, on balance for the year, do you guys at this point anticipate any sort of head wind from respirator sales?\nGeorge Buckley: Not materially. You know, you obviously don't know exactly when the H1N1 demand is going to fall off. Certainly its going to be some tied to the seasonality of all around the world for that matter. So demand at the moment still seems to be robust. I think you have to be realistic about it that it will come to an end eventually. But I kind of mentioned the connected point that we have been working on obviously on approved N95 respirators that can reach down into parts of the market that we could never touch previously. And obviously that\u2019s going to demand some capacity, those things are very close to being released. We are not going to make as much money, its kind of the speaking on those products as we would have done on some of the others. So, we will probably see sales okay. So we see a little bit of margin compression depending on what kind of mix we get out of that. But all in all again it's another great business. And we prove ourselves to be I think the folks in that business masters of managing this kind of crisis and I think it's one of those business we remain positive about and I think with the products coming out all in all its going to be okay.\nUnidentified Analyst: Excellent. Thanks very much.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.\nGeorge Buckley: Well, Thanks for joining us today, everybody. We had a lot of material to cover. We did have some very good questions. I know we did have a couple we could not get to in the interest of time. So we will be back in touch this morning with you. Thanks for coming. Looking forward to talking to you next quarter and in between as well, thanks.\nPat Campbell: Thanks everyone."}, {"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 3, "year": 2009, "date": "2009-10-27 16:53:09", "content": "Executives: Joel Moskowitz - Chairman and CEO Jerry Pellizzon - CFO David Reed - President of North American Operations Marc King - President of Ceradyne Armor System  Michael Kraft - VP of Nuclear and Semiconductor Business Units\nAnalysts: Gary Liebowitz - Wells Fargo Securities Josephine Millward - Dougherty Avinash Kant - D.A.

Welcome to Ceradyne\u2019s Third Quarter 2009 Conference Call. This conference is being recorded today, October 27, 2009 at the request of Ceradyne. All participants are currently in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. We request that participants limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to allow others on the call an opportunity to participate. Hosting the call today is Joel Moskowitz, Ceradyne\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; with him are David Reed, President of North American Operations; Jerry Pellizzon, Chief Financial Officer; Marc King, President of Ceradyne Armor System and Michael Kraft, Vice President of Nuclear and Semiconductor Business Units.  Before I turn the call over to Mr. Moskowitz, the company has requested that I read the following statement. The matters discussed in this conference call may include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future performance of Ceradyne that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in the company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Moskowitz. Please go ahead sir.\nJoel Moskowitz:  Thank you, Rachael and good morning everyone and now we appreciate you dialing in for our third quarter Ceradyne earnings conference and there will be a bit different today I'm not at the office with the executives. I'm at home. I had some successful surgery on my left hip on last Tuesday. It was very similar to what I did in March on my right hip and I expect that I'll be back in the office sometime by late next week but I'm kind of walk my feet for a little while but things are going fine.  And I wanted to continue with our routine of these conference calls in an orderly manner since Jerry and his staff always works so hard to get the numbers together and file the 10-Q. Our shipments for the quarter or sales were a $108 million that compared to about a $168 million a year ago and the net income was $4.9 million or $0.19 per fully diluted share. And that compared to $1.8 million which it compared to $0.07 a year ago. And we announced that we're adjusting our guidance for the full year 2009 from $0.70 per fully diluted share to about $0.60 per fully diluted shares that's for 2009 from sales of $420 million that will now be $410 million to $415 million. And the forward-looking estimate that we are providing for fully diluted earnings per share does not include the impact of the total restructured and impairment pre-tax charges for all of 2009, which are estimated to be above $0.55 per fully diluted share.  We then describe the gross profit margin at 26.5% in the third quarter of \u201909 that compares to 39.7% in the same period in \u2019'08, and the provision for income taxes was 22.4% which compares to a provision for income taxes of 36.1% in the same period in \u201908. For the nine months, our shipments were $303 million that compared to $541.3 million last year with a loss for the nine months ending September 30, 2009 of $5.6 million or $0.22 per fully diluted share.  The loss included charges for restructuring and impairment that had a negative impact by reducing fully diluted earnings per share, by approximately $0.51, for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. The charges for restructuring and impairment totaled $17.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2009, which included a pre-tax $11.9 million restructuring charge, due to the closure of our plant in France and other severance expenses, a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $3.8 million to write down the value of goodwill, of our Ceradyne Canada reporting structure, and to reflect the current industry and economic environment as well as accelerated depreciation of $1.6 million resulting from a revision of the estimated useful wise of certain assets. The gross profit margin for the nine months was 24.8% of net sales that compared to 39.5% last year. The provision for income taxes was 9.7% in the nine months and that compared to 36.2% in \u2019''08. New orders for the three months ended September 30th, \u201809 were $100.5 million that compared to $119.4 million for the same period last year. For the nine months ending September 30th new orders were $330.6 million that compared to $476.6 million for the comparable period last year.  Our backlog, as of September 30th, \u201909, was $156.3 million compared to a totaled backlog in \u201808 at September 30th of $174.9 million. Now, that describes the third quarter and the nine months. I went on to explain that the company continues to move in a direction that we\u2019ve discussed multiple times, that is, a balanced company right now.  We have about 52% of our sales both in the quarter and for the year-to-date on a non-defense, I mean in defense areas, that\u2019s down from well over 85% in prior periods, prior years. And that we see significant opportunities in this non-defense sectors for growth, particularly in solar energy, aluminum smelting, oil & gas drilling and certain naval entirely new applications of our materials used in the manufacturing of glass and automotive related components.  Having said that, the lightweight ceramic armor business which declined as a share we believe next year we will be approaching a sustainable rate in the various areas that we are involved in for our body armor and other armor products and that we see additional opportunities particularly in body armor for a newer design for our new shipments to our allies which have been almost non-existent until what we anticipate will be 2010 activity for vehicle armor components and potentially a new business for our recently acquired helmet operation.  We also most recently have had major discussions in China relating primarily to aluminum smelting and the Chinese market which is extremely active in this area perhaps one of the most active.  Specifically, I went on to point out that our Ceradyne bearing technologies group had just finished our first fully successful drilling through a difficult Texas formation and what that meant was that we put the bid end our customer bid and it went for a 160 hours without ever removing it until it reached its final projected depth of penetration.  And we believe that this is extremely successful and unusual based on input from our customer and it will be the beginning of a series of proprietary bearing products for oil and gas drilling.  I had mentioned before, our work on a new type of a filter or separator in the North Sea and that\u2019s being performed by our German operation ESK Ceramics. That\u2019s going along very well we\u2019ve received our first orders and we expect to have [parts] in the water in the North Sea, probably early in 2010. While we haven\u2019t talked too much about and we won\u2019t go into details, is that we have some new opportunities for new compositions of theoretically done [softer] ceramics in the order of real industry not for parts regards, but for machines and make parts regards. And you\u2019ll hear more about that as we get further along in our development.  The aluminum smelting which we\u2019ve been talking about for years now is showing a little bit signs of life, not only in the opportunities for future business which is in China and other places, but also with our work in Canada, where we\u2019ve only recently received a multi-million dollar release on some material for the [sales]. As far as the large order that some of you are knowledgeable about that we bid on the enhanced combat helmet, the ECH with Diaphorm. The Marines have asked for additional work to be done on that and which we will do and we\u2019re still quite optimistic on our product line. However where I think last time we saw it, an order might be placed really right now, it appears that it will be sometime early in 2010.  Now, we have a wide range of guidance. We often report by the end of the prior year like right now on what we see for the following year and we have an extensive process by which our people produce their projections by customer and product and timeline. And there\u2019s a wide range and so we are projecting that range for next year of $380 million to $430 million in sales, and with earnings resulting from that of $0.60 to $1.05 per fully diluted shares assuming we have about $25.8 million shares outstanding in an annual tax rate of 31%. Now that concluded the tax part of the press release which was issued a few hours before we open this morning and as we\u2019ve done in the past, I\u2019m going to ask Jerry Pellizzon to review the tables of the balance sheet and income statement. Jerry?\nJerry Pellizzon: Thank you Joel. Good morning everybody. There\u2019s a note we filed our Form-10Q with the SEC earlier this morning, good history this quarter that we saw [11.5] of our business at obviously lower levels when compared to 2008, yet the order rates on a demand levels have stabilized. So basically, if you look at the difference between the two periods of the quarter of \u201809 versus the third quarter of \u201808, we had a reduction in sales of $60 million and it was really centralized in armor components being body armor and vehicle armor are been [off] by $50 million and then ESK been $10 million representing a $60 million roughly, the rest of the business is relatively flat. So we've seen that the order book has stabilized and we are making recovery at ESK in terms of turning that operation around. In terms of some additional color free cash flow which we define as net income plus depreciation and amortization less capital expenditures and including the impact of changes in working capital for the three months ended September 30, or the third quarter was $23 million versus $34 million in the comparable period last year. For the nine months, our free cash flow was $35 million versus $91 million in the comparable period last year. EBITDA was $17 million in the third quarter compared to $43 million in the same period last year and for the nine months we have an EBITDA of $17 million versus a $156 million in a comparable period last year. CapEx year-to-date has amounted to $13.6 million compared $36 million last year and our depreciation was running at about $9.4 million compared to $12.1 million during the third quarter of last year. Some additional color on the guidance, we had a wide range there and it's basically in three areas. We have a range of about $30 million in our body armor business, are for programs that on a conservative basis we didn\u2019t get a high end into the low end or to be conservatively the low end is down by $30 million. On vehicle armor, we're anticipating about $27 million on the high end and $20 million on the low end, so a $7 million difference there. And then on the helmet business, we are anticipated on the high end of about $23 million, $24 million and on the low end $12 million. So that is primarily the difference between the high end of the revenue and the low end of the revenue and that then of course falls into our earnings per share guidance to adjusted down to that level of $0.60 to $1.5.  We are encouraged about \u201910; we continue to have available cash flow to acquire additional bonds that we own bonds that are outstanding our convert. And from time to time we still have about $50 million and authorization of purchase stock.  During the quarter we purchased about $3.4 million of our converts or about $2.8 million unfortunately the convert has gone up and valued to about $0.93, $0.94 on a dollar we were buying it in the low 80s in the second and the third quarter.  Okay, back to you Joel.\nJoel Moskowitz: Okay. I think that because we are all spread out best thing would be to go right into the questions and answers. So Rachel if you could put us into Q&A mode.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Gary Liebowitz, with Wells Fargo Securities. \nGary Liebowitz - Wells Fargo Securities: Good morning Jerry. Joel, I think I missed it on the first call I think you said there\u2019s a $30 million range for embedded in the body armor expectations for next year. Could you give the actual numbers?\nJoel Moskowitz: David, David why don\u2019t you talk about the armor?\nDavid Reed: Well, the range is $90 million to roughly $120 million in sales for the body armor business.\nGary Liebowitz - Wells Fargo Securities: And Thomas, how much XSAPI (inaudible) is included in that and maybe you can just breakout the larger components of that $90 million to $120 million for us?\nDavid Reed: That ranges has spread out over all of the services. The XSAPI number I think is somewhere what is that Jerry, about $15 million?\nJerry Pellizzon: Yeah. $15 million\nDavid Reed: Around $15 million, that\u2019s the continuation of our existing order. We will complete that order in by the end of February now and then we do not anticipate any further XSAPI pass to that point. The rest of these orders and is composed of some anticipated spare orders through [DSPT] for ESAPI anticipated orders for lighter-weight inserts that we believe will be coming out of the army and possibly the marines for the Afghan [theatre] and the campaign there. We\u2019ll also be composed of continuing orders from our SOCOM on our multi-year contract where the family of scalable body armor that we supplied to the Special Forces right now. So each of those is somewhere in the somewhere in the $12 million to $18 million range and we also have the opportunity to do continued FMS contracts on the existing contract that we won competitively last year. So, that\u2019s kind of how it breaks down.\nGary Liebowitz - Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. Thanks for the color. I just want to follow-up. You\u2019ve mentioned that you are looking to developing at present ESAPI which is 10% or 15% lighter. How would you evaluate the competitive landscape for a replacement the ESAPI?\nDavid Reed: Well I think, Ceradyne is positioned as well as anybody to provide those lightweight products or whether or not the army decides that they are going to go with a lightweight ESAPI or something lighter at a lesser protective level is uncertain at this point really. But certainly we have as much experience and more than anybody in the ESAPI regiment and I think we can supply a lighter weight ESAPI by at least 10%. So, that\u2019s kind of our goal and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be offering up for the army.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Josephine Millward with Dougherty.\nJosephine Millward - Dougherty: Can you give us an update on how much XSAPI you actually shifted during the quarter?\nJoel Moskowitz: Sure. Dave, you want to handle that?\nDavid Reed: Yeah, it\u2019s in the queue just give me, you can go on to the next question, I will try and get it out of the queue. We have it in the queue right? I don\u2019t remember at the top of my head the exact number, I will get it\u2026. \nJosephine Millward - Dougherty: Okay, maybe the other way. Do you feel like, let me rephrase the question. Do you feel I expected our $200 million for body armor for the year?\nDavid Reed: We\u2019re looking at about $180 million.\nJosephine Millward - Dougherty: $180 million, okay.\nDavid Reed: Right.\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Dougherty: So, maybe you can talk about the rest of your business. If your body armor is going from roughly $180 million down to $90 million to a $120 million, can you talk about what other areas you expect to drive growth next year?\nDavid Reed: Jerry, why don\u2019t you a kind of in rough terms review the projections that you sent me yesterday that come up with the sales numbers that we gave, where that comes from.\nJerry Pellizzon: Sure, we\u2019re going to where some of the line items are in terms of the upside we had armor and helmets up from about $3 million this year up to either between the range of $12 million and $24 million next year. And for vehicle armor we planned to do about $14 million this year, we\u2019ll do about anywhere from $20 million to $27 million next year. Additionally in the crucible business, this year we\u2019ll do about $34 million overall on both sides meaning Atlanta and Tianjin and we anticipate next year we\u2019ll do $49 million, so that we are seeing some good growth there. We see some growth bearing technology business. Basically we\u2019ve got bout, we\u2019ll do about a million this year. Josephine, we should come in around $7 million to $7.4 million next year, so, we are seeing some growth there. And additionally on our police helmet business, we\u2019ll do about $2.5 million this year. We\u2019ll do about $7 million next year. So, that\u2019s primarily the most of the deltas to the sales items.\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Dougherty: Okay. And then. \nJerry Pellizzon: Overall.\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Dougherty:  I\u2019m sorry, the bearing business. Does that fall under thermal materials, or it is\u2026?\nJerry Pellizzon: Bearing is under the ACL segment. \nJosephine Millward \u2013 Dougherty: Okay. Also same thing with police helmets then.\nJerry Pellizzon: Correct.\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Dougherty: Okay. What about your outlook for ESK next year? Can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing out of industrial customers.\nJerry Pellizzon: What we\u2019re seeing, a slight pick up overall our forecast next year is $92 million for ESK. We\u2019re using right now we\u2019re using an FX rate of $140 million on that so we\u2019re little shy on that, might be a little more growth because the FX rates are between the Euro and the Dollar, higher than that. This year we\u2019ll closing in at $85 million. Next year, we\u2019re looking at an EBIT for them of just about break-even and we\u2019re going to continue to work on that throughout the year but that\u2019s the big turnaround from this year of course.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Avinash Kant with D.A. Davidson.\nAvinash Kant - D.A. Davidson: Questions on the industrial side, of course you\u2019ve been trying to cut cost in Europe. Could you talk a little bit about what has taken longer than what you thought earlier and how would that go from here on?\nJerry Pellizzon: Well, I think that the European operation this year was dominated by the write offs that we had on the French operation. We were losing up to a 150,000 Euros a month earlier this year. So that\u2019s the biggest thing we did and it\u2019s not complete yet. It will be finished in a next few months and then what we plan to do is to move much of that operation to Germany and also we have plans now to incorporate at least a part of that in our new Tianjin, China operation. We\u2019re going to build whenever we give the actual go which probably won\u2019t be till early 2010. About a 200 to 250,000 square foot facility of which we\u2019re going to put industrial products related to ESK and to about 20% of that, so that will help us be more competitive in the competitive market. In the fluid handling department anecdotally these companies are not bouncing back but they are coming back and their inventories are down so far that we have seen at least a leveling of actually a few up ticks on our fluid handling products and we anticipate that there will be these new product lines anything from the ceramic filters for filtering the oil that I mentioned earlier to chemical reactors and heat exchangers. In addition we\u2019ve just cut a lot of costs. I mean there are a lot of people who aren\u2019t here right now to right size the company. So, I think that the drive that the last question that Josephine had asked, which was a good one. If you are looking at reducing your shipments by over $80 million yet the truth is that the sales are going to be ball parked the same in the earnings, they are going to be slightly greater, where is it coming from? And it\u2019s coming from the reduction in our costs and some new product lines that have higher margins inherently because they smack of being a proprietary product line.\nAvinash Kant - D.A. Davidson: Now also your assumptions at crucibles are going up from \u201909 to \u201910 roughly some $34 million to $49 million.\nJerry Pellizzon: Right.\nAvinash Kant - D.A. Davidson: What kind of ASP assumptions are in there?\nJerry Pellizzon: Well we are assuming that the current pricing structure which had come down by over 30% in China is going remain firm. We have recent information as the market place is beginning to identify that our product is a superior product. That won\u2019t be enough to get us more money but it will be enough to keep what we have and not subject us to continued price reduction. So, on both these two basic price structures for a jumbo and for the standard we expect them to remain where hey are now, which is not great news because they were much higher a year ago at this time.\nAvinash Kant - D.A. Davidson: All right, is the competitor is still cutting pricing?\nJerry Pellizzon: Not that we see right now. This real issues on quality, remember Avinash, if you have a part that doesn\u2019t work accusable, you can lose up to a thousand pounds of silicon and even at the reduced prices, that\u2019s unacceptable.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Quillin with Stephens Incorporate.\nTim Quillin - Stephens Incorporate: I just have three quick detailed questions, probably for Jerry. But one is, what tax rate do you expect in fourth quarter and then I think you have taken $0.51in charges to the first nine months, I guess the guidance presumes that you take another $0.04 charge in 4Q, I\u2019m wondering, what is that for? And then just lastly what were your revised CapEx plans for this year and next? Thanks.\nJoel Moskowitz: Jerry, why don\u2019t you handle all that question?\nJerry Pellizzon: Sure. On the tax rate for the fourth quarter, we have a little bit of an anomaly, in that we have a release from, according to the provisions the FIN 48 for a tax reserve that we\u2019ve had, it\u2019s a recurring situation every year that\u2019s going to come in with $3 million credit, and now I think overall we are looking at about if you factor that out, you\u2019re looking at about an 18% rate before the $3 million credit. So, that\u2019s the situation with that number in terms of the depreciation and amortization, Tim, next year we\u2019re looking at depreciation and amortization of about $46 million of which $10 million of that is allocated to ACO, $13 million to ESK, $12 million to Thermo and the balance to our Boron segment. Additionally, the CapEx next year is $48 million and the big pieces of that really is China, where we are going to spend a budget amount of $25.7 million. We\u2019ll close the year out with about $16 million to $17 million to CapEx in 2009 and I think you asked to one other question? \nTim Quillin - Stephens Incorporate: Regarding the 4Q, plan 4Q charge and what that relates to?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Oh, sure. The plan Q4 plan charge is the leftover budget amounts from the closure of (inaudible). So, we got about budget amount leftover of about $0.04 per share to round that as a total of $0.55 for the year from the $0.51 we spent so far through the nine months that is September 30th.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Lewitt, ThinkEquity.\nMichael Lewitt : If you could talk about any progress being made like aluminum smelting or drilling in like other cosmetic business?\n ThinkEquity: If you could talk about any progress being made like aluminum smelting or drilling in like other cosmetic business?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Well. I\u2019ll handle that. On the aluminum smelting, this a program Ceradyne has been working on for quite a long time. Primarily, through it\u2019s ESK operation and the whole essence is to effectively revolutionize the way that you convert bauxite the aluminum oxide portion thereof into aluminum metal which is really a very, very mature process that been done the same way probably about a 100 years and use carbon electrodes and the one on the bottom is called the cathode and our idea is to convert that from carbon to our electrically conductive ceramic called Titanium Diboride and now that would save electricity.  It would probably enhance the life of the cell by years and it may also increase productivity. So, we have been working on that I referred earlier too an order that we recently had multi-million dollar order which was for additional low level production of a customer for that product and I continue to feel particularly now in China as to our staff is that the opportunities in China are quite significant because they are so concerned about electricity not only because it causes pollution but because they don\u2019t have very much. Even though they are putting on a new coal-fired plant a week and then a new oil-fired plant almost as readily and nuclear power plants but they take a long time up to 10 years. So, if you can save electricity and our cathode for sure saves electricity and has to be looked on very favorably. If that works out to put it in dollars and cents it could mean 100s of millions or $1 billion to Ceradyne because of the need for this particularly ceramic. So, although it\u2019s taking an extremely long time and our patients (inaudible). I also think is the rationale for going forward is stronger not weaker as time goes on because of the need to reduce electricity reduce cost. The terrific increase in demand for aluminum metal, as well as reducing the cost of electricity which is the major cost by the way in making aluminum.  So that looks very good and on the other areas that you mentioned the cosmetics that\u2019s a very small part of Ceradyne, and the answer is I really don\u2019t know the exact sales numbers. But it\u2019s a very small part of the company it\u2019s less than the percent or so. And we anticipate, it\u2019s kind of a 60% because we\u2019re one of the very few companies who make the material which is called boron nitride. Which is has the same feeling as talc. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael French with Morgan Joseph.\nMichael French : First question on the helmet side the redesign work here. Does this effect the competitive situation at all, you referred anecdotally as everybody has had some issue is that accurate or.\n Morgan Joseph: First question on the helmet side the redesign work here. Does this effect the competitive situation at all, you referred anecdotally as everybody has had some issue is that accurate or.\nJoel Moskowitz: Why don\u2019t I let Dave, or Mark handle that. Dave why don\u2019t you take it. \nDave Reed: Yeah. I\u2019d be glad, yeah Michael I think you are correct in your assessment, everybody has had some issues that Marines and the Army feel that they should address so we\u2019re actually meeting with them today, to get our final reading on what they would like to see a little different from the first testing of the initial helmets we sent in. And then we anticipate getting them new helmets within the next 45 days or so. And we feel that what we\u2019ve been told and what we\u2019ve seen in the day is not so difficult to correct so we think we\u2019ll be in a very position to give them exactly what they are looking for.\nMichael French : Okay, good, and the follow up is on utilization rates that are based on the assumption here your press release mentions body armor had a sustainable level. Just wondering what the rate should be at Costa Mesa and Lexington?\n Morgan Joseph: Okay, good, and the follow up is on utilization rates that are based on the assumption here your press release mentions body armor had a sustainable level. Just wondering what the rate should be at Costa Mesa and Lexington?\nJoel Moskovitz: Dave?\nDavid Reed: Michael, are you referring to the rates of half pricing or just the total?\nMichael French : Yes, in half prices. \n Morgan Joseph: Yes, in half prices. \nDavid Reed: We will probably be doing the majority of our half pricing at Lexington going forward is only minimal support out of the Costa Mesa facility. We continue to make semiconductor materials and (inaudible) materials here and a lot of R&D perk but obviously, going down to a $100 million to $120 million roughly compared to 500. We have five lines so we don\u2019t have to utilize all of those lines to get there. It gives us great surge capability but that\u2019s kind of our plan going forward is to concentrate our efforts out of the Lexington facility and minimize them here to help save some money. \nMichael French : All right. Can you give us a ballpark on how much that would save you?\n Morgan Joseph: All right. Can you give us a ballpark on how much that would save you?\nDavid Reed: I don\u2019t think we rolled that total number but it\u2019s probably several million dollars in total savings when you look at the decreased cost of the inventory that you have to carry and the management team that\u2019s duplicated out here.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. \nJim Ricchiuti : Good to hear you Joel. Question regarding new products in 2010, if you put aside ECH for a minute and just is there a way to aggregate some of the new products for instance in the oil and gas market and just give us an idea what that might represent in revenue next year?\n Needham & Company: Good to hear you Joel. Question regarding new products in 2010, if you put aside ECH for a minute and just is there a way to aggregate some of the new products for instance in the oil and gas market and just give us an idea what that might represent in revenue next year?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Well we can do it in a real time basis eliminating what you said the ECH, if we look at the bearings remember Dave told you we did or Jerry did. About it we will do $1 million in change this year and we are looking at $7 million in 2010. Now that market can be a much larger than that, the market for bearing is much larger and it\u2019s somewhere between a $30 million and a $100 million. So that\u2019s not insignificant, the $1 million certainly was and the $7 million is good and not such a good year but when you get to $30 million or more that becomes a material to Ceradyne Inc. because we should make pretty good margins on that and it uses our proprietary. Remember this is a patented product that uses our silicon carbide, a completely different way of going down haul particularly for slant drilling because when you make the turn not to get too technical you can use a shorter bearing stack and that allows you to make a tighter turn and a lot of good things happen when you do that. So we are working on that, on the filter that I mentioned earlier those are fairly expensive products 100s of 1000s dollars per each line. There are 100s of lines already installed and they will coming on stream. It\u2019s too early to predict a high number for that because we are not going into the water until probably January but that also would be a very significant opportunity for Ceradyne A very significant opportunity for Ceradyne. The single largest of course break out will be solar. Solar generally which we\u2019ve done very well in and our plant in China probably has some of the best margins in the company. And it was doing terrific and this year even in not a good year it grew but the margins were down because of reduction in pricing. I mean that could easily increase if you go by the projections on the requirements in megawatts. Over the next four years that could increase five fold and more.  So instead of a $40 million in change we could be looking at during several hundreds of millions. So it\u2019s all the new product lines and of course the out wire is the aluminum smelting. We\u2019ll view in the low millions of dollars this year again in prototypes it will be probably higher than \u201909 \u201910 because they just need some more prototypes. But this 37,000 all sales in the world and the average replace them every five years and that doesn\u2019t include any growth and there is growth particularly in China. So that just stands by itself that becomes the company if that were successful.\nJim Ricchiuti : Okay that\u2019s helpful, Joel. And Jerry if I may just question for you as we think about a couple of the expense items going forward, G&A expense and R&D should we assume these kind of levels over the next couple of quarters. Do you anticipate much of a change there?\n Needham & Company: Okay that\u2019s helpful, Joel. And Jerry if I may just question for you as we think about a couple of the expense items going forward, G&A expense and R&D should we assume these kind of levels over the next couple of quarters. Do you anticipate much of a change there?\nJerry Pellizzon: No we don\u2019t anticipate much of a change at all. There maybe some additional follow through dollars on the closure of that, but those are special one time charges of restructuring. But the G&A and R&D should be fairly consistent.\nOperator: And your final question comes from Gary Liebowitz with Wells Fargo Security.\nGary Liebowitz - Wells Fargo Security:  Jerry, just for next year\u2019s cash flow a follow-up, working capital do you expect that to be a source or a use of cash?\nJerry Pellizzon: Actually, we expect it to be a source but minimally speaking we still have to do some investing in terms of inventory levels at different locations, so we see a slight source only of about $5 million, Gary.\nGary Liebowitz - Wells Fargo Security: And just to be clear even with the lower expectations for body armor sales next year, you\u2019ve essentially completed your restructuring activities, going into the 23?\nJerry Pellizzon: No. We\u2019re still working on them. We\u2019re still working through restructuring activities for \u201810 relative to body armor. We haven\u2019t made any definite conclusions, we got some ideas but we\u2019ll be working through some things later on this quarter and next quarter. And then formulating plans this quarter and implementing them next year.\nGary Liebowitz - Wells Fargo Security: And plus those costs are not included in the outlook because of EPS guys?\nJerry Pellizzon: Well, I think it\u2019s a few things you are talking about. I mean if you\u2019re talking about the cost reduction, they are. If you are talking about anything else with regard to impairment, they\u2019re not. We haven\u2019t decided what to do with certain lines so we haven\u2019t established any impairment yet, and we haven\u2019t determined that, that\u2019s necessary at this point, because we don\u2019t have a definite plan going forward.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Josephine Millward with Dougherty.\nJosephine Millward - Dougherty: On your last earnings call you talked about maybe roughly $40 million to $45 million for solar crucible in \u201909 and I think Jerry just gave us $34 million for the year. Can you talk about what\u2019s changed in your outlook?\nJoel Moskowitz: For the year Jerry you said we are going to ship 39 \u201909?\nJerry Pellizzon:  Yeah. Approximate.\nJoel Moskowitz: And what do you have for in \u201910 its what 49?\nJerry Pellizzon: Yeah 49.\nJosephine Millward - Dougherty: Also Joel you said 39 for some reason I wrote doubt 34. Okay so that\u2019s pretty close enough.\nJerry Pellizzon: Yeah it\u2019s close enough to this discussion.\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Dougherty: What about this expansion in China. I think the last time we spoke you said you haven\u2019t decided whether to move forward with this expansion yet.\nJoel Moskowitz: Right. China is really an interesting situation. The answer to your question is we own the 13.7 acres and we had the plans as recently as last week we had a meeting an international meeting and we approved the plans which now includes like I said earlier about 40 to 50,000 square feet for ESK ceramics and a beautiful entry way so that their customers will feel they are going into a prime European high tech company as well as the solar people who already I believe have that imagine which is the correct image. So the question is when do we go forward? Right now we are planning to break around in January. So, that can change, the industry has been \u2013 it\u2019s got a lot of good words for 2010 and years and the real world is right now. People are worried about 2009, 2009 our customers are, because of the drop up in silicon all a lot of that helps us actually. So I would say right now we going to a break ground early next year, that\u2019s our plan that will only be changed if we see a turn down.\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Dougherty:\nLDK:\nJoel Moskowitz : Well, in China LDK is by far the largest but we have we are dealing with all of them now including (Inaudible) and the other Chinese companies as well as almost every one in the West. Our competitors receive (Inaudible) who actually have more of the business than we do but a lot of that has been in the West. So we are gaining market share in China now, and our customers in general aren\u2019t doing so well because of the drop in pricing and other issues yet. They are expanding very rapidly and the market has been kind to them in my opinion and will continue to be kind meaning they can go to the equity markets. They are expanding there facilities. The government of China is clearly connected to solar energy particularly internally and that\u2019s a lot of Chinese houses that could use solar on their roof and hopefully we would be the ones that will go use the ceramic to melt the silicon\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Dougherty: Joel I am sure aware LDK has ownership in a Chinese silver crucible company \u2013 I mean how does that play into your relationship without LDK and are you concerned about additional pricing competition?\nJoel Moskowitz : I am not so concerned about pricing but I am always concerned when our customer has a piece of the action of the competitor which they do. This has been the case by the way for probably two and half years and without mentioning names I stated earlier that quality is very, very important on these products. You just cannot have a failure and we don\u2019t have failures. There is two ways you have failures. One is a leaker where you have a molten silicon just leaks out of the microcrack and molten silicon has the viscosity of water so its catastrophic when that happens and the other is you don\u2019t have the purity and remember we are a vertically integrated company, not only in armor but in the solar. We bought Minco a few years ago in Tennessee and we started with glass quality sand, SiO2 and we make this very, very high purity material that we ship to China because of our quality and reputation on purity. So of course it\u2019s an issue but that\u2019s what this is, an issue. It\u2019s not so easy to make these parts. They are very big. They have very high purity and we\u2019re very good at it. I was more concerned if you would ask that question a year a half ago than I am today.\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Dougherty: One final question, Joel. When do you plan on going back to the office?\nJoel Moskowitz: Wednesday.\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Dougherty: Well, I hope you get better soon and\u2026\nJoel Moskowitz: Actually I feel pretty good. I told Dave that I better not take one of these pain pills. So I\u2019ll be too high on the phone call.\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Dougherty: Well, you sound great.\nJoel Moskowitz: Yeah, I\u2019m feeling really fine now and it\u2019s a very mechanical thing. It was 16 years ago that I had the hip put in and they don\u2019t touch the major structure. They just put on a ceramic pole by the way so I\u2019m really the ceramic man now.\nJosephine Millward \u2013 Dougherty: I know it\u2019s made by Ceradyne.\nJoel Moskowitz: It\u2019s not. I asked Reed to make it but he said I had to sign some kind of a release. That was more owner risk and all this stuff you sign when you go into the hospital but it\u2019s not made by Ceradyne but it\u2019s a very good one.\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes our Q&A session. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 2, "year": 2009, "date": "2009-07-23 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the 3M second quarter 2009 earnings conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, July 23, 2009. We would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations for 3M.\nMatt Ginter: Thank you, and good morning everyone. Joining me on today\u2019s call is George Buckley, 3M Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Pat Campbell, 3M Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call will summarize our financial results for the second quarter. A power point presentation accompanies today\u2019s conference call, which you can access on 3M\u2019s Investor Relations website at 3M.com. All elements of today\u2019s call, the slide presentation and the audio replay will be archived on our website for an extended period of time. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide two. During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risk and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Lastly, please mark your calendars for our next investor meeting, which is scheduled for December 8. We are tentatively planning to have the meeting in New York City. I will let you know when the complete details are available. So, let\u2019s begin today\u2019s review. Please turn to slide number three. And I will turn things over to George.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Thank you very much, Matt. Good morning everybody, and thank you very much for listening to our second quarter call. For 3M, the second quarter was a very interesting one. It marked a course of continued execution of our plan, tight control of our spending, effective management of our restructuring efforts and sharp focus on cash generation as we simultaneously worked hard to drive sales and market share everywhere that we could. A few positive sales surprises also got put into the mix. While we significantly overachieved relative to external expectations with organic volumes still down about 13% year-over-year. There is no question, but it was another very challenging quarter and particularly so early on. But compared to shrinkage of 19.5% in the first quarter, the second quarter was an impressive improvement, and there is no doubt that the second derivative of sales with respect to time certainly appears to be improving. But as tough as the economy remains, we are again encouraged by our ability to operate well in these times and maintain good margins and to generate huge amounts of cash. We achieved a free cash flow conversion of 160% this quarter, which is now 131% year-to-date. Overall business conditions in our end markets this quarter were pretty much in line with what we anticipated. The sales were a little bit stronger than we had expected here and there. In fact, we achieved sequential sales and profit improvements in all businesses and all regions. The sequential quarterly sales improvement was 12.4%. In addition, Health Care and Consumer and Office each drew double-digit year-on-year profit improvements. Pat will detail the quarter for you in a moment including several factors, which helped us this quarter. For example increased demand for optical films, as consumer electronics experienced an uptick especially LCD TVs, but only LCD TVs and the respiratory products used to help prevent the spread of the H1N1 virus. I must emphasize though that our excellent performance was mainly due to the 3M team acting early and vigorously to control those things, which were within our power to control. Our gross margin and inventory improvements show the control of our factories by our teams there was superb. And I would like to acknowledge publicly those people at 3M who led and participated in this fine effort. We outlined last quarter, the many corrective and control actions that we\u2019ve taken on costs and cash starting back in the spring of last year. And we\u2019ve continued resolutely on that costs. For example in the quarter, we reduced staffing levels across the world by another 1600 people, about 900 of whom came through restructuring almost all in Europe and Asia and another 700 via an early retirement program in the U.S. We absolutely do not take any pleasure in such things, but they are a sad feature of our life in these tough times. We also continued to streamline our factory operations to suit what we think will be the manufacturing footprint, excuse me, we need long-term. Some of what we see in the shrinking economy is probably not temporary. We think there are a few end markets that may have been fundamentally reset downwards, and perhaps so for many years. Housing is the best example of this reset, and automotive will likely see a bite come out of its long-term volume too, though percentage wise less than housing. We therefore remain committed to our operating and financial plan, which helps us greatly in the second quarter. And as we expected, the cost reductions from recent restructuring and other actions gained traction in the quarter. And we anticipate those benefits continuing throughout the rest of the year. Naturally, our strong performance this quarter raises the question about, where we are in relation to any economic recovery. I think in general terms; our business forecasts have so far been reasonably accurate. We explained on our first quarter call that our modeling suggested the U.S. economy will bottom somewhere between the end of the second and the end of the third quarter. And so far, all the evidence that we see continues to support that view. We are also forecasting that Q1 would be the darkest period of the recession for us, and so it was. We also expected that depending on the type of end markets, some channel restocking would begin to take place late in the second quarter, which it did. We forecast the earliest recovery would come in faster in short development cycle businesses such as electronics, which has also begun to happen. We said that we expected Asia would lead us out of recession, and that Europe as a whole would make the economic term later than the U.S. This is also happening and we see Europe still slowing as a whole, but with pockets of slight improvement here and there. The improvements in the quarter performance can be attributed to several different factors, which are one, slight improvements in end market demand, particularly in consumer electronics. This is happening more broader than just LCD TVs though, LCD monitors and some other segments of electronics too. I would only say that we have to be careful to interrupt this correctly and not to see what might turn out to be a false dawn. Second, there was a little inventory restocking by some distributors in anticipation of an economic recovery or perhaps to rectify low service levels after cutting inventory too deep. You will recall, we said we expected the market dynamics to be the same on the way up as they were on the way down. That\u2019s what we are seeing in these segments. Thirdly, share gains as customers have switched to us as a more reliable supplier than their former partners. The trick here, when the recovery really gets going is to keep it. Fourth, demand created by X factors such as H1N1 virus. These will always happen in a random and unforecastable way. The challenge here is having capacity flexible enough to ramp up fast, but not so large that it burdens the business during the lulls in demand. Fifth and perhaps most importantly, efficiency and productivity improvements produced by tight cost control and restructuring. You will see this reflected in our gross margin line, which is frankly spectacular to such huge falls in volume and testament to how well we are operating our plans in this environment. Regardless of whether this quarter is truly, the first ray of sunrise or whether it is actually a false dawn. Because of our early actions and continued discipline, we are well positioned to maintain 3M on this positive trajectory. I\u2019ll expand on our outlook after Pat\u2019s comments. And I will now turn the call over to Pat.\nPatrick D. Campbell: Thanks, George and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide number four. On a GAAP reported basis, earnings were $1.12 per share versus last year\u2019s $1.33. Excluding special items, this quarter\u2019s earnings were $1.20 per share, which was a few cents above our internal plans. We announced a number of restructuring actions across various businesses and geographies again in the second quarter. Related pre-tax restructuring charges totaled $116 million in the quarter or about $0.09 per share. The majority of those costs relates to the permanent reduction of approximately 900 positions spanning many businesses and geographies, although the majority of the reductions were concentrated in the U.S., Western Europe and Japan. In the U.S. another 700 people accepted the voluntary early retirement option. We expect a small portion of those employees that accepted the voluntary separation will be replaced in some form. So on a net-net basis, we estimate that total employment levels will drop by approximately 1,400 to 1,500 due to restructuring actions taken during the second quarter. Partially offsetting this charge was a pre-tax gain of $15 million, or $0.01 per share related to the sale of a New Jersey roofing granule facility. This gain was recorded in cost of sales within the Safety, Security and Protection Services Business. You will likely see some additional restructuring actions in the third quarter, but I would anticipate something smaller than those in Q1 or Q2. Please turn to slide number five for a recap of second quarter sales. While many end markets remain challenging in the second quarter, we did see a few emerging bright spots, such as consumer electronics and respiratory protection as George mentioned earlier. On a worldwide basis, sales declined about 15%. Organic sales volumes declined 13.5% year-on-year, stronger than our previous expectation of a negative 15% to a negative 20%, and a sizable improvement versus the 19.5% decline in Q1. Second quarter volumes were right in line with recent estimates of worldwide industrial production of a negative 12% to a negative 13%. It is our belief that many industries are either at or near bottom that inventory reductions in many end markets should continue to wane in the second half of the year, and that our growth should be equal to or better than industrial production. Global selling prices rose nearly 2% in the second quarter, and acquisitions added an additional 2.2 percentage points to growth. And finally currency impacts reduced second quarter sales by 5.5%. On a worldwide basis, sales on local currencies declined 9.4% year-on-year, including the 2.2% benefit from acquisitions. Our strongest performers were Health Care at a positive 2.2%, Display and Graphics at a negative 1.4% and Consumer and Office, which was down 2.9%. Local currency sales declined 10.6% in Safety, Security and Protection Services, 15.3% in Industrial and Transportation and 23.8% in the Electro and Communications. Turning to the regions, organic volumes declined 5.8% in Asia Pacific, which was much improved from the Q1 year-on-year volume decline of over 24%. Volumes were positive in Health Care, where the underlying market dynamics are obviously more favorable and Display and Graphics driven heavily by consumer electronics and more specifically optical films. European organic volumes declined 18.1% and the U.S. was down 14.8%. Health Care was the strongest performer in both regions with organic volumes down in the low single-digit range. Similar to last quarter, volume declines were most severe in Industrial and Transportation and Electro and Communications, impacted by superior double-digit declines in big markets like automotive, telecom, appliances, construction among others. Similar to the first quarter, organic volumes in the combined Latin America, Canada region declined 14%. Prices rose 2.7% in the U.S. 1.9% in Europe and 9.4% in the combined Latin America and Canada region. Of course, much of the increase in Latin America was due to currency, as we routinely raised prices there in order to offset the impact of weaker local currencies. Prices declined by 2.5% in Asia Pacific, which was all electronics related, so no surprise here. Now let\u2019s review the income statement. So please turn to slide number six. Operational excellence remains top of mind across the company, as evidenced by our 22.6% operating margin in the quarter. The fact that sales fall 15.1%, while operating profits declined only 13.4% should give you an idea about how aggressively we are managing our cost structure during this unprecedented period. Gross margins were 48.9%, up 70 basis points versus the same period last year. The decline in organic volumes obviously hurt our results here. But this was more other offset by aggressive reductions in our manufacturing cost structure. In addition, selling prices rose almost 2%, which added over 4 point to our gross margin year-on-year. Finally, raw materials turned nicely positive declining about 2% to 3%. This was the first year-on-year decline in our raw material index in many quarters. Second quarter SG&A and R&D spending declined 14% and 16% respectively about in line with sales. We began restructuring the company over one year-ago and the benefits of these actions are really starting to impact our results. In R&D, we continue to support our key larger programs, but overall spending will be impacted by our company wide cost initiatives such as in-direct spending reductions and the vacation policy change. In the sales and marketing area, advertising and merchandising costs were down year-on-year, but we expect them to rise in the second half of the year in support of our customer programs including back-to-school and the holiday season. Operating income was $1.3 billion, down 13.4% versus last year with again an outstanding operating income margin of 22.6%. Net interest expense increased $15 million, primarily driven by lower yields on cash deposits. On taxes, things were fairly steady. Second quarter\u2019s rate was 31.2% up 40 basis points year-on-year. On a year-to-date basis, our tax rate is 30.8%, down 50 basis points versus the first half of 2008 and right in line with our full year 2009 expectation. Net income was $843 million, down 14.9% and just slightly ahead of our own internal expectations. In this environment, it is not only important to look at results on a year-over-year basis, but it\u2019s also important to look at things sequentially. Please turn to slide number seven. Sales were up 12.4% or $630 million. All six businesses posted sequential increases led by Display and Graphics; Industrial and Transportation; Safety, Security and Protection Services. Selling prices were stable, currency was slightly positive and we did only one small acquisition during the quarter. So the bulk of the sequential sales increase was good, old organic volume, which is where we make the most money. Gross margins improved three full points versus the first quarter. Since Q1 was the low water mark in terms of production activity, we obviously had better fixed-cost absorption in the second quarter. Our production levels rose and estimated 15% sequentially, which added about two points to gross margin. And as we expected raw material cost continued to decline during the quarter, as we burned off older higher priced inventory. RMs boosted the gross margin by approximately 70 basis points when compared to first quarter price levels. Looking beyond the gross profit, SG&A spending was up 4.8% sequentially, but down a 150 basis points as a percent of sales, as a number of management actions are helping to keep spending under control. Many of our recent restructuring actions have impacted SG&A and of course stock option expense was lower in the second quarter versus the first $20 million to be exact. In addition, recent vocation policy changes had a significant impact on expense levels and will continue to do so for the remainder of this year, and into 2010. Research and development spending was $305 million, down 4.8% sequentially and down a point relative to sales. All the actions that I\u2019ve just mentioned, restructuring, vacation, stock options and the like apply equally to R&D. During a recession, all areas of the company including research and development need to drive operational excellence more aggressively. Operating income improved 49%, again, primarily driven was volume and the margins improved 5.5 percentage points to 22.6%. Please turn to slide eight for a recap of the balance sheet and cash flow for the quarter. 3M\u2019s strong operational capability was evident in the quarter with free cash flow of $1.3 billion, up $347 million year-on-year, or 38%. This result was driven by a combination of a lower net working capital, cash taxes and capital expenditures. As mentioned earlier, free cash flow conversion was an outstanding 160% for the second quarter, and 131% through the first six months of 2009. Free cash flow, year-to-date exceeded 2008 levels by over $100 million or 6.2%. As a result, net debt was $2.8 billion at the end of the second quarter, a reduction of $1.1 billion from March month end levels. Net working capital declined by nearly $650 million year-on-year with inventory down $574 million and accounts receivable down $487 million. The inventory turns increased slightly to 4.3, a great result concerning organic volumes were off 13.5%. Accounts payable declined $415 million versus last year primarily due to much lower CapEx, raw material and in-direct spending during the quarter. This was not a surprise to us. Dividends paid to common shareholders totaled $355 million this quarter and we continue to holdback on share repurchase activity for 2009, due to the lingering economic uncertainty. Our preference at this moment is to preserve cash and maintain optimal liquidity. That wraps up the balance sheet and cash flow. Now let\u2019s review the performance of our business units. Please turn to slide number nine. We are very fortunate to have a very outstanding and stable Health Care business in our portfolio. As you may have seen, we\u2019ve received recognition this past spring by Fortune magazine is having the number one rank business in the medical and other precision equipment category. Also for the fourth year in a row, our dental business was recognized by the Anaheim Group as the most innovative company in the dental industry. Recognition such as these are a testament to the innovative prowess of our highly talented people and the technological strength that we bring to the global healthcare industry. Second quarter sales in Health Care were $1.1 billion, up 2.2% in local currency with acquisitions and positive selling price changes more than offsetting a slight decline in organic volumes. Currency reduced second quarter sales by 7.1%. Local currency growth rates were 5% or greater in infection prevention, skin and wound care, as well as in the food safety area. Food safety is the smaller, but growing business with tremendous opportunity to leverage multiple 3M Technologies to solve customer problems in the food-processing arena. Health information systems drove sales growth of 2% in local currency and oral care was about flat in the quarter. In drug delivery systems, local currency sales declined 7% year-on-year, but rose 13% sequentially. On a geographic basis, all regions posted positive local currency sales growth. Operating profits was 11% to $344 million in Q2, and margins topped 32% driven by positive business mix along with plenty of heavy lifting by the healthcare team with the respected discretionary spending controls. Please turn to slide 10, and let\u2019s look at the Display and Graphics business. Sales in this business were $808 million, down 1.4% in local currencies, which are included over 4 percentage points of benefit from acquisitions. Currency impacts reduced sales by 3.4%, so on a total dollar basis sales declined 4.8% year-on-year. Operating profits was 9% to $201 million. Display and Graphics results were definitely a positive for us in the second quarter, starting with Traffic Safety Systems. Sales in this business increased almost 16% in local currencies, a substantial portion of which relates to our December 2008 acquisition of FAAB-Fabricauto, a leading manufacturer of French license plates. We also drove positive organic local currency sales growth in Traffic Safety Systems. As it appears that the summer road construction season has gotten off to a good start. Government stimulus has been a positive factor in parts of Asia, but thus far, we have not seen substantial stimulus driven activity in the U.S. We expect this to improve as the summer progresses. Operating profits grew by more than 20% in Traffic Safety. Sales in Optical Systems increased 4%, versus last year\u2019s second quarter and were up a hefty 52% sequentially. Volumes were impacted by two factors. First and foremost, as we have mentioned in our recent conference calls, our changes have been hard at work devising new film solutions to improve the energy efficiency of LCD panels. In short, our films enable fewer light bulbs in the back panel of an LCD screen. Those efforts are now bearing fruit and we\u2019ve seen nice improvement in film attachment rates as a result. Second, we saw a significant rise in LCD industry production levels in the second quarter, which also boosted our volumes. Some of this increase was due to replacement of channel inventories, which of course is difficult to predict going forward, but regardless the industry is healthier than it was one quarter ago. Selling price pressure is more intense than ever in optical films, therefore cost reduction remains a day-to-day priority for this team. They\u2019ve done a tremendous job in improving production yields, driving operational excellence, running an incredibly productive laboratory and commercializing new product opportunities. As anticipated, year-over-year sales were down significantly in our commercial graphics business driven by continued soft advertising spending. Please turn to slide 11, where I will recap the quarter for our Consumer and Office business. Once again our Consumer and Office team did a fine job in the quarter despite substantial near-term headwinds. Negative consumer sentiment is of course impacting retail store traffic. And on the corporate side, lower employment levels are negatively reducing office supply purchases in most companies. In the face of these challenges, our team delivered operating income of $208 million, up 11% year-on-year and sales of $866 million resulting in a 24% operating margin. While sales were down 7.8% almost five points of that was due to foreign currency translation. Sales in local currencies were down 2.9%, which includes about a 0.5 from acquisitions. We\u2019ve recently acquired Futuro, a leading supplier of compression supports and hosiery and just this month we announced the acquisition of Ace brands from Becton, Dickinson. These are highly recognizable brands that nicely complement our existing consumer retail healthcare business, and we\u2019re becoming more relevant to the drug store channel. Looking across the various product lines, sales growth was strongest in consumer health care and including products for the home. Sales to the do-it-yourselfer and office channels were down year-on-year for the reasons I stated earlier. However, sales pick up nicely on a sequential basis. Back-to-school orders typically began to impact us in July. However, this year we saw those orders begin in late June, as retailers attempted to drive more customers to their stores earlier. We typically increased advertising and merchandising investments in order to drive back-to-school and holiday sales in the second half of the year, and this year will be no different. So, you should expect to see the margins decline from Q2 levels. On a regional basis, sales and local currencies increased at a mid single-digit rate in Latin America and were down just slightly in both the U.S. and Asia Pacific. Europe posed a challenge again this quarter with local currency sales declining 13%. And of course, we recently announced the appointment of Joe Harlan to lead our Consumer and Office business starting July 1. I know Joe will do a great job leading this business following in the footsteps of the very successful carrier of Dr. Moe Nozari, who retired at the end of the second quarter. So in summary, despite continued challenging market conditions, the Consumer and Office business delivered great results. Now please turn to slide 12, where I will discuss details of the Safety, Security and Protection Service business. A number of cross currents impacted this business in the second quarter. First half, the week industrial economy continued to be a drag on sales in many parts of our Safety, Security and Protection business such as, frozen protection, roofing granules, commercial cleaning supplies and manufacturing related sales of personal protection equipment. This was fully expected and for the most parts sales in these areas generally finish in line with our recent expectations. At the same time, we saw a tremendous sequential surge in respiratory orders in the second quarter related to the recent outbreak of the H1N1 virus. So H1N1 became news early in the quarter, our factories have been running all out in an attempt to meet the surgeon demand and we have back orders extending beyond the end of this calendar year. But last time, we encountered a so-called X factor in this business was in 2006 with the SARS virus. Since then, we have expanded our global market leadership by adding more than 40% additional respirator capacity around the world; including Korea, the U.S., the United Kingdom, Russia and China. And recently we approved an additional investment for an incremental 10% of added capacity to address the anticipated stronger demand through 2009 and into 2010. It isn\u2019t always easy to time these investments, particularly in businesses that encounter such larger surges. But in this case, we timed them pretty well. We estimate the sales in the second quarter were boosted by approximately $15 million related to H1N1. Safety, Security and Protection sales declined 19% in the second quarter to $794. In local currency terms, sales declined 10.6% and currency impact reduced sales by 7.4%. Divestitures impacted sales growth by a negative 1% in the quarter. Operating income was $181 million with a 22.8% margin. On a business development note, recently the U.K. government awarded their passport business to a competitor starting in late 2010. We remain very confident in the future of our passport business and the growth prospects remaining outstanding. But needleless to say, we have more work to do in offsetting the U.K. business with additional country business. Please turn to slide number 13 for a look at our largest business, Industrial and Transportation. Sales in Industrial and Transportation topped $1.7 billion in the second quarter, down 15.3% in local currencies and down 20.7% in dollar terms. Currency impacts reduced sales by 5.4%. The Industrial and Transportation team continues to manage very well through a substantial end market declines. Global auto production was down 25% to 30%. Therefore, there is no surprise to see that our local currency sales in our automotive OEM business were down 28% on a year-on-year basis. Sequentially, however, sales didn\u2019t rise 20%. Versus last year\u2019s production levels, the home appliance market is in a double-digit decline as well, along with other industry such as furniture, metalworking and many others. While things have not gotten sequentially worse in these markets, they haven\u2019t gotten substantially better either. So we continue to manage our costs very carefully, drive cash flow aggressively and work with our customers to identify a new and innovative solutions to their problems. There were a few bright spots in Industrial and Transportation in the second quarter as well, however. We saw some pick up in consumer electronic related orders, which positively impacted our industrial adhesives and tape business. Again we are hopeful that this trend continues, but maintaining caution nonetheless. Another highlight was our automotive aftermarket business, where local currency sales grew towards in the high single digits. This growth was driven primarily through acquisitions as we have made some excellent complementary acquisitions in the space during the past year. Finally, we also drove high single-digit local currency sales growth in the newly formed renewable energy business. Operating income was a strong $329 million in the second quarter and margins were 19.1%, a strong result concerning the degree of the sales decline. Importantly, margins improved by almost seven percentage points on a sequential basis, a testament to the aggressive operational excellence and restructuring efforts that this team has executed. Please turn to slide 14, where I will comment on the performance of the Electro and Communications business. End market declines have been steepest in this business particularly in telecom infrastructure and commercial construction. We are still living through the very difficult sales comparisons versus last year. Sales were $551 million in the quarter, a decline of 27.5% year-on-year. Sales declined 23.8% in local currency and the strong dollar reduced sales by another 3.7%. Local currency declines were broad-based across the various business units. Our business seems have been aggressive in facing many of these headwinds with intense focus on cost reduction and cash flow. The more interesting story in Electro and Communications is the sequential change. Sales improved nearly 15% sequentially and profits tripled versus the first quarter to $74 million. Operating margins improved by 8.4 percentage points sequentially, finishing the quarter at 13.4%. This is well below our recent performance and our long-term expectations. But nonetheless, it was an outstanding effort considering the market conditions. Finally, as a follow on to Joe Harlan being named to the new head of Consumer and Office. We have a new Executive Vice President, Electro and Communications as well. Dr. Joaquin Delgado took the reins effective July 1. Joaquin was born in Spain and has over 20 years experience with the company. A chemist by training, he has experienced in a number of 3M businesses, as well as our corporate labs. Joaquin did a stint as Managing Director of our Korean subsidiary. Before being appointed to his most recent position of Vice President of Electronics Markets Materials Division. Joaquin is a tremendous leader, and I know that the entire Electro and Communications Business is in very capable hands. That wraps up my discussion of the business results. So now, I will turn it back to George, who will update you on our 2009 outlook. George?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Thank you very much, Pat. Before we get to your questions, I\u2019d like to address our outlook for the rest of the year. As a start, I\u2019ll take you back to what we said last quarter about how we view economic conditions and how we\u2019re managing our business. End market demand has increased for LCD TVs clearly, particularly the lower energy versions, which use 3M\u2019s multilayered optical films. This has resulted in an improved business conditions there. Just for your information by surface area, demand for these types of films has more than doubled in last few months, and our margin mix has also improved from the less profitable BEF to DBEF films. So we\u2019re also getting attachment rate as well as end market volume. H1N1 face mass volume demand is huge and should continue robust throughout the year. We\u2019re adding flexible capacity for this issue as Pat mentioned as fast as we can. We recently authorized $20 million in new capital for this activity. Automotive aftermarket, aerospace, renewable energy and [the appetite] demand remains good too. But apart from these few fireflies, the fact remains that we see no meaningful improvement in most major industries yet, automotive manufacturing, general industrial and housing for example. Slight ones, yes, but too soon to call any victories. You can see this betterment, a big challenge in our industrial segment results. In addition, we see no signs of improvements yet in Europe as their economies continue to lack the U.S. and in some cases marginally worsen. Keynes told us that the economic recoveries are only possible and sustainable when there is real improvement in end market demand. Despite the fact that, we all want to believe it, it isn\u2019t happening robustly just yet. It\u2019s hard to forecast the precise shape of the recovery and even harder to describe it verbally to you here over the phone. But our expectations have always been that the profile would comprise a portion caused by a sharp fall off in demand due to destocking. We saw that in the fourth quarter, the first and part of the second quarter and flattish, but show the economic bottom then some fast restocking in selected industries, which we saw in last part of the second quarter. This will be followed by a flat spot as I call it, as end market and wholesale demand comes into equilibrium, and after that the earnings recovery would just gradually follow economic activity upwards in synchronism. That flat spot, if it comes may begin in the late third or the fourth quarter. So in light of these realities, we are sticking with the fundamentals of our plan, controlling costs, generating cash and ethically driving sales. We may, will be accused of being conservative, but in our view, it\u2019s too early and too uncertain to take another path and celebrate some kind of recovery. The green shoots are certainly there, we admit that. We just want to make sure that they aren\u2019t weeds. As you recall, we said that because 3M essentially a short cycle company. The performance of the economy is key to how we view and forecast the balance of the year. Despite, our natural caution on the positive side, history and experience teach us that 3M will recover considerably faster than companies in longer cycle industries. What the second quarter brings the life is the underlying strength of the 3M-business model. Its diversity, combined with discipline, provides a platform for cash generation performance even in the most challenging of conditions. So we\u2019re going to maintain that discipline going forward even as we make plans to selectively increase our growth investments in the second half. With the second quarter complete, we now believe that organic sales volumes for 2009 will come in somewhat better than we said in the first quarter and between minus 10% and minus 13%. And that EPS will come in somewhere in the band $4.10 to $4.30. In conclusion, we are going to stay focused on cash generation as we work through the downturn. Plus strategic investments in growth platforms as the best way to make 3M emerge an even stronger company than we were even a year ago. We want to make sure we invest enough in new growth and technology areas as money frees up and not fall into a trap of persistent short-term outlooks. While it may be too soon to call it recovery, it\u2019s not too soon to remind ourselves of the dream of higher growth and to take the steps to make sure it happens. Again, we are heartened by the power of our business model and by the professionalism and dedication of people around the world. And we are more convinced than ever that 3M is a superior and profitable investment for you all. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to you for your questions. Thank you very much.\nOperator: (Operating Instructions) Our first question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Begleiter: Good morning.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Good morning, Dave.\nPatrick D. Campbell: Good morning, Dave.\nDavid Begleiter: George, what portion of the cost savings and reductions or structural and permanent, first what will come back once demand recovers?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Probably a substantial portion of the people downsizing David, are obviously any plant closures and sales of plants like the Belle Mead one are also permanent. So if I was making an educated guess right now, I would say probably 70% or 80% of the people reductions are permanent and locked in. On other sort of overall cost reductions obviously they will go back up Dave as a sales flex. Obviously that the benefits that we\u2019ve got from vacation policy adjustments in a couple of years time, they will pop back, but again they\u2019re small enough to be handled. Pat, have you got any other\u2026\nPatrick D. Campbell: I\u2019d say, I think it\u2019s a good answer. The vacation accrual will pop back overtime because that\u2019s kind of a one-time benefit we\u2019ll get over \u201909 and \u201910. I think where we\u2019ve frozen kind of our merit plan is so forth in 2009. We will have to decide what we want to do on a going forward basis. But to a large degree, what we\u2019re putting in place are more structural changes. And I think as you know Dave, part of the challenges is as business improves, it\u2019s how you control the cost structure on the upside. And I think in the past, you\u2019ve seen as our margins grew from say 17% or so back in 2000 up to 22, 23. One of our focus areas is making sure that I\u2019ll call our overhead costs and so forth doesn\u2019t grow as volume returns. So I think it gives us a good opportunity in a very good leverage factor going forward.\nDavid Begleiter: And can you get back to those 22% plus margins perhaps in 2011, as a recovery occurs?\nPatrick D. Campbell: I guess Dave we just ran 22.6 in this quarter, okay. And I guess you can argue that, there is a slight benefit of vacation so forth. Again, volumes on 13.5% from last year. So our underlying margin capability is actually better than our previous peaks. The choice we have to make is the trade-off between the growth and margins as we go forward.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you.\nGeorge W. Buckley: The answer to your question is a very clear yes, David.\nDavid Begleiter: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with Barclays Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Good morning, guys.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Good morning, Shannon.\nPatrick D. Campbell: Good morning.\nShannon O'Callaghan: So on the price cost side of things; you mentioned the sequential benefit in the quarter. As you look at the costs coming into your pipeline now, and outlook for pricing I mean how do you expect that benefit to flow through the rest of the year?\nPatrick D. Campbell: I would say, it ought to remain somewhat constant through the year. We\u2019re very obviously aware of what we see price pressure at the back half of the year. But I would also say, Shannon that I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve actually reached the low on our material costs yet. I think we have still a little ways to go there. So I think the spread that we had here in the second quarter, there is no reason to believe that won\u2019t hold through Q3 and Q4 as we see it right now.\nGeorge W. Buckley: I think Shannon in stasis the way we think about this is managing the spread between price and material cost reduction. Obviously, it\u2019s more likely if you have a environment of high commodity inflation, it\u2019s an environment that you\u2019re more likely to be able to get price and vice-versa. And so I think in large measure, if pricing got tough, it probably means that cost reductions got better. And they kind of run in synchronize maybe with a little bit of sort of lag and overlap at each end of the transition from one sort of phase to the other. So I think it bodes fairly well for the future on at least that element of our cost structure.\nPatrick D. Campbell: Shannon I guess to clarify, you have to be little bit careful as you think about this, because our price increase of course will wane through the year, okay. Because we are still kind of really reporting, I\u2019ll call it, carryover price increases that we\u2019ve already got in the marketplace. So as the year progresses, our reported price will continue to go down, but if you look at it more from the absolute level, our expectation is that, we\u2019ll hang on to as much as that is possible. At the same time that we expect material prices to be a little more favorable.\nShannon O'Callaghan: So the gross margin you saw on this quarter isn\u2019t unusual then?\nPatrick D. Campbell: I don\u2019t think so. If you go back and look at our history, Q1 was way more of the aberration in our historical trend. Now the good part of that I think Shannon and I think of it and your back to Dave\u2019s comments is, we are able to get to those gross margin levels at a lower volume level now, which tells me that fundamentally we\u2019ve enhanced the overall profitability and margin capability of the company.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Okay, thanks. Just one more, George you mentioned, selectively adding to growth investments in the second half of the year. I mean how much have those been reined in and how much would do you like them to come back? Is it in the form of R&D ticking back up or what you do have in mind?\nGeorge W. Buckley: I don\u2019t think they been reined in so much. We always at the beginning of the year Shannon, we kind of have a bucket of things that we can pick from to invest in. Obviously you can imagine with a tough economy and murky economy out there, a lot of them we just held. So it\u2019s really a question of not so much what got canceled, but what we just slid to the right. And there is a whole host of those and some of we\u2019ve actually activated internally just recently. One on oxidental components, one on sort of heavy industries, shipbuilding and railroads and those sorts of things. So we will sort of accelerate some of our investments in those today. But in terms of the question on big R&D programs, as Pat had mentioned earlier in his commentary, there really hasn't been any change in that. You would see some marginal movements in the R&D numbers simply because we followed the same kind of policies in the R&D staffing levels on vacation and on control of incidental and non-core expenses, we follow the same sort of pattern there that we have everywhere else. But I think the time maybe coming very soon and kind of Pat hinted this because of the margin structure where we can actually release some more money to these investments that will propagate growth. And we have a relatively long list of these things, Shannon. The nice thing is some years ago, we kind of had a lot of money and were short of ideas. Right now we are a little bit short of money. We have got lots of ideas. So I think it\u2019s going to be fine as the year goes forward.\nPatrick D. Campbell: Shannon and I guess the other thing and probably to maybe anticipate a question that will come up is I\u2019ve said on your previous calls that our Health Care margins as an example are probably running a little on the hot side right now. And realistically, we will probably put a little more investment in that business. Our long-term margin expectations in that business is more on the high 20s than it is the low 30s. So over time, but that\u2019s not like, we\u2019re going invest a huge amount of money. We\u2019ll just gradually ease some spending. We talked about the investments we\u2019re going to make here an additional respiratory capacity that we did. And then I\u2019d say a little bit, we\u2019ll probably look at some of our emerging market opportunities, places like China and the like and maybe start to accelerate some of the spending. And then, our traditional pattern is that we do increase our spending the back half of the year around our consumer business. Our OEM really on the ad and merch side. So those will probably be the ticket areas that you want to follow.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Okay. Great. I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Winoker: Good morning, guys.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Good morning.\nSteven Winoker: Just a follow-up to Shannon\u2019s question. What\u2019s your product, what was your product vitality rate running, the index?\nPatrick D. Campbell: It\u2019s running at 27. Is what it was at the end of the second quarter. It happened to be benefit a little bit, because of our very strong optical film sales in the second quarter. There is a number of new products that they hit there, but we\u2019re running at mid to high 20s now.\nSteven Winoker: Okay. And in terms of the restructuring activities, I know you\u2019ve talked about sort of equal, equal action across the R&D function, but if you look at the early retirement and folks sort of walking out the door. Has it been in any way disproportional within R&D or less proportional?\nPatrick D. Campbell: No, I would say it\u2019s probably more proportional and when I did indicate that we will be replacing people out of the early retirement program. We are being very cautious as it where we place those people back into the organization, but R&D obviously is at the top of the list there.\nSteven Winoker: So you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re losing sort of organizational knowledge in that key function?\nPatrick D. Campbell: No. No not at all.\nGeorge W. Buckley: I think if I remember Steve, the retirement number from R&D was a little over a 100 of the 700 and is also an opportunity to set at the sort of cherry pickers\u2019 charter. There are a lot of absolutely superb Ph.D. doing post-doctoral work right now that we\u2019d like to go out and get. And so as Pat had mentioned earlier, one portion of that replacement will come from executing that cherry pickers\u2019 charter. It is one of the opportunities right now for us to get a lot of really, really talented staff that admittedly can replace some of the experienced staff, but it is not become a problem for us.\nSteven Winoker: Okay. And then on supply chain restructuring again and I know you\u2019ve talked about how your efforts on that front have changed over time. In light of this quarter\u2019s strong result, how are you thinking about those efforts going forward now?\nPatrick D. Campbell: I guess Steve I don\u2019t think they\u2019re significantly different than we talked last quarter. There is a couple of elements of that strategy part of it was kind of unpicking the hairball that we had. That continues on as a day-to-day effort. And I think if you look at our inventory performance and our gross margin improvement, nothing being to attributed to our supply chain moves, but obviously as a enabler of making that happen. Some of the longer-term investments we are making, we did pull back on a little bit just because of the growth rates not there right now. So we\u2019ve pushed those off a little bit and we call some of the over super hub sites, but our supply chain initiative remains going very well in this quarter part of a restructuring relates to cleaning up part of our supply chains in a few of our businesses. So we just keep working at it on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\nSteven Winoker: On that super hub and other part of it. Can you sort of quantify how much you are planning on spending in that area then, I mean versus what you are thinking about historically?\nGeorge W. Buckley: It\u2019s not a huge number, Steve I would say the reality as we\u2019ve probably pulled back a couple $100 million of spending is we kind of give you the order of magnitude.\nSteven Winoker: Okay, great. And then last question on the $700 million that you\u2019ve been talking about for cost savings for the year, and I know you\u2019ve talked about temporary versus permanent et cetera but how of that do you think you realize so far?\nPatrick D. Campbell: I mean 700 people you are talking about?\nSteven Winoker: No, this is the original when you started talking about your brief \u201909 savings?\nPatrick D. Campbell: This goes back to your supply chain question.\nSteven Winoker: Yeah. Well that and all the restructuring, this was a gross number you put out there?\nPatrick D. Campbell: Yeah.\nSteven Winoker: Before.\nPatrick D. Campbell: I guess, offhand I don\u2019t have a kind of an up-to-date number on that Steve.\nPatrick D. Campbell: But I would say that we\u2019ve probably taken on more restructuring since we did that number.\nSteven Winoker: Okay.\nPatrick D. Campbell: So the reality is the numbers probably, if I was probably give you a new updated long-term number probably would be higher that.\nSteven Winoker: Okay. All right. Thanks very much.\nPatrick D. Campbell: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Good morning Jeff.\nJeffrey Sprague: George, your comments about restocking are interesting, I'm not really hearing that anywhere else yet and I just wonder first, do you actually see customers stocking out in certain places, late in Q1 or early in Q2 driving that, or what do you think really is behind it?\nPatrick D. Campbell: Yeah, Jeff. This is Pat, here. I\u2019ll just try to deal with that kind of first part. As we talk about destocking it\u2019s kind of an interesting I guess concept as to where to put, of course as an example consumer electronics. Okay, consumer electronics had basically run completely to inventory to the bottom in the first quarter, basically at shutdown production almost maybe 25% utilization or so. So the reality is there is, what\u2019s happening is, there is a number of these industries like LCD that is now starting to ramp back up. There is a piece of that, okay, that of course is replenishment of the system in that effectively they were down here in the first quarter altogether. To some degree those industries are segments that basically took drastic actions here in the first quarter around production. There is no doubt in Q2 here, okay. One thing just going on is there\u2019s some rebuild of that. Now, we also honestly believe that there will not be a inventories and stocking levels will not go back to where they were when we went into the situation. So, one of the challenges are of course going forward is, we think that the overall demand level including inventory replenishment will be in a lower level than where it was and say the \u201907, \u201908 period before the industries started collapse on us.\nGeorge W. Buckley: I don\u2019t thing the destocking issue is a serious one, but I think in those industries we should have persistent slumps in sales, automotive, housing I think there is still a little bit of bleed off. But I don\u2019t want you to think that we\u2019re exaggerating that, as a feature, still it\u2019s just kind of bleed drip-drip stuff. Certainly I think we are at the point where we\u2019re turning more toward either to restocking or an expectation of restocking.\nJeffrey Sprague: And then just, to drill into a couple of businesses, dental, I think you characterized as flat, but it sounds like maybe that had some acquisition benefit in it\u2026\nGeorge W. Buckley: Yeah.\nJeffrey Sprague: How was dental organic?\nGeorge W. Buckley: I\u2019d say it\u2019s in about down five. The dental portion was a little more favorable than the orthodontic piece. The orthodontic piece was hit a little harder, that\u2019s probably down more of a low double-digit number. But the dental, the dental piece was a little bit stronger than that.\nPatrick D. Campbell: In sort of one of the things have surprised us that robustness of our dental business. I think has pleasantly surprised us. We expect it to perform well, but it has seems to done better than many of our contemporaries.\nJeffrey Sprague: And just on cash deployment, we\u2019ve kind of tap danced around it a little bit on this call, but I mean clearly the economy is bad, but also you look to be in pretty good shape from a liquidity and cash standpoint. Why not go out a little bit farther on the limb on share repurchase or something here. Is there an inflection point later in the year or early next year where we see something change?\nPatrick D. Campbell: Yeah. I guess Jeff good question and I\u2019ll keep taking that question for probably a couple of quarters going here. We\u2019re going to manage our situation cautiously here as we look through the rest of the year. I\u2019ve got to keep an eye on our pension plan to make sure that pension plan where it ends up the calendar year, what kind of funding level we need in it. We're going to put $600 million of stock in it here in the third quarter. So we\u2019ll manage our cost, we\u2019ll keep an eye on your repurchase as an option. But at this point in time it\u2019s not\u2026.\nGeorge W. Buckley: The great thing Jeff, which is kind of what you\u2019re hinting at is that the improving cash position gives us choices. We haven\u2019t yet made those choices finally, but really nothing is off the table. So we'll deal with those appropriately as we as Pat and I, feel it\u2019s timely to do so. So please don't worry.\nJeffrey Sprague: Well, I don't follow the logic though of putting stock in the pension plan. Given the liquidity, what's the thought process there?\nPatrick D. Campbell: Well. We have a long-term need in the plan. We are continuing to manage our credit rating and the like. At this point in time, we think we\u2019ve got a little some flexibility there. So we had decided a little bit earlier on to put stock, stock in the plan. We think it\u2019s a good investment for the plan as well.\nJeffrey Sprague: That will all hit in Q3?\nPatrick D. Campbell: It will hit in Q3. Yes.\nJeffrey Sprague: Okay. Thank you.\nPatrick D. Campbell: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Good morning, Deane.\nPatrick D. Campbell: Good morning.\nDeane Dray: I might have missed it, but George in your opening remarks you talked about the, you hinted at the progression of organic volume through the quarter April, May, June, how did that look?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Pat can get you the precise numbers. April was not that much different than March, Deane. It was still a slow month. And then the growth accelerated as the quarter went on and obviously we had a pretty good June. And it was pretty much as we\u2019d expected. When we \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if you were involved in these conversations, Deane. But when we were trying to figure out how to do our planning for the year. We kind of made some assumptions about how the channel would clear the excess inventory and when a little bit of refill was going to start and we actually calculated it was going to begin happening in June. And oddly enough it did. So, I\u2019m not sure if that was pure luck or brilliance on the part of the financial people here. But we got that right. So I expect that is going to continue for a little while and I mentioned in my remarks, Deane, a sort of flat spot, where the whatever restocking might be taking place might sort of back off again as people feel they\u2019re up to snuff on their inventory levels. And then it\u2019s one of the reasons why Pat and I are little bit cautious, we want to see if that pans out in the way that we think it might. Or if it does to what, how serious it might be, how flat it might be or whether it inverts little bit and you have some kind of mild asymmetric [double U]. So it seems to be panning out, pretty much as we are forecast so far. And I expect that maybe towards the end of the third quarter, perhaps it is in the fourth quarter, we might see some moderation of that. And we will just have to see how that goes Deane. But that\u2019s kind of how I'm thinking this inventory thing and restocking thing happens.\nDeane Dray: George, that\u2019s very helpful. I think what\u2019s interesting is when you talk about the planning process what distinguishes 3M here is that you\u2019ve provided earnings guidance, but you\u2019ve also provided conceptually the milestones that you expect and how to play out. And surprisingly or not you kind of hit each one of those very nicely, you\u2019ve got to be careful, but they might be asking you to do some economic advising in Washington soon?\nGeorge W. Buckley: I actually Deane it\u2019s a real quick thought. Joe Harlan said to me on Monday at our management meeting, he said \"George you no longer qualify as an economist\", I said \"Why is that Joe\", he said \"Because you forecasted it before it happened\", rather than after.\nDeane Dray: Very funny math. But if we also look at what you all talked about last quarter and Pat commented this as well in terms of the recovery path. So we\u2019ve talked about some of the restocking and that flat spot, but last quarter you\u2019ve talked about some of the obstacles being business credit and unemployment. And how do those two conditions look today versus your recovery path plan?\nGeorge W. Buckley: I think on the unemployment, the number continues to creep up Deane. And I hold a thesis, whether I'm right or not remain yet to be seen. But I hold the thesis that we won\u2019t see any sustainable improvement in the housing market until unemployment, the rate of unemployment stabilizes. We can all make forecast here, but I think that\u2019s likely to be in the 11% range and probably either late this year or the first quarter of next year. So I think that market is going to be slighting sideways, maybe even marginally getting worse. Of course there are going to be repos out there, bargain hunters out there that will drive some volume in certain segments. But I think the longer-term issue is this thing that I call the reset, I think Jeff [Ingle] called it something like that earlier although referring to other markets. When I was working for Emerson we had about $1.3 or $1.4 million housing starts a year. We peaked a couple of years ago at $2.2 million I don\u2019t see any reason to believe that housing starts are going to be above $10.5 million in the long run, unless some other fundamental lubricant to the economy takes place. I think automotive, so that's probably Jeff is a year away before we see that kind of moment I think. In automotive, I\u2019m a bit more optimistic, there is a certain sort of replenishment turnover is necessary in automotive and they may see a little bit of a ding, perhaps 10% down. But I don't expect them to see the kind of the real retrenchment, shall we say that you might see in housing. So those things, I think run into plan. They\u2019ll probably take anywhere between another two quarters and another four quarters to work out. On general industrial, obviously in automotive that will pull through some of the general industrial manufacturing. That will probably respond a little bit faster in my mind. And obviously, we\u2019re going to have the pull from consumer electronics for a little while, which is going to be helpful. And we\u2019ll have some sustainable growth that comes from H1N1. So I think overall, clearly the landscape is better, Deane. But I think there is enough stuff out there still to what to sound a note of caution in our view, and just to make sure that we don't take our eye off the ball. In turn, one of the things you always worry about is you get a great quarter like this and everybody suddenly thinks the problem has passed, well it hasn't. Because sales are still down 15%, earnings are down 15%, even though we perform extraordinarily well this quarter. We need to just keep on doing the same old same old and make sure we do the next quarter and the quarter after, until we are all sure that this thing has passed us.\nDeane Dray: George it is very helpful. And our take on that is as that you\u2019ve got enough conservative assumptions still within that forecast. And I know we\u2019ve passed an hour now, but if I could sneak one last question in regarding the business for consumer products. Have you seen anything different about customer behavior in terms of wanting to trade down from that good, better, best array of products that maybe into more private label and what might the margin impact be and share changes here at this stage?\nGeorge W. Buckley: I have to tell you the truth Deane. We haven\u2019t seen it, I know people have talked about it and I can certainly see the logic behind the thought, but in our case we haven\u2019t seen it. And there are somethings in life that people want to buy, where they get reassurance either from the brand or historical performance and maybe they end up buying less, but I\u2019m not sure that they would buy cheap. My grandmother used that line \"I'm too poor to buy cheap.\" So it hasn\u2019t been a factor of what we\u2019ve seen Deane. And I'd just remind the listeners that in many of these markets where the consumer is buying directly, we have the good, the better and the best. So for us it's really just movement backward and forward between these categories, it\u2019s not loss of volume. And the margins across these segments Deane are actually pretty good. So I\u2019m not anticipating any cataclysmic make change in margin if that worry that you expressed visit 3M. Do you\u2019ve got anything else you want to add, Pat?\nPatrick D. Campbell: No\nDeane Dray: Great, thank you very much.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Thanks Deane.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Roberts: Back-to-school season here in the U.S., maybe the next test or sort of economic recovery? You said you had early actually ordering there? Do you think the retailers actually have enough stock to have up back-to-school sales or should we at least prepare for that to be flat or week, even with even with your early ordering?\nPatrick D. Campbell: Let\u2019s say the retailers are trying to get consumers into the store. The other is a obviously, look a consumer sentiment data and so forth. And it\u2019s in troubling in a source \u2013 troubling indicator. So obviously, we are trying to pull things forward. We think there is enough stock and I guess when we made that comment John, we are talking about weeks not months okay. So it's not a huge shift forward in the activity, but it is enough to indicate we had some business here in the second quarter versus the third quarter. So I don't want to mislead you that there was a huge shift in demand, demand pull ahead. But I think they\u2019re trying to, obviously have adequate stock at least from our product standpoint. We\u2019ve adequate inventory with them to pull through. Now what we have to do is of course we have to help them in the back half of the year here with our own promotional work as well.\nJohn Roberts: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nLaurence Alexander: Seeing regionally in terms of end markets in China and Japan. And also George you used the expression \"false dawns\" as being a potential concern later in the year and into next year. Are there end markets which you view with more skepticism or that you are more wary of a false dawn?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Well, I think in the same way that we outlined earlier, that the markets we expected to respond fastest were the fast inventory turn businesses, short development cycle businesses on the way down. We expected those guys to come back faster, I think they are the guys that can turn this stuff on and off a lot faster. So you have to just wonder in the end can those TV, monitor purchases be sustained. I\u2019m not any kind of prophet of doom here, it\u2019s just that I, having lived with that industry long enough, I know they have this superb ability to turn on and shut-off almost at a moment\u2019s notice. And I think it\u2019s just something that everybody ought to just keep in mind that that could happen. I\u2019m not predicting a false dawn, I\u2019m just watching to make sure it\u2019s not one.\nLaurence Alexander: And then with respect to end market trends in Asia?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Market trends in Asia, if you\u2019ve seen our results were actually very positive relatively speaking. But again, we\u2019re led by those positive movements in electronics. Japan still is improving a little bit, but still seems to be more persistently slow than other parts of Asia. China is back to positive growth again, whether they\u2019ll return to the sort of late 20\u2019s growth that we had a couple years ago. We\u2019re probably not going to see that I don\u2019t think this year, but fundamentally the market dynamics in China, the demand profile in China is likely to be positive, and you may have heard us say in the past that our business there is China for China, although obviously some of it gets re-exported. So I think China for us will remain relatively robust, it will be pulled along or will pull along Taiwan. Korea\u2019s actually doing quite well, so overall Asia, Asia is doing okay with the exception of possibly of Japan, so we remain quite positive about it.\nLaurence Alexander: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Tusa: Hi, good morning.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Good morning Steve.\nPatrick D. Campbell: Hi, Steve.\nStephen Tusa: Just a question on the capacity you guys put in place, just before the downturn here. How is the loading of those plants going? And should we think about some of this restructuring as part of that process of changing your geographic footprint and maybe just a quick follow on, on that one. Is there any kind of whether it safely stock or extra cost that you guys were carrying kind of into this downturn, because of all that heavy investment you guys put in place before we hit the skids on the economy?\nPatrick D. Campbell: You know Steve, in my comments around respiratory products, the times there has been a fair amount of question, okay, about the timings on these investments. But when I look at and I\u2019ll just give you maybe three or four examples. Part of the investment was for a respiratory capacity in a number of different locations, both converting capacity and work in process. So that\u2019s just played out, ideal for us right now. I look at our Filtrete Filter business as still remaining in a very, very strong capacity related to that. And I\u2019m going to say optical film here for a second. Obviously there is a lot of worry about some of the investment that we are making in some of the multilayer capacity. And at the time, we probably we\u2019re looking at a higher total growth rate there, but within the last quarter, we\u2019ve needed every bit of that capacity and then plus more, okay, to actually meet the demand surge. So that piece was going very well. A number of our healthcare investments that we\u2019ve made have been very, very solid. So I\u2019m not going to try and tell you that everyone are most perfectly right. But the reality is played out even in this slower economy to a large degree, the capacity we put in place. If you go back, remember that, we are looking at specific situations where we were already short of capability, so it wasn\u2019t like we are trying to look at a long-term forecast and then try to anticipate where the market was going to go. What we were trying to do is really fill a lot of the gaps that we had now. As I previously mentioned, there are some longer-term strategic investments that we are putting in place around super hubs and so forth that were a little bit longer range that if we\u2019ve pulled back on. So the installed capacity we put in place though, at least in the second quarter here we\u2019ve had a very good utilization rates up. But part of our restructuring continues to get at some supply chains that still need to be fixed. There is no doubt that we still have certain businesses that probably need to be shrunk down a little bit. All the capacity we added were in certain fields and obviously we have other businesses and other processes that need to be downsized. So we\u2019ll continue to work on some of those restructuring actions, but it\u2019s really played out well for us in the second quarter here.\nStephen Tusa: And I guess that\u2019s my point I mean I\u2019m not thinking you guys are putting for making the investments that you made, it\u2019s a good long-term plan I\u2019m just saying that. The question is more around, is the restructuring you\u2019re doing now some of that part of this long-term planning that I guess you could use the term accelerated as oppose to taking away some of the capacity that you could use in an up turn and therefore having to add that back. So I guess that\u2019s more along the lines of the question and maybe we can\u2026\nPatrick D. Campbell: Steve, let me try to gear, because first of all not all the restructuring of course is in supply chain. A fair amount what we\u2019ve been doing of late is more I\u2019ll call back office okay, type work. But specifically in the quarter, as an example, part of the quarter restructuring is a downsizing of our Japanese manufacturing operations.\nStephen Tusa: Right.\nPatrick D. Campbell: We made a decision that Japan\u2019s probably not going to return to its prior level of demand, so we needed to ratchet down our capacity in Japan. And our few selected businesses here in the U.S. where we\u2019ve just consolidated operations, okay. So there are some supply chain moves that were a part of that, but it's just say a small piece of it.\nStephen Tusa: Right, and then one more a quick one, I mean we\u2019ve gone about an hour and 30 minutes without a question on D&G, and I just can\u2019t let it go. So I\u2019ll ask a very quick question on D&G. Is what we saw this quarter a dead cat bounce in some of the more commoditized products, or is this something that is kind of a reflection of what some of the newer products that are have the more sustainable attach rates can do for you going forward?\nGeorge W. Buckley: I think it\u2019s the latter, Steve its not a dead cat bounce. In fact the some of the products that are now launching of course we\u2019ve been sampling to manufacturers for more than a year and pressing the point about the energy efficiency into that credit, and obviously, you\u2019re helped some sort of time and circumstance, they\u2019ve responded to that. And that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing now happen, Steve. So I think this is sustainable, it\u2019s the electronic business, and those manufactures, again, are very, very able they\u2019re always going to be looking to find ways to do without something. I think it\u2019s stable for sometime who knows maybe it\u2019s one to two years. But in the end the only way you can stay ahead this game is to continue to innovate, continue to engage with your customers and the challenges that they face, continue to drive out costs, and just make sure that you\u2019re the absolute partner that they need in solving the problems that they have, most of which are concerned with improving performance and driving down cost. It is what it is, in that business. Tough industry.\nStephen Tusa: Well, it\u2019s good to know it\u2019s stable. Thanks a lot.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Thanks a lot Steve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Mcnulty with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Mcnulty: Hi, good morning just two quick questions. With all the big moves that you made in terms of cost cutting in this or throughout the second quarter. Can you quantify what the improvement we should be thinking about should be for the third quarter relative to the second?\nPatrick D. Campbell: Third versus second, I guess is \u2013 oh, I guess probably a couple cents, okay. Is the way I would, is a way I think of it.\nJohn Mcnulty: Okay, great. And then the other question with regard to your inventories they were down sequentially, your sales are up noticeably sequentially. So clearly there was a bit of destocking. Did that have any negative impact on your margins? It clearly helped your cash flow, but it did it hit your margins where when that destocking comes to an end, we may actually see even further improvement there?\nPatrick D. Campbell: I guess you could, if I understand your question right, John. It obviously could improve to the degree, obviously, our manufacturing rates and so forth improve as a result. Because you could say, if I understand your question right, because there still a little bit destocking going on? Once that turns around, obviously, our production rates should improve some more. And as if you looked at our sequential rate as we increased manufacturing utilization you can see that the pop we had on a leverage standpoint?\nJohn Mcnulty: Okay.\nGeorge W. Buckley: The other point John, that\u2019s in there is it depends on exactly where it is and I don\u2019t purport to know how much it is. But there\u2019s likely some material in the supply chain, which was produced with high cost materials that as it gets bled off and you fill that with lower cost materials, we may see some a little bit of margin help there. Of course, that\u2019s hard to plan, and hard to predict, but it is a positive John in the overall trends you see.\nJohn Mcnulty: Okay. Great, thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Feldman with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Feldman: Thanks. The Industrial and Transportation segment, was one of kind of the weaker performing segments for the moment. How much of that lagging do you think is attributable so auto specifically rather than the rest of the business there?\nPatrick D. Campbell: Well, are you saying it from a growth rate perspective now, Jason or what?\nJason Feldman: Yes, either growth or margins?\nPatrick D. Campbell: Because if I recall the numbers right, local currency growth in automotive is down 28% that\u2019s our OEM business. Our AED business actually was favorable for the quarter. So that\u2019s slightly worse than the business as a whole. So it has, I don\u2019t know probably maybe four to five points of impact on the big V as whole may be.\nJason Feldman: Okay.\nPatrick D. Campbell: And obviously as I think you\u2019ve read is that auto production is starting to ramp back up. So it\u2019s one of those things that is just will be more of a timing element that, that business should see an improvement hopefully as we go to the back half of the year.\nJason Feldman: Which is why I\u2019m asking, right because it\u2019s the part of the business, I think, that\u2019s got cleanest visibility as a discrete portion.\nPatrick D. Campbell: Right.\nJason Feldman: Okay. And then also you mentioned that you hadn\u2019t hit a low yet on raw material costs. But are there certain categories of raw materials that are becoming an issue again, it certainly looks like some commodity categories are beginning to tick up again in price. Is it just based on where you have inventory or is it just that price cost spread remains favorable?\nPatrick D. Campbell: I think Jason part of it is, of course we\u2019re on a FIFO accounting basis. So it takes a while to work through the inventory layer. So even as prices do move up and we don\u2019t have anything that I guess, I\u2019m alarmed at this point in time, but as they do move up it just takes a while to work its way through the system. So we still have, I think a quarter so here to kind of play through the bottom of the market.\nJason Feldman: So it should remain relatively favorable through the end of the year?\nPatrick D. Campbell: I would think so for the near term.\nJason Feldman: Okay. Thank you very much.\nMatt Ginter: Jason to clarify to the direct from automotive will be about three points for the total business in the quarter.\nJason Feldman: Okay.\nPatrick D. Campbell: Thank you, there you go.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Well. Thank you very much for listening ladies and gentlemen. We do appreciate it very much. We\u2019ll wrap up our call and look forward to talking to you, afterwards those who have more questions. And we look forward again to talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. You may all disconnect, and thank you for participating."}, {"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 1, "year": 2009, "date": "2009-04-24 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Welcome to the 3M first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) We would now like to turn the call over Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations for 3M.\nMatt Ginter: Good morning everyone. I\u2019m joined today by George Buckley, 3M Chairman, President and Chief Executive Office and Pat Campbell, 3M Senior Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call will summarize 3M\u2019s first quarter financial results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany our comments which you can access on 3M\u2019s Investor Relations website, at www.3m.com. The slide presentation will also be archived on our website for an extended period of time along with a replay of today\u2019s audio webcast. Please take a moment as always to read the forward-looking statement on slide two. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risk and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. As a reminder to all, we filed an 8-K with the SEC on April 9, detailing a few minor product category shifts between businesses, as well as the implementation of a new dual credit reporting model for those US based businesses that share customer channels to a certain degree. In short, this change will serve as a catalyst to encourage US businesses to sell all 3M products. The numbers presented in the press release today reflect those changes. So let\u2019s begin today\u2019s review, please turn to slide number three and I\u2019ll turn things over to George.\nGeorge Buckley: Good morning everyone and thank you very much for listening to our first quarter call. A challenging quarter unfolded pretty much as we expected with the exception that, like many of our contemporaries, the end markets were a bit tougher even then we had thought it would be. Automotive unit volumes were down 14% to 15%, with similar sized contractions to this in electronics. Housing starts continued to worsen even off an already gloomy base. Net, net we had an expected organic sales volume to be down in the range 15% to 18% but they came in slightly below that at minus 19.5%. We predicted in our last call that this quarter would be the most challenging of the recession but the overall business conditions in Q1 were even weaker then we had forecast. The run rate of sales through January, February, and March were all very similar so at the [gross] level there was no material sign of recovery yet. So it is indeed as we predicted in January, getting worse before it gets better. While its not a surprise for us one always hopes for better. What we should all celebrate however is that even with these massive volume declines, which are unprecedented in modern times for 3M, we maintained an overall operating margin at a stellar 17.1%. The good news also is that we still made our internal operating plan on earnings despite the volume shortfall. That was obviously driven by a very tight and effective cost control by our leadership team and great performance in our factories even with these significant volume declines. On an FYI basis, the movement to stock option expense from the traditional second quarter to the first quarter negatively effected quarterly earnings by $0.04 and the loss of [that option] on the shop inventory corrections we\u2019ve made in Q1, cost us about $0.07. This does not include the effect of market related volume falls. There was also a loss in converting cash to dollars in Venezuela, that cost us $0.02, and Pat will discuss all of these items further in a few minutes. We\u2019re obviously controlling all those things which are in our power to control. In the quarter we announced a reduction in staffing levels across the world by another 1,200 people and we continue to streamline our manufacturing operations. Indirect spending is running at 20% or so less then last year\u2019s levels so we have the spending buttoned up tightly without so far negatively effecting our R&D spend. We remain confirmed believers that we must still invest in innovation for as long as we can; its our future. Business conditions in our industrial and transportation segment and electro and communications, were very tough as was the consumables portion of our safety and security business. In contrast, healthcare remained reasonably robust as did consumer and office which continues to buck the trend. Display and graphics saw a large fall in sales too but oddly, we began to see growth in eco friendly TV component sales. We had steady performance in traffic safety systems, renewable energy, and personal care products as well. On the currency front a third of the total company sales decline for the quarter was due to FX impact of a negative 7.1%. In the international markets we saw an 11% FX translation headwind in the first quarter, a huge impact. But in March we saw more countries exceeding last year\u2019s local currency sales numbers then we\u2019d seen in either January or February. There is a sense that the tiniest bit of momentum is building there, even if it turns out only to be the false dawn of inventory replenishment. Those very early green shoots of improvement are as might be expected, mostly in the faster turn inventory businesses such as electronics and flat panel TVs. Pat will give you some more detail later but I was pleased to see that our inventory has fallen substantially in the quarter. We expect that this trend will continue for the next few quarters. Our internal target is to reduce inventory over the balance of the full year by the same amount that we did in Q1. Offsetting this a little, receivables increased in March for the first time in several months. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Pat for some detail on the first quarter.\nPat Campbell: Thanks George, and good morning everyone. On a GAAP reported basis earnings were $0.74 per share versus last year\u2019s $1.38. Excluding special items this quarter\u2019s earnings were $0.81 per share which as George mentioned, was a few cents above our internal plan. Pre-tax restructuring charges totaled $67 million in the first quarter or $0.07 per share. The majority of this amount related to severance costs associated with about 1,200 jobs that George just mentioned. The reductions spanned all major geographies, both particular emphasis on the US, Latin America, and Western Europe. On a business by business basis, the most significant reductions were in industrial and transportation, our largest segment, and one that has been heavily impacted by the recession and in corporate, related to ongoing downsizing of our back office operations. These reductions will save 3M $70 million annually with $40 million in 2009. Restructuring is never easy but right sizing our cost base is absolutely necessary in light of much lower demand levels. We have tried to be prudent yet proactive with restructuring during this recession and since the second quarter of last year we have reduced our global work force by 4,700 positions. On top of this, we have also taken our significant number of contractors, we have furloughed or temporarily laid off well over 1,000 others in response to slower sales. The challenge of course is to balance short-term demand declines with longer-term resource needs. We continue to work this balance every day. You will see additional actions from 3M in the second quarter, the size, and scope of which are still being determined. We had a few other items effecting both reported and adjusted Q1 earnings that many of you may not or could not possibly have known about. The first related to stock option expense where we just recently changed the timing of our annual employee stock option grant from May to February. If you will recall the retirement eligible portion of the annual option grant must be expensed at the time of the grant. Now that we grant options in Q1 versus Q2 in previous years, the expense has shifted forward by one quarter. This added about $0.04 per share of costs to this quarter that was not in last year\u2019s Q1 results. Full year 2009 option expense will be very similar to 2008. The details of this change were spelled out in our annual 10-K but I know that some of you have waited to update your models until after earnings. Second, we absorbed approximately $0.02 per share of costs related to our decision to swap Venezuelan Bolivars into US dollars. Economic conditions in Venezuela have continued to deteriorate with escalating inflation pressuring the currency. We are aggressively  managing the cash flow risk as a result. We expect to initiate further such swaps in 2009 costing somewhere in the range of $0.02 to $0.03 per share spread over the next three quarters. Lastly, we aggressively reduced inventory levels in the first quarter which negatively impacted gross margins by about 1.5 percentage points or the equivalent of about $0.07 per share. Earnings exceeded our internal plan and after considering these items that may not have been factored into all your models fully, we believe our results were more favorable then they may appear on the surface. Let\u2019s take a look at first quarter sales performance on slide five, this was a quarter unlike any that most of us have ever seen and while our businesses fought for every sales dollar, the degree of decline in some of our key markets could not be overcome. For example, in consumer electronics global manufacturing output contracted by anywhere between 20% and 50%. Another example is automotive OEM where global production is expected to decline year on year by almost 30% in 2009. In the first quarter North America alone light vehicle production declined by 50%. Taken together, electronics and automotive comprised almost one quarter of our revenues. A number of other served industries declined at double-digit rates as well. Digging into the numbers, worldwide 3M sales declined 21.3% in the first quarter. Organic volumes declined 19.5% versus a previous expectation of down 15% to 18% and the stronger US dollar reduced first quarter sales by about 7%. On the positive side, we increased global selling prices by over 2% and acquisitions added over three points to sales. Organic volumes declines were most severe in Asia Pacific at 24% driven largely by the previously mentioned contraction in the electronics, automotive, and basic manufacturing. This had a significant impact on our display and graphics, electro and communications, and industrial and transportation businesses. The bright spot for APac was in healthcare which posted positive mid single-digit growth rates for the quarter. US organic volumes declined 19.6% with healthcare and consumer office declining in the mid single-digit range while our more economically sensitive businesses such as electro and communications and industrial and transportation posted organic volume declines north of 30%. Organic volumes declined 17% in Europe and 14% in the combined Latin America, Canada region. On a more positive note, we have been able to hold prices such that last year\u2019s increases provided a net year on year benefit in Q1 of just over 2%. Prices rose 3.5% in the US, 1.9% in Europe, and 8.7% in the combined Latin America and Canada region. Of course, much of the increase in Latin America was a direct offset to the impact of the strong US dollar. Price declines by 1.5% in Asia Pacific, this was all electronics related so there is no surprise there. On a worldwide basis, sales in local currencies declined 13.9%. Our strongest performers were healthcare at plus 2% and consumer office which was flat year on year. Elsewhere in the portfolio sales in local currencies declined by 3.6% in safety, security, and protection services, 21% in industrial and transportation, 27% in display and graphics, and 30% in electro and communications. Turn to slide six please, despite sales being down 21% we delivered an outstanding 17.1% operating margin in Q1. Our business teams are really driving operational excellence to the bottom line during this difficult economic period. Gross margins were 45.9%, down two and a half points from last year\u2019s first quarter with declining volumes and inventory reductions playing the most significant roles. Many of our customers and most of our own businesses shut down their operations for some period of time in the first quarter. Typically we experience this in the fourth quarter but obviously this is a different time. We successfully reduced inventories in Q1 which helped our cash flow, reduced gross margins by an estimated point and a half. Regardless that\u2019s the right way to run the business particularly in this recession and although raw materials in general have declined we turn mostly high priced inventory in Q1 given that we used FICO accounting. Also the previously mentioned Venezuelan currency cost was booked to cost of goods sold, this adjustment reduced gross margins by a little over 30 basis points. SG&A spending discipline was good in Q1. Costs were down 10% year on year which obviously was not enough to keep up with the volume decline but still reflects a lot of hard work by 3Mers in every business in every corner of the world. We have talked extensively to you about our efforts to hold the line in G&A expense and in fact we reduced these expenses by 14% in the quarter. Our teams have gotten the message that maintaining cost discipline during this extraordinary recession is critical. R&D expense was down 8.7% year on year but up a point as a percent of sales to 6.3%. As we said many times during recessions like this, all areas of the company need to tighten their belt including the labs but we are resisting the temptation to cut so deep as to jeopardize programs that will seat future growth. We believe the 6% to sales is a healthy level of investment in the business. Operating income was $870 million, down 42% which again was above our expectations. This [negative leverage] was not surprising considering our high gross margins, coupled with a 19.5% organic volume decline but bear in mind that the inverse also holds true. Net interest expense increased $19 million driven primarily by higher net debt levels and lower yields on cash deposits. The first quarter tax rate was 30.3%, down one and half points year on year due to continued excellent tax planning efforts and of course lower profit levels. Just a few years ago our tax rate was well north of 32% so I am pleased that we continue to make steady and sustainable progress on this front. For 2009 in total we anticipate a tax rate slightly below 31%. Net income was $563 million, down 43%. As I mentioned earlier earnings per share was $0.81, a decline of 41%. Now let\u2019s turn our attention to the balance sheet and cash flow on slide number seven. Net working capital declined by a healthy $605 million year on year. Inventory declined by $361 million and inventory turns declined slightly to four at quarter end. Breaking down the $361 million of inventory decline, foreign exchange translation reduced the balance by $287 million, however acquisitions net of divestitures added $172 million for the quarter. The remaining inventory reduction of $246 million represents the underlying difference between our factory output and sales. We made some good progress in Q1 but we have more to go as our 2009 inventory goal is to improve by a minimum of a half a turn. Accounts receivable decreased $677 million year on year and turns were 6.6 at quarter end. Again going through the pieces, foreign currency translation reduced receivables by $353 million and acquisitions net of divestitures added $144 million to the year on year balance. The underlying reduction in receivables was therefore $468 million which of course was directly related to a slower overall sales. When we began to see the US economy slow in late 2007 we immediately put additional focus on managing customer credit and have heightened the awareness across our global operations as well. We are seeing some slowdown in customer payments during this period of tight credit but thus far nothing of an alarming nature and we will remain prudently cautious in extending terms until we are more confident that overall economic conditions and credit availability are back to normal levels. Accounts payable declined $433 million versus last year primarily due to much lower CapEx, raw material, and indirect spending during the quarter. Free cash flow declined by $248 million year on year to $451 million. Net income declined by $470 million largely offset by a $461 million improvement in working capital performance. CapEx declined by $54 million to $244 million in the quarter. We expect full year CapEx to be $900 million or down 40% versus 2008. Pension related contributions increased by $74 million year on year and restructuring cash payments increased by $96 million. Finally as many of you know, we have redesigned our incentive comp system. Until recently payments were made quarterly based upon the quarter\u2019s performance, whereas now they are paid in the first quarter following our assessment of annual business results. This resulted in $55 million of higher cash outflows in the first quarter which of course is offset in the other three quarters of the year. Traditionally our free cash flow conversion in the first quarter is the weakest of each year due to the higher March sales compared to December which negatively impacts our first quarter working capital performance. Such was the case again this year. Regardless, free cash flow conversion was 87% versus 70% in last year\u2019s first quarter. Were it not for the timing change related to incentive comp, conversion would have been slightly greater then 100%. We continue to target a minimum of 100% conversion for 2009 in total. Dividends paid to common shareholders totaled $354 million this quarter. We once again raised the per share dividend by 2% in February which was the 51st consecutive annual increase for the company. Not many companies have this track record. Finally as I mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call our cash flow forecast for 2009 reflects no share repurchases. Our preference at this moment is to preserve cash and maintain optimum liquidity. That wraps up my comments on total company performance, now let\u2019s quickly review the performance of our business units. I will review those segments most impacted by the current economic climate first, then conclude with those less impacted. Please turn to slide number eight. The industrial and transportation team is doing an outstanding job managing through end market declines the like of which the business has never experienced. Three industries in particular, automotive, electronics and appliances, touch about one-half of industrial and transportation sale base. So for example when you see 50% declines in first quarter North American auto builds, a 25% contraction in January production of major appliances, and a 20% to 50% decline in global electronics, you can understand why our first quarter sales are what they were. Sales in the business declined 28% to $1.58 billion and margins declined 10.2 points to 12.4%. Sales in local currencies declined 21% including a 2.8% benefit from acquisitions. We have acquired some outstanding companies in the past year that compliment our business perfectly including Meguiar\u2019s in the automotive after market space, along with Polyfoam and EMFI in the adhesives and sealants area to name just a few. The integration of these businesses has gone very well and we remain convinced they will add significant value to the franchise. Given the market declines that I mentioned it was not surprising that automotive OEM related businesses were down over 40% in the local currency. The abrasives and industrial and adhesives and tapes business performed better with local currency declines in the 20\u2019s. On a more positive note sales declined at only a mid single-digit rate in our renewable energy division and in automotive after market. Last but not least our performance care business posted slightly positive local currency growth in the quarter. Looking at the business geographically, local currency sales declined 4.8% in Latin America, 19.5% in Europe, 22.5% in the United States, and 26.2% in Asia Pacific. Sales in Japan in particular were down 36% in local currency. The global ITB leadership team is aggressively managing through this recession using all the tools available as necessary. They announced restructuring actions in Q1 along with planned shutdowns, furloughs, and mandatory vacation across the operation while the global economy continues to struggle. Industrial and transportation will be well positioned for a stellar sales and profit growth once the global economy begins to rebound. Please turn to slide number nine where I will comment on the performance of our electro and communications business. This business is also working hard to overcome significant end market declines. About half of the electro communications business is linked in some fashion to the global electronics industry. So the mega declines I mentioned on the prior chart were a factor here as well. Semiconductor shipment which impacted our [carry tape] business were down 30% in the quarter. The remainder of electro and communications is largely tied to infrastructure including non-residential construction, power transmission and distribution, and telecom, all of which are projected to be down more then 20% in 2009. So our electro communications seems to have had its hands full as well in the first quarter. Sales were $480 million, down 35% year on year and profits were a positive $24 million. Sales were down 30% in local currencies with near 20% declines in telecom and electrical products and 40% plus declines in those businesses that serve the electronics industry. Local currency declines 39% in the United States, 35% in Asia Pacific, 17% in Europe, and 14% in Latin America. Now please turn to slide 10 and let\u2019s take a look at our display and graphics business. This business has seen aggressive inventory adjustments and end market contractions as a result of both the commoditization of optical films and of course the global recession. Sales were down 30% in dollars and 27% in local currency compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. Profits declined 65% to $66 million. Sales in our optical systems business declined 44% in the quarter and profits were down 75%. As we discussed on prior calls optical has transitioned from being a very high growth business to one that is much more mature. The most significant part of this transition began in the second quarter of last year therefore year on year comparisons remain quite difficult in the first quarter. These challenging year on year comparisons will begin to wane starting in Q2. The year on year decline in optical systems reduced the overall sales growth rate for D&G by 12 percentage points. On a more positive note, our optical team was successful in developing a number of new film solutions for what is commonly called Eco-TV. 3M\u2019s proprietary multi layer film solutions enable an OEM to produce a more energy efficient LCD TV by using fewer bulbs in combination with our films. We are gaining some nice traction in this area. Sales in our commercial graphics business were down 27% as customers have cut back on branding, media, and advertising plans. They too are wrestling with this challenging global recession. On the positive side, sales in traffic safety systems were about flat in local currency. This business is anticipating some boost in sales this year from the recent Washington stimulus package a portion of which is expected to be used for highway infrastructure projects. Now please turn to slide 11 where I will discuss details of our safety, security, and protection service business. Sales declined 15% in the first quarter in this business to $694 million. In local currency terms sales declined only 3.6% with acquisitions adding 10.6 points to first quarter growth. Operating income declined 34% to $129 million and margins remained at a very healthy 18.6%; a good performance considering the economic environment. Double-digit declines in most industrial end markets drove near 20% organic local currency sales declines in personal protection products which is the largest business within safety, security, and protection services. In our security systems business which is not economically cyclical, local currency growth was down just a few points. In terms of new business development, our security systems team successfully closed yet another passport supply contract during the quarter, this time to a prominent country within Europe. The 2008 divestiture of HighJump Software business negatively impacted sales growth by 2.2% in the quarter. Please turn to slide 12 where I will recap the quarter for our consumer and office business. This business turned in a stellar performance in the first quarter considering that both businesses and consumers both [inaudible] cutting back significantly on their spending. While worldwide sales contracted by 7%, this was all currency related. Sales in local currency were flat year on year which included approximately three points from acquisitions. In the fourth quarter of 2008 we acquired Futuro, a leading supplier of compression supports and hosiery which compliments our existing consumer retail healthcare business. In addition the retail portion of Aearo, a company we acquired in April of 2008, was assigned to the consumer office business in January, 2009. In the US we delivered 4.5% sales growth despite significant declines in foot traffic in most large retailers. [inaudible] this result in two ways, one the Futuro and Aearo acquisitions added four points to the US growth and two, we continue to drive penetration of new and existing products throughout our customer base, again despite negative same store sales. A great example of this is our branded Filtrete business where new products combined with innovative merchandising programs are driving strong double-digit growth. So again, despite tough end market conditions, this business did a great job in the first quarter. Now please turn to slide 13 where I will discuss the results from our most profitable segment, healthcare. This was definitely the bright spot in our portfolio in the first quarter. Local currency sales increased by two percentage points. Organically, prices offset volume declines and acquisitions added two points. Currency impacts reduced sales by almost 10 points, so total sales declined 8% to just under $1 billion. Local currency growth was led by the oral care and medical businesses along with solid performance in all international regions. Health information systems was about flat year on year. Our drug delivery systems business posted local currency sales declines in Q1 but are expected to turn positive in the second half of the year. This business does have a tendency to be a little lumpy when measured in quarters. Operating margins were an outstanding 31.2% in healthcare, a year on year increase of 1.4%. So despite the 85 sales decline profits were down just 3% in the quarter, and as in consumer and office, profits would have been flat year on year were it not for the timing change with stock options. That wraps up my discussion of the portfolio so now I will turn it back to George to who describe our 2009 outlook.\nGeorge Buckley: Thank you very much Pat, the question I think you\u2019re going to be most interested in is what about the balance of the year and I think we all know that this subject is very complex to explain but I will try to give you the best verbal description I can of how we expect the year to unfold by a couple of charts. We all know that [long] cycle businesses have far better order visibility then we do. So a view on the economies performance rather then on an order book is the key to how we see the forecast and balance of the year. In 3M\u2019s case its all happening real time. The good news is that the economic pressure will also subside here first. We are in fact a good [bell] weather of what is happening to the economy on a real time basis. Our internal economic forecast suggests mildly weaker end market conditions in Q2 then those we saw in Q1. So we still expect a little more downward momentum in the economy in Q2 though the rate of sequential decline, the second derivative shall we say, is likely to get a little bit better from here on in. That view is also supported by external econometric models. But to offset this continued end market weakening, cost reductions from recent restructuring and other actions that we\u2019ve taken will take greater hold in Q2 then they did in Q1. Additionally toward the middle or later part of the quarter I expect that some of the inventory correction transience, which have caused such steep declines in sales to everyone, will subside too, particularly in our faster inventory turning businesses such as electronics. That will probably begin in Q2 but we should see its full effect somewhere in Q3. We have a couple of pretty tough quarters behind us and likely one or possibly two more in front of us. While most of us believe the world economy will recover in due course, few have the knowledge or the confidence to predict when that recovery might be. But whether we like it or not, at this time and at some level, we\u2019re all in the forecasting business. I don\u2019t think its enough just to say, I don\u2019t know. So on that topic it is our view that the year\u2019s economy will bottom somewhere between the end of the second and the end of the third quarter. We\u2019ll probably see sequential quarter or quarter improvements after that, though not returning to the same level of economic activity that we had in 2007 until 2011. I also think Europe will lag a US recovery by a quarter or two. Some observers are a little more optimistic then me on this European topic suggesting a European recovery will run parallel to the United States, but I\u2019m not so sure. Asia, with the exception of Japan, should actually help  lead us out of the recession and in the vanguard of that movement regionally, will be China and market-wise it will be electronics and the internal Chinese economy. There is no reason to believe that automotive in the region or anywhere else for that matter will improve any time soon. That will be driven by consumer confidence which is likely to lag real improvements in the economy. Electronics markets apart, its hard to see any good news emerging in Japan\u2019s economy until well into 2010. What makes this year so difficult to predict accurately is that it\u2019s a huge year of transitions both in volume shrinkage as our end markets declined and supply chains drained, but also the reverse as pipelines refill albeit at some lower level consistent with weaker end markets. The dynamics which apply to pipeline emptying should generally also apply to pipeline filling, but I think that the filling will probably stutter at bit at first, perhaps introducing a bit of [inaudible] into the system. The restart will probably be effected by shortages of business credit and the need to building greater business confidence and then after that has happened, pipelines will probably fill fast. The key area that we have effecting the recovery is three fold; business credit availability, drawing unemployment, and candidly low aggregate demand. Stimulus packages are important on the term but I think their effect is limited short-term particularly in the United States. But to be very clear here we\u2019ve not included in our forecast any fast refill of inventory pipelines, even though it is likely to happen when the economy eventually makes the turn. What is unknown with any degree of accuracy is how much of the organic volume decline in Q1 was due to weak end market conditions and how much was due to inventory contractions in the various distribution channels what we use. If we use blended IPI data as an indicator and I\u2019ll just remind you that the worldwide IPI Q1 forecast was minus 13.6%, it would suggest that about a third of the organic volume decline at 3M was due to inventory corrections. But it is clearly difficult to know with any certainty, but as [Kean] said, we\u2019re looking for directional accuracy here, not absolute precision. I think the severity of the end market contractions and the consequent dreaded difficulty are quickly driving out excess inventory will make the channel implicitly less efficient at clearing inventory then it would have been if the sales falls were less severe. So the effect of this is that it would possibly stretch out the period where sales will be depressed due to this inventory correction factor. In terms of forecasting the two quarters [which swing] the year are the late second and the fourth quarter. The second because that is when the inventory transience I just mentioned should begin to die down in some businesses and the fourth quarter because that is when year over year comparisons turn in our favor. So in summary we expect the second quarter end markets to be similar or possibly a bit worse then Q1 in the early part of the quarter with improving results toward the end. The timing of any improvement in our wholesale sales in Q2 is much more connected to the clearing of excess inventory then it is to any material improvement in our end markets. I do not expect to see much in the way of end market improvements until at least Q3 or possibly even Q4. At 3M expect Q3 to show sequential improvements over Q2 as more channels finish drawing down inventory and some end markets also begin to improve slightly. Our modeling also shows Q4 to have marginally better end market conditions then Q3. I think all of these factors together, the year will turn out to be somewhat more challenging then we had originally expected. We believe that organic sales volumes will come in somewhere between minus 11% and minus 15% and that EPS will come in somewhere in the range of $3.90 to $4.30. I\u2019ll now give you a break to the $3.90 EPS number, please turn to slide 15. Assuming that we are at or close to dragging bottom on end market sales, and we believe that we are, the base level of earnings for this calculation would be Q1\u2019s $0.81 multiplied by four, which is $3.24. As we\u2019ve already mentioned because first quarter stock option expense is the highest of the year we realized a benefit spread out evenly over the year of $0.11 versus the Q1 run rate and that takes us to $3.35. In Q2 we expect to see take up of an early retirement program we\u2019ve just begun. We\u2019ll also do some further restructuring principally in Asia and Western Europe. In combination with previous actions, this restructuring adds another $0.20 to the year. We also expect vacation policy changes that  we\u2019ve talked to you about before to add $0.08. This gets us to a subtotal of $3.63. Moving on to the next item in the chart, even in a recessionary environment many of our businesses will still see seasonal upticks later in the year as opposed to the first quarter. Examples include consumer and office and their back to school and holiday orders, and traffic safety systems linked to the road construction season. Year-end holidays also boost consumer electronics. Considering these patterns we expect about $0.16 of additional profit versus the Q1 run rate which takes us to $3.79. Finally this low-end scenario would put us well below our original operating plan resulting in lower variable incentive compensation versus the Q1 run rate. This would add $0.11 to earnings. Adding it all up we believe that $3.90 per share is a reasonably estimate on the low end, again using Q1 as our base. Other then the seasonality issue the low end of our range assumes no improvement in sales volume for the entire year which we don\u2019t believe will be the case. Let\u2019s think about this, a year where end markets are as bad as Q1 and excess inventory takes all year to clear the channel, is highly unlikely without the influence of another as yet unknown financial or other catastrophe. So we believe that there will indeed be some additional volume increases and I\u2019ll discuss that when I walk through the high-end scenario in just a minute. To get to the high end of our range we vary only volume. Four points of additional growth which represents the difference between our high end and low end volume assumptions, would yield $0.45 of additional earnings for the year with the corresponding variable comp adjustment of $0.06 which is included in that total. And this puts the high end at $4.30 for the year. We have not included in our calculations for either end of the range is the likely benefit from better inventory absorption in the remainder of the year. In the first quarter it had a negative effect of $0.07. We think that this will be the highest such impact of any quarter in 2009 leading to a possible benefit in the range of $0.14 for the balance of the year. This should give us some cushion against the unknowns. While nobody, me included, likes to reduce forecasts this estimate reflects our best thinking about the year at this moment. It also reflects [inaudible] work by the good people at 3M in this quite unprecedented fall in the economic activity around the world and the large currency headwinds that we still face. As you can see we remain very positive in our attitudes and outlook figuring we are now about half to two thirds of the way through the knothole before the turn in the economy comes. So we figure there\u2019s no more to go through then we\u2019ve been through already and we know how to deal with it. Approaches of Darwinian economics is enfolding in the marketplace as the recession continues and we\u2019re gaining share in many places. Customers are recognizing the benefits of being with a great and reliable partner like 3M. We\u2019re also fortunate that we can invest in the future in a way that many of our competitors and peers cannot right now, and yet still make great margins. We clearly intend to become stronger on a relative basis during this tough time. We continue to be focused on cash generation as the best means of inoculating us against the downturn and R&D as the best way to prepare us for the future. The logic that we will come out of this faster then long cycle periods is compelling and we continue to see our company as a great place to invest right now and a great place to be in these times. And with that I\u2019d like to turn the call over to you for questions. Thank you very much for listening.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank\nDavid Begleiter: Your outlook is a little more cautious then others I\u2019ve spoken with in the last week and a half in terms of signs of sequential improvement over the last few weeks, first off is your April tracking better then March and what is unique about your business that would suggest you might lag some of your material peers in seeing some sequential improvement in demand.\nGeorge Buckley: I think that April is running about the same as March right now. I said in my conversation here that I think that there\u2019s obviously going to be a little bit of wash over from the first quarter into the second but toward the end of the second quarter I think that things are going to begin to turn. I also mentioned that we have seen some improvements in some of the faster turning businesses, even a little bit in industrial. We obviously don\u2019t want to get out ahead of this thing in the way that we\u2019re interpreting and we\u2019re trying to be cautious and trying to be balanced in our opinions about this but I think we\u2019re also pretty clear that the economy will make the turn by the end of the second. If the cycle is a little longer then historical experience it might take another quarter but we\u2019re pretty certain that we\u2019ll see some improvements in the second and then continuing improvements in the third. You\u2019ve just got to be careful that in the second I think what\u2019s likely to happen is some of the inventory transits are going to die down and that\u2019s probably where you\u2019re going to see the improvements so I think we\u2019ll see improvement in the numbers but not necessarily in the end markets.\nDavid Begleiter: Just lastly, on pricing versus raws, as your raws drop do you think you\u2019ll hold onto pricing and what could the impact be through the full course of the year as that gap widens.\nPat Campbell: What we\u2019re trying to do is have the best of all worlds. We\u2019ll try to hold onto price. We definitely see raw materials coming down but as we think about it on a business-by-business basis across the company we\u2019re obviously trying to manage the spread between price and raw materials. So if you notice in George\u2019s walk on our, coming off of Q1, you won\u2019t see price or materials imbedded in there in any place. The reality is we know material prices are coming down, probably in the order of magnitude of $100 million or so for the rest of the year. But for this modeling and so forth we\u2019ve not done anything from a profit improvement on that because to some degree we\u2019ll probably have to give up a little bit of price in the back half of the year.\nGeorge Buckley: I think there\u2019s kind of a race condition that\u2019s going to take place. Right now our price seems to be holding okay, we don\u2019t see the intense pressure that some people perhaps thought but I think its clear that if the economy doesn\u2019t improve, we will see that pressure and as Pat said the trick is to manage the spread between price and raw materials. But I also think there\u2019s a kind of race condition which is taking place between pressure on price and upward pressure on the economy and if the economy responds a little better then some of us might think then I think that pressure goes away and the year ends up being quite positive.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague - Citigroup\nJeff Sprague: Just a question on Asia, if you could drill a little further into that, you know interesting that it was actually the weakest geography from a local currency standpoint to what degree do you think that is the export related phenomenon into the developed world or how much of it is really kind of organic weakness in those end markets and I guess the gist of my question is you\u2019re still relatively low penetration in some of those Asian markets, what is the opportunity and the downturn to push penetration higher.\nGeorge Buckley: Well if you take Japan as probably the almost the sort of poster child for what can go wrong in Asia, their market is really concerns three things; automotive, electronics, and machine tools and they\u2019ve all been just absolutely pummeled as you well know. So I think that it answers the question implicitly you talked about  that certainly in Asia, and we map this, in Asia more of the economy is tied to export then any other region of the world obviously the United States and Europe included in that. So I think you\u2019re absolutely right, its driven by export but what\u2019s beginning to happen is some of these economies are now doing internal sort of in-country stimulus, China being perhaps the best example of that and their economy is responding so it may be that we\u2019ll see the initial betterment in the economy coming from internal stimulus packages and then obviously in turn as the rest of the world begins to pull its socks up and begin improve, we\u2019ll see that pull through into Asia. So I think it is as you rightly point out, its because of the export led nature of that particular economy. Japan is really the worst of the examples for us. China is not doing all that badly and we expect it to begin to do better and probably as I\u2019ve mentioned in my comments, I think Asia will certainly be at the front if not leader, certainly will be alongside of the United States in leading us out of recession.\nJeff Sprague: On pension, if you were to lock down on current returns and discount rates, can you give us some view of what type of headwind you look at in 2010 on pension.\nPat Campbell: Hopefully I don\u2019t lock down on where we\u2019re currently at. What we\u2019re having a tendency to model is what happens if we get back to kind of a zero return for the year and discount rates don\u2019t change. Now, the reality is discount rates have moved pretty significantly so if I took a balanced view as we\u2019re probably looking someplace in the order of about a $200 million year on year hit from 2009 to 2010 relative to our pension expense. And let\u2019s face it, that number is going to volatile. We\u2019ll see when we get to the end of the year but if I was to model today zero percent asset return and kind of a flat discount market, that would give us about a $200 million hit year on year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis \u2013 Morgan Stanley\nScott Davis: I know you buy a lot of different materials and the prices changed pretty drastically in the last more towards the end of last year and early this year, how much do you think FIFO helped you out in the quarter if at all.\nPat Campbell: I\u2019d say I don\u2019t think it helped us at all in, we still think we\u2019re probably going through about the peak of our material costs in Q1, probably a little bit averaged between Q4 and Q1 so back half maybe we got a little benefit but the slower volumes here in the first quarter really kind of hurt our ability to kind of get through that higher cost layer as fast as we would have liked to. So I would say Q1 is kind of the high level relative to cost of goods sold.\nScott Davis: I know I asked this question last quarter but I\u2019m just curious to see if its changed at all, when you think about the big picture, the supply chain fix that you have is kind of a seven year gig that you talked about but you can make an argument that this restructuring pulls forward a lot of that and helps you prepare for the next up cycle, how do you think about and is that real or am I kind of seeing that incorrectly.\nPat Campbell: I\u2019ll answer the way I will, our supply chain efforts are continuing on, it\u2019s a day-to-day exercise, so there\u2019s two sides to this. One is that as we\u2019ve cut back our CapEx spending it has somewhat probably slowed down some of our longer term moves that we were looking to make partially because we just don\u2019t have some of the demand that we needed which was going to put some of our facilities in I\u2019ll call it from a better local supply standpoint. So to some degree that has slowed some of that effort down as far as a longer-term larger CapEx investment. So some of those plans have slowed down a little bit. But the I\u2019ll call it the untangling of a lot of the hairball that George talked to a lot of you about, is that\u2019s a day to day effort, plant by plant, that\u2019s product by product, its process by process and all that stuff continues to go on but to be fair, there are some pieces that had to do with some longer term bigger moves that we had in mind that we have put on the back burner here for at least the near-term.\nGeorge Buckley: So what it will do is basically, it will push that supply chain initiatives essentially to the right for a year and just to underscore Pat\u2019s point, there were really three elements. One was the building of local plants close to markets, which was the stuff that was visible in that 17, 18, 19 plant builds. There was a second element of this again which was about capacity adding which was the building of super hubs that really looked to the future about where the demand might be and trying to locate the set of plants which multiple businesses in them that could respond regionally. Then the third one which Pat mentioned was this internal hairball back in the United States where we had multiple plant shunts and that didn\u2019t include or didn\u2019t need either the opening or closing of plants. That\u2019s ongoing, we\u2019re doing that and that will bring its benefits, so you are right in the sense that that\u2019s still ongoing and will deliver benefits later on in working capital improvements and overall efficiency and fill rates I think. But to be fair the other elements of it will get slid to the right.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker - Bernstein\nSteven Winoker: First question I have is on operating leverage as I think about the cost reductions going on, the operating leverage in the first quarter was 1.9x on my math which implies on the low end of the guidance or the range of the guidance about 0.5 to 0.8 for the rest of the year so a significant improvement and you\u2019ve talked about a bunch of the cost reduction actions, but could you maybe give a little bit more color for sort of what really has to go right to hit that kind of betterment on the operating leverage side.\nPat Campbell: First of all the models don\u2019t always work the same going down as they do on the upside. You\u2019ve got a fair amount of fixed costs, business and so forth and when you\u2019ve got, especially a relatively large manufacturing organization even though you try your [darndest] to try and take all the inventory out of the system and run lean and so forth, there is a certain element of inefficiency that you have in your manufacturing processes when volumes contract as rapidly as they have. You just can\u2019t completely right size all of your manufacturing and your supply chains over night so there\u2019s an element of inefficiency that does happen on the downside especially in a very dramatic decline scenario. On the upside the way I would think of it is we\u2019ve laid out a number of restructuring actions that we\u2019re talking about. What\u2019s critical to us though is we\u2019ve got to hold the line on our staffing levels and our spending when volume comes back. And so we\u2019ve got very stringent controls in place to make sure that both our spending and staffing levels hold at current levels until its very, very clear that there truly is a long-term volume uptick here to make sure you don\u2019t get a bunch of false positives and you start to respond prematurely. So we have to execute the restructuring. We have to continue to focus on gaining share where we can and get some additional business but importantly we have to get the leverage here on the upside. What we tell the businesses is we spend money to restructure your business, we can\u2019t be putting these people back in when the volume returns so we\u2019ve got to become a leaner organization as volume comes back.\nSteven Winoker: Does that imply a certain amount of capacity reduction across the business that you could sort of quantify order of magnitude.\nPat Campbell: No I wouldn\u2019t say, its very, not on a large scale I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re taking a lot of plants out. We will be altering some of our more developed market supply chains. Back to Scott\u2019s question a little bit which is just kind of our normal piece of business. Its fair to say we have a fair amount at this level, we have a fair amount of excess capacity but when you look at, we don\u2019t see this as being a permanent volume level. Its very clear that maybe it doesn\u2019t bounce back in the next six months, but as George outlined probably by 2011 or so we\u2019re back to 2007 levels so we\u2019re not going to rip up our capacity and our structure in response to the current conditions. But in the meantime we\u2019ve got to do some extraordinary efforts here to make sure that we bring down the cost and are really able to maintain our capability on a long-term basis. One of the things that we\u2019re looking to do is to bring in a bunch of business from the outside in to some of our plants to fully utilize it and so forth. So we have a number of those actions going on.\nSteven Winoker: On your five year product vitality index which was about I guess 25% or so in 2008 and thought it would be more then 30% this year, is that still the number that you\u2019re targeting or what number are you looking for this year.\nGeorge Buckley: Fred just gave us a report just the other day and its gone up by another couple of points. Whether by the end of the year it makes it to 30 is yet to be determined. Obviously you\u2019ve got overall sales falls, both new product and replacement products. But I think we will continue to take meaningful and helpful steps down that pathway. So I think overall the news is, will be positive even if its not exactly that number that you just mentioned.\nPat Campbell: One of the bright lights here is that if you go back and track that metric for a period of time, so much of that new product vitality metric used to be optical, now its made up of broad based business growth across all the divisions of the company so it\u2019s a lot solider development program that we\u2019ve got going on now.\nGeorge Buckley: That number back in the optical heyday, in the 2004 2005 timeframe was down, for the core of 3M was down in single-digits. So what it tells you is the underlying health that the core of the business and the innovation in the core of business is very, very strong, very, very much alive and well and its not going to take very many years, maybe only another couple to really get this back to the point where we, its going to be the engine in a sense that drives that underlying 5% to 8% organic growth that we are looking for, all these economic downturns notwithstanding.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty \u2013 Credit Suisse\nJohn McNulty: With regard to working capital, you certainly made some headway but clearly not probably as much as you wanted to given that you still got some inventories that you need to work down and there\u2019s some high cost inventory in there as well, can you give us some color as to where you think or what you think you can squeeze out of working capital throughout the rest of the year to help drive the cash flow.\nPat Campbell: Let me try to deal with inventory kind of an isolation here for a second, we probably need to make about the same level of improvement. If you wash out FX and acquisitions we had about $250 million for the period here. We probably need to make another similar improvement over the rest of the year would be the level of improvement. The thing on receivables, receivables is so sales volume dependent. We will maintain our days outstanding in a relatively tight position but it will vary depending upon what volume scenario you\u2019re looking at.\nJohn McNulty: With regard to cash flow, your balance sheet is in pretty solid shape at this point. There are a lot of companies out there that are struggling, any reason to think that maybe stepping up into the M&A markets a little more aggressively would make sense for you at this point.\nPat Campbell: Well you have to keep an eye on what the marketplace is and of course we\u2019re trying to balance the combination of our liquidity, our credit position in the market as well. So we\u2019ll take a look at all those. For the right kind of deal, the right kind of value, we will continue to entertain those for the long-term health of the company.\nGeorge Buckley: I think in the rare places where we\u2019ve touched this, we\u2019re not finding companies who are perhaps as realistic on prices, many people from the outside looking in might think. So in some ironic way if this continues for a little bit longer I think that situation is going to change. Some of those people are going to be perhaps more incentivized to listen more sensibly. So I think the longer it goes on the more likely that kind of issue, we\u2019re just going to have to see, as Pat said, we\u2019ll take in on a case by case basis.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Inch \u2013 Merrill Lynch\nJohn Inch: So I think you mentioned that flat panel TVs were looking better, my question is I know that if you go back in time we had sort of talked, we as in you, had sort of talked about being designed out of a lot of this stuff, is flat panel TV going forward still significant and maybe you could dovetail that with a little bit of this eco-friendly product that you\u2019ve got. How significant could flat panels be for you in an up cycle if volumes for televisions improve.\nGeorge Buckley: Its an amazing thing, its like tidal ebbs and flows in this business. You know that so much of this design in and design out is real time and these guys in the end markets, Samsung and LG and Sony, they\u2019re in really, really tough markets. And so they use innovation, they use latest mega trends, means of driving their volume. And one of the obviously mega trends has been, and its really right across the industry, its in the battery powered devices it\u2019s a drive toward extended battery life. In the electrically powered devices it\u2019s a drive toward lower energy costs and the beauty of the kind of films that 3M has and films which are protected by intellectual property, I\u2019m thinking in particular the multi layer film DBEF, are the ones that give you this facility. So what\u2019s actually happening now, a lot of the panel manufacturers are able to get from four down to two lamps, or eight lamps down to five, and get 30, 40 or even a little more out of the, energy out of the panel. And when you realize that they\u2019re saving on lamps and they\u2019re saving on inverters and they\u2019re putting in films its actually more or less a net trade. And so the end customer assuming that the panel manufacturers can find it in their way to pass this through to the set manufacturers and then to the retail customers you can have today a set consuming roughly 40% less of the energy for the same price as you could for ones which [inaudible] is not. And so that seems to be gathering a lot of momentum and it really is taking hold in the marketplace. So I think that in terms of just square footage of film manufacturing its probably got a pretty good upside. But all of those are being burned by the commoditization of this particular market so I\u2019m not going to get out ahead of myself. But I do think that significant increases in volume of course muted by price and effected by what kind of film it is on margin wise, but nevertheless I think this has the possibility in a perverse and ironic twist of history of giving us a little bit of upside in the display and graphics market. So all those conversations that you and I have had about this market which is very challenging may get better in the coming months. The trick still is to make sure all of the high margin business, the better performing businesses like handhelds don\u2019t see some similar switches in technology to what TV did. Its not happening yet, but its something that we are, having once been burned we are very aware of. So I think the overall the news is more positive then it once was.\nPat Campbell: And I think, I just want to make sure that you don\u2019t misread anything we say. Its not going to go back to where it was, but definitely is a sequentially better then the performance in the TV section during the past year.\nGeorge Buckley: If I [keep] it in this quarter even though we report year over year numbers, if you look sequentially fourth quarter to first quarter very significant improvements in profit in that business and in margin in that business so certainly the trend has turned.\nJohn Inch: I know you had shuttered capacity in optical film given what you\u2019re describing are you now, would you characterize your situation as being right sized to be able to benefit from this trend or would you foresee even possibly adding a little bit of capacity down the road.\nGeorge Buckley: No I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any capacity needed. Where we shuttered some capacity has been in the converters, the guys really out in Asia for the most part. The manufacturing capacity here has not been shuttered. There is some manufacturing capacity being repurposed for window films which are obviously being driven by the interest in ecology and interest in energy consumption. So no, I think we\u2019re okay right now and as much of this we can get, Pat and I will be dancing in the streets.\nJohn Inch: And do you have a sense of what your global capacity utilization might be with respect to current volumes, I\u2019m trying to think of the little bit of the opportunity to reabsorb some fixed cost as volumes at some point come back and sort of trying to bridge a little bit of the upside/downside scenario you\u2019ve presented in the 2009.\nPat Campbell: To be perfectly honest we don\u2019t, our businesses are so different, our processes are so different from a capacity perspective, giving you a number is kind of interesting and my guess is probably in the 70\u2019s range is kind of where as I think about it. But you\u2019ve got extreme examples, you\u2019ve got businesses and consumer today that are running very, very well. Healthcare running very, very well. Industrial and electro communications of course, we\u2019ve got some plants that are running a third. So you\u2019ve got sizable spreads across the portfolio.\nGeorge Buckley: In renewable energy we can\u2019t keep up with the demand. In [inaudible]] tapes it\u2019s the same issue. Really very, very rapid growth yet you\u2019ve got other things that are automotive related that are the opposite end. So I think it really is, Pat\u2019s absolutely right, hard to give you a blended number but its probably within a couple of points of 70%.\nJohn Inch: Could you remind us what your exposure is roughly to commercial construction, I\u2019m just trying to think of, you\u2019re clearly a short cycle company, I\u2019m just trying to think are there some temperaments that might, we should maybe be cognizant of just as those end markets\u2014\nPat Campbell: I wouldn\u2019t even worry, its not a significant piece, it would be at best a couple of points. I\u2019d probably have to round up to get there.\nGeorge Buckley: And its mostly residential and we began to see that misery going back really to the end of 2006 so we\u2019ve lived through most of the construction misery that\u2019s likely to be thrown at us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan\nStephen Tusa: I have a question, when you first came in it was a little bit bumpy with regards to the visibility on the D&G issue and obviously we\u2019ve had a tough economy for the last six to nine months and nobody has been very good at predicting things, what gives you the confidence now to use the term bottom and are you comfortable that you\u2019ve been around here long enough now and you\u2019ve been ingrained in the culture and are comfortable with your systems enough so that you think you have the visibility to make that kind of comment, if you could just comment on that it would be great.\nGeorge Buckley: I\u2019d sort of alluded to this a little bit earlier in the conference call when I said we can\u2019t take a view on what\u2019s happening from an order book because our order books are typically 30 days out and there isn\u2019t going to be a change materially anyway in 30 days out. So we have to build other kind of models about how we believe the economy will respond. Our observations are based on those models. We\u2019ve looked at historical models, by analyzing the recessions going right over the last 100 years in the United States, looking at the length of the cycles, how much of the time they spend in recession, how deep they are, looking at the last cycles, looking at the longest cycles, the shortest cycles, and we\u2019ve built a model that leads us to the conclusion that I iterated that a bottom somewhere the, this is end markets not necessarily wholesale markets, because obviously if you see a transient in the end market rippled back through the supply chain, and is often magnified. That\u2019s what you see IPI in the first quarter at 13 but you see say our sales and ITW sales and other company sales down in the 20\u2019s because the channel is clearing the inventory out and what is so key to making an assessment on the year is how fast that inventory might clear out so you can actually, and the perverse nature of this is you can have those inventory transients die down where wholesale and retail shall we call it that, for want of a better description, are in states as sort of a match, but yet you still, you seen an improvement from down 21 to down 13. Its still miserable but at least its an improvement. So we are not expecting any significant improvements in the end markets but we have to take a view on how the economy is doing. We have to take a view on how efficient the channel is, clearing out inventory in rolling up these kind of forecasts as to what generally happens in the economy. But oddly enough if you take the way that I rolled up the numbers and the way Pat rolled up the numbers, you take that first quarter performance and you add a little bit of stock option back in, you add a little bit of Venezuela back in, and even a little bit of the inventory correction stuff back in, and then systematically things that we know we can control, the vacation, the restructuring which is going to come to us, makes the assumption that we hold the costs constant and a few other bits and pieces. And it looks to us like we can get to the, it looks like we can get to the $3.90 even if the economy doesn\u2019t improve all year. So and we just can\u2019t bring ourselves from all that we know from the green shoots that we know, from the performance of the channels in electronics for example that we know, we can\u2019t get ourselves to the point where we think that anything significantly worse then that $3.90 we\u2019ve come in. So its just a lot harder, and you know this business very well, its just harder to make an assessment in a company like this because we don\u2019t have an order book so you\u2019ve got to make those assessments of the channel and you\u2019ve got to make those assessments of the market and they\u2019re the ones that we\u2019ve made.\nStephen Tusa: One more big picture question, you touch the consumer in a lot of areas and you\u2019ve got a great R&D budget and spend a lot on marketing and I\u2019m sure you study this every day, from the feedback from your guys, is there any risk that there is a kind of structural change here in the consumer behavior that\u2019s not as temporary as some might think. Its kind of a structural trade down, there\u2019s risk that 3M will not get paid for the kind of innovation that they have gotten paid for historically, is there any concern around that kind of dynamic as we go into this less leveraged world where people just feel a little less rich.\nGeorge Buckley: Its an interesting question, it really is. I think you can answer this at two or three levels. I\u2019m an import to this country but I do observe about my wonderful adopted countrymen that old habits die hard. And so the consumer, at the consumer level, I think that kind of behavior pattern probably won\u2019t last. It doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be a little bit of lag but I don\u2019t think it will last. Now in the industrial spaces, I think the question is a little tougher. Certainly what we\u2019ve really kind of found is a combination of things. Some people moving down the market, we classically describe the market as good, better, best. But what we\u2019ve actually, we kind of draw it as a pyramid with a smaller top and a wider bottom, but what\u2019s actually happened, [Moe] made a great point about this. What he\u2019s seeing is the pyramid changing to an hourglass, where the middle is shrinking and people are either moving up to better products, more reliable suppliers, people they can turn to in tough times and to some degree those who are in trouble moving down markets and expanding the bottom of the markets. But what we\u2019ve done and its really happened, I think you were there, the first time that I ever presented to this group in this company we talked about how we can capture some of the bottom of the market not only for growth opportunities but as a [bulwark] against the encroachment of foreign competition, low cost competition. So I actually think oddly enough we\u2019ve positioned ourselves extremely well and you\u2019ll see new products coming out in, I probably shouldn\u2019t tell you the marketplace, in a number of different segments where we\u2019ve responded to that already the products are available, ready to launch and I think we\u2019re going to be well, well placed to capture this growth in this marketplace wherever it happens even if there is the kind of secular change that\u2019 you\u2019re implying in your question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Barclays Capital\nShannon O'Callaghan: On the inventory reduction comment, you mentioned the gross margin impact, when you think about that along the segments, can you quantify which segments got hit the hardest by that.\nPat Campbell: As I think you\u2019d probably expect, it\u2019s the ones that have the steepest volume declines so I think it\u2019s a direct correlation. That\u2019s not to say that we\u2019re not driving improvements in consumer and healthcare but there\u2019s just much more of a need right now in those businesses who\u2019ve seen the biggest volume reductions to adjust their output plans.\nShannon O'Callaghan: For industrial and transportation, electro, do you have any size of what you think that hurt you by.\nPat Campbell: I would say, if at the company level we said we were about a point and a half, you could probably take those businesses and say they\u2019re probably two points plus. That\u2019s kind of a back of the seat answer.\nShannon O'Callaghan: What about on the flip side then, you had kind of the blow out margins in healthcare and consumer and office were held impressively well too, was there anything you discount there in terms of mix or something and going forward.\nPat Campbell: No, I think its fair to say that with our industrial related businesses, electronics hurting as bad we did have to probably choke off some spending in healthcare and consumer for the good of the company, not long, long-term but at least from a timing standpoint. Part of the reason consumer margins improved was just some timing of some of our merchandising programs and so forth. And we\u2019ll have to manage those as the year goes on. As well, the great thing about having the portfolio of businesses you\u2019ve got is you got a third of our portfolio is really doing reasonably well, in this environment, really trying to help out the other piece of it.\nGeorge Buckley: I think long-term, clearly this healthcare business is just a great place to invest. It just is a great place to invest for all sorts of different reasons, growth rates, absence of volatility, and just the overall quality of margins. Our sort of long-term view in the healthcare business is margins. They\u2019re in the late 20\u2019s but obviously those kind of margins are going to be with much higher growth rates and there\u2019ll be some transitioning. Its possible that these margins would ease a little bit as growth picks up as we invest more in R&D and we push the product a little harder. But this is just fundamentally just a great segment with great possibility, great growth, great margins, and we are just so glad to have it.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of John Roberts \u2013 Buckingham Research\nJohn Roberts: Some people are looking at China as kind of the leading indicator of the economic cycle, and I think there have already been reports of at least domestic consumption turning up for the last couple of months in China, it sounded like you were still waiting to see, you expect it, but it sounded like you hadn\u2019t seen it yet.\nGeorge Buckley: No, its begun to happen. I think that the fourth quarter was I think something of a shock to a lot of people in the way that volume fell off but no, we are seeing that, that\u2019s the kind of reports we\u2019re getting out of our Chinese folks that they\u2019re seeing that domestic volume picking up and of course obviously what they hope is the balance of the year and the balance of the world responds, that they\u2019ll see that going back to the old ways of export-led. So I think that it seems that that Chinese stimulus package is beginning to get traction and working reasonably well.\nJohn Roberts: Is it your consumer materials, your consumer related stuff or is it your infrastructure products that you would have in China.\nGeorge Buckley: Its mostly every, that business that we have over there is the kind of China for China, its not the China for export necessarily, at least its not how we set it up. So I think when those internal economy markets improve, we\u2019re just going to ride this along with, on a kind of general GDP-like improvement in the China economy.\nOperator: There are no additional questions at this time; I would like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing comments.\nGeorge Buckley: Well thank you very much everybody for listening. Hopefully we answered your questions well and we look forward to talking to you next time."}], "2011": [{"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 4, "year": 2010, "date": "2011-01-25 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nMatt Ginter: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Fourth Quarter Business Review. It was good to see many of you at our Annual Outlook Meeting last month in New York City. On the morning of March 17, we are hosting another meeting, this time at our headquarters in St. Paul. We may tweak the agenda a bit between now and then, but you can expect to hear from several emerging 3M leaders that run big and important divisions, such as Food Safety, Renewable Energy, Industrial Tapes and Adhesives, Electronic Markets, Orthodontics, Automotive OEM and Personal Protection, along with the leaders of our operations in China, India and Brazil. The senior leadership team will be there as well, including George, Pat and the heads of our six businesses and international operations, and it promises to be a great day. I make no promises, but will do my best to keep away the snow and frigid cold. If you're on our e-mail distribution list, you will receive an invitation later this week. So please join us, and RSVP as soon as you can. For those not on our list but wish to go, just drop a note or call, and we'll be glad to take care of you. If you would take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 2 in today's slide deck. During today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. So let's begin today's review, and I'll turn the program over to George Buckley. Please turn to Slide #3.\nGeorge Buckley: Thank you very much, Matt, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today, and a belated Happy New Year to all of you. Today, my remarks will focus mainly on the year and the future, and Pat will go over most of the details of the quarter. Five years ago, we set out to move 3M gradually but permanently to a higher growth regimen. We knew it would require a step change in our attitude towards growth and especially in our attitude to investments in growth. That challenge was made a lot tougher by our concurrent goal of maintaining superior margins and returns that you've come to expect from 3M. Looking at 2010 as a milestone toward these goals, it was a very good year. Organic volumes rose 13.7% in the year versus estimated worldwide IPI growth of 8%, and we posted record sales of $26.7 billion, an increase of 15.3%. We achieved record operating profit of $5.9 billion, putting aside historical onetime items, with margins of 22.2%, which are up 140 basis points year-over-year. And we've posted another all-time annual record with earnings per share of $5.75, an increase of 25% year-on-year. Free cash flow was $4.1 billion, with a conversion rate of 100%. It was not a long time ago when growth at 3M was limited to a handful of divisions. Last year, four of our six business segments turned in double-digit sales growth. And every single one of our businesses were up year-on-year. Sales exceeded 2008 levels by $1.4 billion, meaning the 2009 recession is well and truly behind us, if not perhaps for all Western economies as a whole. Exceeding [ph] IPI by 570 basis points mean we took over a half of point of share organically across the company in 2010, and we've accomplished this in a time of tremendous challenge. So all in all, we're very pleased with 3M's progress on the growth front. And that share gain means we took further step down the road of building even more enduring franchises. In fact, we've not recorded double-digit currency growth for decades, so we're very encouraged by the 14% local currency growth we drove last year, and especially so in light of the uncertain economic conditions under which we're all operating. It's still probably premature to hang up the mission-accomplished banner just yet. But I think, it's certainly fair to say that our growth plan is progressing very nicely. At the same time, we know that growth of a company like ours is not achieved easily or always smoothly. There are always countless dials to turn and multiple leaders to push to keep things moving on the right trajectory and in proper balance. You also get the occasional asteroid hit just to keep things exciting. On the journey to higher growth, we've learned a few things about what we're good at and about what we need to improve. There is no longer any doubt in our minds that, as a company, we understand the calculus of higher growth. We understand how to get it and what to do to accelerate it. And we certainly revived our new product development and innovation processes as part of that. That's working extremely well, and ultimately, without that, none of the other aspirations we have for accelerating shareholder value creation will work. We've also shown that we know how to secure high growth overseas, driven by building new labs and localizing our technology and leadership there to drive growth. Given the moribund state of interest in science in the United States, this is strategically very important to our future security. We've also shown that we can drive our tax rate and bring more cash back to the company. Up to about five years ago, for years, our tax rate had bounced around the 34% rate. We've successfully driven that down. And for now, the sustainable rate already seems to be somewhere in the 29% range, but with increasing downward pressure as we grow overseas and build more manufacturing locally. We'll see it pop up a bit this year, but only because we were so hugely successful in our technical tax planning last year that won't repeat. So these things have all been very successful. We've also shown that we can manage a number of boil-the-ocean programs at once, for example, revitalizing innovation, making major changes to our manufacturing footprint, localizing labs and science et cetera, in preparation for a world where the West is no longer the dominant manufacturing power. Perhaps the most important of these projects is the rekindling of the innovative spirit at our company. 3M scientists and innovators remain our single-most important competitive advantage everywhere in the world. And when properly managed and motivated, they create technology and product platforms unequaled anywhere. We've worked very hard to energize and unleash the power of 3M scientists, primarily by getting them back in the business of inventing new products. Their efforts have driven our new product NPVI up to 34.4% compared with numbers that were languishing in the teens just a few years ago. It brings me great pride to say that 3M is probably the last of the U.S.'s and probably the world's great broad science-based companies. This is the real basis of our sustainable competitive advantage, using science from a vast array of patents and capabilities. Mix that in with the vision, energy and optimism and our magnificent global footprint, and it becomes an almost unbeatable combination, we think. There are still many great engineering and manufacturing companies around and even a few excellent chemical companies. But there's really nothing anywhere quite like 3M. I don't know if we ever should or will ever get proper recognition for this, but it's ultimately what we're all about. But we're not satisfied that it's all rosy. We've still got a lot of work to do reducing our working capital usage, for example. You can see the challenge buried in the mechanics and the arithmetic of the problem, as we grow rapidly overseas, yet still with a lot of our manufacturing in the United States and therefore with long supply chains, the challenge of better turns won't be fully addressed until we've secured a regional source of supply percentage within sighting distance of 100%. For us, that's a target normally greater than 80%.  Of course, this task is made all the harder by the poor visibility of orders in our sales make-up. We sell mostly consumables, not finished goods. And the nature of that particular beast is short order visibility. Please don't confuse this with early cycle, mid-cycle or late cycle. We sell into all of those markets. So these factors combine to keep us more in a make-to-stock more than we clearly would like to be, in a more made-to-order. We're building factories overseas pretty much as fast as we can, but our sales growth rates there almost outstrip the newly added capacity as soon as we install it. So we're still making slow progress against that 80% regional source of supply goal. At some level, this is great news, but it does make progress against our working capital targets much harder. Lots more to be done and had here. We also have a few businesses that have large price-down profiles as the nature of that particular beast. Our Optical business is the most visible of these, not to use a pun. So net-net, it's often hard for us to post positive annual net price. The pricing volatility in that market should calm down once maturity is reached in the end market, maybe three or so years out from now. But for now, it's a challenge. But that can cover up a weakness in another area, where I think we are sometimes slow to react, and that's in price recovery. This quarter, we saw the effects of optical pricing, commodity price increases, along with start-up costs in new factories plus in purchase accounting, all washing into our gross margin line. Pat will give you details on that in a few minutes. The great margins we made in H1N1-related product last year also were part of this mix down in Q4. The pricing actions have all been taken now, but I think it's fair to say that we were late to the game, but were on it. This year, we plan to beef up our international manufacturing leadership in those countries that have been receiving lots of new manufacturing assets and we'll be intensely focused on factory costs. It's going to be in China, in Singapore, in Poland, in Brazil and a few others. Nothing drastic, but these are important strategic steps. This is the close-to-market manufacturing model we spoke about many times previously. And it parallels what we've done in technical and business leadership, going ever more local. We've also increased our investment spending in R&D and new business ventures significantly in 2010, simply because the time was right and we could afford it. In the coming year, though, we expect to see a growing payoff on a lot of these investments. Last year, we provided sea [ph] money for quite a few -- a number of business ventures to get them off the ground. Next year, most will become self-funding. The successful ventures will survive on their own merit, and others won't. Unless the economy rockets ahead this year, we don't intend to advance this spending beyond where we are today, in fact, not even to repeat some of it. We successfully closed three sizable deals in Q4, Cogent, Attenti and Arizant, and hope to make similar progress on Alpha Beta in Taiwan and Winterthur in Switzerland in the first quarter. Finally, as is our practice, we'll spend cautiously in the early part of this year to see where things go. We know that we're facing a number of sizable non-operational headwinds, such as pension and tax rate, and tougher optical pricing, so we'll move forward very prudently. Before I pass the call over to Pat, let me reflect on one last latent realization in our growth model. Over the last hundred years, we've learned how to compete with our big global competitors, great iconic companies that are household names, and by the way, to win many of these battles. For the future, that is most dangerous -- the competition that is most dangerous is local competition, whether that's in Brazil, in China, India or Indonesia. To win the battle against them, you have to be like them. You have to develop locally, manufacture locally, hire locally, purchase locally and lead locally. Unless there are insurmountable issues of scale involved, you have to go local. With that, I'll now pass the call over to Pat for more details on the year and the quarter.\nPatrick Campbell: Thanks, George, and good morning. Let us look at our full year P&L, so please turn to Slide #4. Sales for the full year rose 15%, driven almost entirely by organic volume improvement. We grew organically about 1.7x the rate of industrial production, so it is evident that we gained significant share in the year. It was encouraging to see how many of our businesses grew their top line in 2010. Sales rose in every region of the world, with Asia-Pacific up 35%, Latin America up 18%, Canada up 16%, United States up 8% and Europe up 5%. Similarly, all six of our business segments expanded sales during the year, led by Electro Communications at 28%, Display and Graphics at 24%, Industrial and Transportation at 19% and Consumer and Office at 11%. Even if we dig one level deeper at the subsegment or the divisional level, 2010 sales rose across the board. A number of factors are contributing to the growth. George mentioned that our New Product Vitality Index was 31% in 2010, up two full points year-on-year. Investments in innovation, sales and marketing capability and localized manufacturing are creating new growth opportunities in adjacent spaces, and our new product launches are getting better and better. As CFO, I look for that -- how does innovation translate to the financial results as sustainable, profitable growth. Our performance in 2010 certainly suggests that it's working very well. Gross margins rose by 0.5% during the year, half a point as ongoing Lean Six Sigma and other productivity efforts delivered the needed factory savings to offset a 2% increase in raw materials. Sales and marketing investments increased in line with sales, including a 20%-plus increase in advertising and merchandising to develop our brands and drive higher growth. And R&D investment rose at a double-digit clip, albeit slightly less than the rate of sales growth. Operating income rose 23% year-on-year, and margins rose 1.4 percentage points to 22.2%, right in line with our long-term objective. Note that all business segments posted operating margins north of 20% for the year. For the full year, tax rate was down over two points to 27.7%, even after absorbing a point and a half penalty for Medicare Part D. The reduction was primarily a function of some targeted reorganizations of certain parts of our international operations, improved statutory rates in several countries and benefits from the resolution of several tax audits during the course of the year. Bottom line earnings were $5.63 per share, up 25% versus 2009. Excluding special items, earnings were $5.75 per share, up 23%. On top of a strong sales and earnings performance, we generated record levels of economic profit in 2010, putting aside the 2006 and 2007 gains from the sale of our Pharma business. And ROIC was nearly 21% for the year. All in all, it was a very good year and positions us very well going into 2011. If you turn us to Slide 5, you will see a progression of our expectations for sales, margin, tax rate and earnings during 2010. And clearly, this chart today to shed some light on the way in which we have been managing the trade-offs between accelerating top line growth and margins. We obviously report numbers every quarter, but we manage the business for long-term success. Even as early as the first quarter, it became apparent that we could accelerate top line growth. So we proactively accelerated investments in a number of projects to drive future sales growth. As the year progressed further, we gained added confidence with the leverage on our higher top line growth, coupled with a lower tax rate for 2010, so we could afford another round of discretionary investments. Some of these investments were lab-oriented. Others were more focused on increasing sales coverage and marketing strength, such as our accelerated investment plan for China. Still others were not out-of-pocket investments per se, but sales-related that afforded us the flexibility to more aggressively penetrate certain markets, such as b- and c-tier strategies. Many investments have already paid off in new business in 2010, but still others are slated pay back in 2011. So naturally, we'll be holding back on new investments early in 2011 to help offset headwinds such as pension expense and a higher tax rate. At this point, it does not appear that we will have the same level of flexibility in 2011. But as the case every year, we'll see how things play out. To summarize, as growth accelerated in 2010, and we can see our tax rate improving, we intensified investments in the business. In the end, we still managed to expand earnings, and importantly, the company is much better positioned going forward as a result. Please turn to Slide 6 for a review of the fourth quarter. In dollar terms, sales in the fourth quarter rose nearly 10%, which included an 8.6% increase in organic volumes. Adjusting for last year's sales boost from H1N1, organic volumes would have been greater than 10% or 1.7x estimated worldwide industrial production. Sales rose 22% in Asia-Pacific against a pretty tough comp in last year's fourth quarter. Inside the APAC numbers, it was encouraging to see a 30%-plus growth in Electro Communications, driven by new product platforms, shift gains, and good underlying strength in the consumer electronics markets. Equally exciting was a 30% growth in our APAC Consumer and Office business. Elsewhere around the globe, sales rose 12% in Latin America; 6% in the U.S. and 2% in Europe, although the weaker euro was a drag on sales in the region. Excluding currency effects, sales in Europe increased by 8%. Acquisitions added 1.8% to sales in the quarter, and selling prices declined by 30 basis points year-on-year. Gross margins were down just over a point year-on-year, largely due to higher raw materials and negative mix. Raw material inflation was approximately 3% year-on-year, which constituted the bulk of the variance. Action plans are underway, and we fully expect to offset raw material costs in 2011 with selling prices of our own. During the quarter, given the combination of strong sales growth and a lower tax rate, driven primarily by lower international rates and some favorable U.S. federal and state initiatives, we opted to invest additional funds in the fourth quarter. Total R&D and SG&A spending as a percent of sales was up 1.3 percentage points. We [indiscernible] about $90 million of additional spending in the quarter, which will help us get a jumpstart on 2011 growth. Please turn to Slide #7 for some quick commentary on our fourth quarter segment results. In our largest business, Industrial and Transportation, sales rose nicely at plus 10%, with every division posting higher year-on-year growth. Notable performances were Renewable Energy, up 78%; Aerospace and Aircraft Maintenance up 26%; Abrasives and Advanced Materials both up around 15%; and our Automotive OEM business up 14%. Margins in Industrial and Transportation were down about a point year-on-year, largely due to accelerated R&D and SG&A funding on new growth programs. Incremental investment levels will moderate in 2011 as these programs become part of the base business and begin to fund themselves. Higher raw material costs also impacted margins, which will trigger price increases in many parts of the business. Moving to Health Care. Sales rose 4% in the quarter to $1.2 billion. H1N1 was a big boost to the business in the fourth quarter last year, which lowered year-on-year growth rates by 2%. On the positive side, our recent acquisition of Arizant, the leading provider of surgical patient warming solutions, added four points to growth this quarter. Margins were 29% in Health Care compared to peak margins of 32.7% in last year's fourth quarter, which is in line with our longer-term expectations of the high 20s. A number of factors drove the year-on-year change, including incremental 2010 investment programs in drug delivery systems and digital oral care. H1N1 mix had impacts from the acquisition I just mentioned and some rationalization of two U.S.-based facilities in the fourth quarter of 2010. In Display and Graphics, sales increased 10% year-on-year up to $903 million. Sales rose at a double-digit clip in Commercial Graphics, so things are definitely picking up there. Sales in opticals, films increased at a low-teens rates despite the near-term challenges in LCD TV that we articulated in October and more recently in New York in December. We continue to find new applications to grow volumes across the various device segments, including LCD TVs, notebooks and handheld devices. Finally, our Traffic Safety Systems business drove low single-digit growth in the quarter. Despite the higher volumes, margins in Display and Graphics declined 1.4 points year-on-year, largely related to Optical. In the fourth quarter, we reduced optical inventories to respond to inventory imbalances throughout the channel and to make sure that we did not enter 2010 with excess inventory. Consequently, we undertook extensive manufacturing downtime in Q4 to adjust the inventories as well as to test some new materials. Optical, by its nature, has very high incremental leverage, so margin swings are not unusual around production volume changes. Consumer and Office had an outstanding quarter, with sales up 8% and operating income up 10%. Growth continued to run strong in the mass retail and DIY channels. But the nice surprise in the fourth quarter was the office channel. Office has been a tough space on and off for the past couple of years, so our 15% top line growth in the fourth quarter was a welcome change in trajectory. We've been investing aggressively in Asia Pacific to strengthen our presence in the retail channel, so it was encouraging that we posted a 33% fourth quarter sales increase in this business. The growth is coming both organically, boosted by accelerated sales and marketing investments that began in the first quarter, and via acquisition, largely due to the April 2010 acquisition of A-One. A-One is the largest office label supplier in Asia and is performing superbly in the first year as part of the 3M family. In Safety, Security and Protection Services, sales were $847 million, up 7% year-on-year or up 19.4% when you exclude the comps from H1N1. A full 15 points of this growth was organic volume improvement, spread across all businesses, with particular strength in Security Systems. Acquisitions, namely Cogent and Attenti, added about four points to growth in the quarter. Safety and Security margins were nearly 20%, down 4.8% year-on-year due to two primary factors. First and most significantly, we experienced negative mix associated with lower year-on-year H1N1-related sales. Recall that our respiratory factories were running all-out in late 2009 in order to meet surging demand at that time. Second, 2010 margins were impacted by acquisition expenses related to Cogent and Attenti. In Electro Communications, sales and profits increased 21% and 32% respectively. The story here is similar to recent quarters, in that our businesses that serve the consumer electronics market continued to grow rapidly. We also posted double-digit sales growth in the Electrical Products business. A new piece of good news was that in our Telecom business, which posted high single-digit growth in the fourth quarter after several tough quarters. Margins were a solid 20.6% in the fourth quarter. Finally, in corporate and miscellaneous, fourth quarter's operating loss was about $60 million higher than a year ago, largely due to year-on-year increases in pension and other benefit expenses. Please turn to Slide 8 for some balance sheet and cash flow highlights. Fourth quarter free cash flow was $1.1 billion, up $330 million versus the fourth quarter of 2009, and we converted 119% of net income to cash. The increase was primarily due to lower pension contributions, along with a number of miscellaneous cash timing differences, partially offset by $250 million in higher capital expenditures. The CapEx increase is purely timing, as certain projects happened to close in 2010 but could have easily ended up in 2011. We are reducing our 2011 CapEx forecast from $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as a result, reflecting these 2010 accelerating capital projects. On a year-to-date basis, we generated a record $4.1 billion in free cash flow and converted 100% of net income to cash. Net working capital turns improved by 0.2 sequentially and were down by a similar factor year-on-year. Receivables rose in line with sales growth and remain under excellent control. Inventories rose 19% year-on-year as we've built inventory to support the outstanding fourth quarter and anticipated first quarter growth levels. Strong growth in emerging economies, coupled with our need to import product in several of those areas, will likely translate to higher inventory until we move even more manufacturing capability to emerging markets. Though not on the chart, I'd like to mention that fourth quarter acquisition investments totaled $1.4 billion, net of cash and marketable securities, as we successfully closed three sizable deals, Cogent, Attenti and Arizant. For the full year 2010, we returned more than $2.4 billion to shareholders via a combination of dividends and share repurchases, which is up 60% versus 2009. And you will note that we began repurchasing shares significantly in the fourth quarter. Year end is an appropriate time to provide a pension and postretirement benefits update, so please turn to Slide #9. On a worldwide basis, our pension and OPEB [post employment benefits] plans are 90% funded at year end, with the U.S. qualified plan at 97% and international plans at a combined 89%. U.S. pension plan assets returns were 14.4% in 2010, easily exceeding our assumed 8.5% ROA and a top quartile performance among large U.S. plans. For 2011, we will again assume 8.5% ROA in the U.S. qualified plan, along with a 5.23% discount rate, which is down 54 basis points versus 2009. We expect to contribute cash in the range of $400 million to $600 million in 2011. The exact amount will depend of course on actual asset returns for the year. Importantly, we do not have any mandatory funding obligations. The 2011 pension expense headwind will be now $0.22 per share, down from a previous estimate of $0.27 per share. For your modeling purposes, we will record about 2/3 of this headwind in the corporate and miscellaneous segment and the remainder amongst our business segments. If rates stay reasonably close to the current levels, pension expense will actually flip from a headwind in 2011 to a tailwind in 2012. Our trader team deserves a lot of credit, as they do  a fabulous job managing our pension and postretirement financial exposure. At this point, I'll turn the program back to George, who will address our forward outlook. Please turn to Slide #10.\nGeorge Buckley: Thank you very much, Pat. And let me first spend a few moments now on how we see 2010 playing out. A lot of the economic indicators are showing mild improvements lately. U.S. retail sales were up about 2% over the holidays. Growth in China remained strong at about 10%. And based on recent reports from GE and IBM, factory orders for capital goods and projects seem to have been increasing. We've also seen mild improvements in U.S. unemployment data. But I think in summary, there's still a lot of smoke without fire and that we should all remain cautious. We need to be sure it's really a dawn and not a forest fire coming our way. We will be increasing our capital spending in 2011 to about $1.3 billion, maybe $1.4 billion, but it's mostly being dedicated to o U.S. growth, hence our strengthening the manufacturing leadership overseas. I think that 3M's growth and that of the U.S. economy is still going to be strongly led by emerging markets. I don't expect to see big improvements in the U.S. until employment takes a material turn for the better, and any gains here are likely to be export-oriented. The [Audio Gap] Bush [Audio Gap] is the best news we've had, and we think that will make an incremental, measurable improvement in our outlook for the U.S. We're also bound to see some improvements in the U.S. in 2011, mainly because the base in a number industries has been so miserable. In some sectors such as existing housing, the stock of existing homes remains high and new housing starts continue to fall. Spring will probably see some improvements, but simply because it is spring, and we always see improvements there. Nevertheless, it will help. I think housing prices will continue to fall this year. And ultimately at some point, that will attract [Audio Gap] Thank you for your attention, and we're now happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Morgan Stanley.\nScott Davis: Guys, I know it's still early in the year, so I don't want to nitpick too much on guidance. But I'm struggling a little bit to reconcile if I kind of look at the numbers apples-to-apples, looks like you're targeting roughly 10% to 12% top line at the midpoint, roughly, let's say, x pension and vaca [ph] roughly 11%, 12% at the midpoint for EPS. And I guess my question is this, if your incremental expenses aren't going to go up substantially, as it relates to some of the comments, things like advertising, R&D, some of the past investments that you made that you don't expect the same ramp, why wouldn't incremental margins and the pull-through be a little bit better and allow you to get a little bit more leverage off of that? Is it just solely just Display and Graphics or is there some -- or just conservativeness on your part?\nPatrick Campbell: Well, it's probably not conservatism, Scott. If you look at the margin expectation in our guidance, that's really where we're targeting. It's gone to -- it's 21.5% to 23%.  But as George says, the 21.5% is really kind of reflecting some potential acquisitions that may play out towards the back half of the year that really don't add much in the way of income. So think of it as 22% range. So that's kind of about where we're targeting to run the business. If you think of it, though, from an EPS perspective, you got tax rates going up. We were 27.7% this year, even at the 29.5%. So that's a piece, you obviously got -- you got pension going up. We had some vacation benefit this year that obviously, we have to kind of offset as we go into next year. Our assumption is that basically our pricing material cost will be kind of flattish, that we'll be able to offset materials. So effectively, it's going to be whatever the kind of the volume pull-through is, and as we showed at the meeting, if you kind of look of that in kind of a 35% incremental margin or so forth, that's where that leads you.\nScott Davis: Well, we can kind of agree to disagree, because when I do the math, I get something like more 640, 650 on a 30% incremental. But let's move on to my second question. If you look at LCD TV, the commentary you made at the December meeting was fairly cautious. And can you give us a sense of kind of a State of the Union, incrementally January, now that we're towards the end of January, versus mid-December, have things stabilized? You mentioned that you brought inventories down, but how about the sell-through, we can we talk about that?\nPatrick Campbell: From my knowledge, of course, this is a very fast-moving space, Scott. So what I tell you today could be wrong next month. But to our knowledge right now, we've got good design of current models that are in production. Inventories are still a little bit on the higher side than I think the industry would like. But they've done a nice job of bringing them down. Early indications are in the quarter that activity seems to be very good. I'm very thankful we kind of adjusted our inventories here in the fourth quarter. So I think early in the year, if the sell-through works, which thus far, they're expecting that. Of course, there's a big Lunar New Year's in Asia in the first part of the year. Japan's going to go through a digital change, I believe, on June 1, so the first half the year is going to be quite important relative to sell-through in Asia. And we, of course, won't know that until probably into the second quarter how well that's going. But thus far, it seems to be progressing reasonably well.\nGeorge Buckley: Scott, I think it was a little better than we thought in the early part of the year. Attachment rates have also been a little bit better than we thought. The real key here is going to be how good are we at retaining that attachment rate. And typically, the profile that you see historically is that attachment rates are good in the early part of the year, because model change obviously take place later in the year. So really, we're probably going to do fairly well is my guess in the first part of the year, at least on the tax rates. Pricing, of course, Pat went over that in New York. It's still a tough issue in that marketplace, and that will be the thing that puts pressure on earnings and on leverage in the way that Pat described it earlier. So I think that whether we cross the finish line as successfully as we hope or better than we hope, is all really going to be determined by later in the year, perhaps in the last four months of the year of 2011.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Cornell with Barclays Capital.\nRobert Cornell: A couple of questions, again, going back to the top line growth guide, I mean, the 5.5% to 7.5%. I mean, are you still looking for the same 15% to 20% growth in the emerging markets, which would sort of imply the mid-range, 4.5% points of organic growth? I mean, so maybe because of the disaggregate that 5.5%, 7.5%, and maybe Pat can dial in the level of conservatism you've built in there.\nPatrick Campbell: No, it's really no different than we kind of shared in December.  We had a chart in December that talked about the segregation of sales, that developed markets probably would be in the 3% to 5% range, and developing would be in 10% to 12% range. If you said, \"Where is there any upside,\" I'd probably say it's more on the developing side than on the developed side, to kind of address your question.\nRobert Cornell: You mean, I guess, the subtext there is, I mean, some people talked about China slowing in late in '10. Have you seen any of that?\nPatrick Campbell: We have not, thus far. We just had our entire leadership together last week. We spent some time obviously with the Asian group, and specifically Kenneth, who runs China. And thus far, we have not seen any alteration, okay, in our growth rate in China at all.\nGeorge Buckley: Bob, the more recent growth rates in China are being up -- in emerging markets have been up above 30%, 31% or so. And that's still about a third, as we've told you before about a third of our sales. So there's no question, we get a great lift from that. Whether in the end we get to the top end of that growth range [ph], is all dependent on how these, shall we say, the more traditional and slower markets in Japan, in the United States and in Western Europe behave.\nRobert Cornell: Could you just give us some more color on the label initiative? I mean, consumer office didn't quite get there. You had some investment spending, I think, probably -- how much of that was in labels? Maybe just give us an idea of just how you're succeeding relative to plan there to push forward in that business broadly?\nPatrick Campbell: Yes, Bob. I'd say, you have to view this as being a long-term opportunity for us. This is not an initiative that you just necessarily win overnight. You've got a pretty well-entrenched competitor. We've made some very good inroads with certain of our SKUs. But it will take a while to really establish ourselves. It's also a relatively expensive conversion you have to go through, Bob, because one of the things that you have to do is, of course, you have to take the competitor's product off the shelf. A retailer is not going to just absorb that expense, so part of the conversion cost is to take somebody out effectively you've got to take over some of their inventory. So the transition is a little bit costly. But we're absolutely convinced it's the right long-term strategy. But it will be a couple of years before it really kind of, I think, you'll start to see big growth rates. But it's a very solid initiative, and we've got absolutely the right product. I think we have the right relationship with the retailers, so it's just a matter of time.\nGeorge Buckley: We've won one of them, Bob, completely over. Others we've won over in varying degrees. So I think, at this stage, so early in the transition, it's actually been quite successful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.\nSteven Winoker: Just a growth and then a margin question. On the growth side, looking at Health Care coming in on core growth at 1.6%, last quarter it was 1.5%, then you kind of had four quarters of 4.5% to 7.5%. I mean, when you think about your core growth going forward, how do you think about Health Care? Are we in a long-term period of this? You mentioned a lot of double-digit and other growth in your presentation. Where was it weak?\nPatrick Campbell: In Health Care, specifically?\nSteven Winoker: Yes.\nPatrick Campbell: I would say it was weak in -- our drug delivery systems business was a little weaker. Oral care is at more of a low single-digit rate at this point in time. Health Care is going through a pretty significant shift relative to, I'll call it the underlying market dynamics. We still see that obviously as a very good, very solid, solid business. But I think for a period of time, it's going to be kind of a more single-digit grower. But we've got some great efforts in places like Food Safety. We feel very good about this acquisition we just made in Arizant, okay, around patient warming and the like. And we've invested a fair amount in R&D and sales and marketing programs. And Brad and the team are aggressively going after international expansion as well. And that probably is where some of our best opportunities really are, in some of the developing market opportunities, to play as those markets develop.\nGeorge Buckley: And Steve, here's George. Just to give you kind of a little bit color. I don't think that long-term goals, that those Health Care markets are going to be struggling, because certainly there's going to be some reordering of the way that market behaves. People -- insurers are going to want you in the hospital and have the hospital equipped as you possibly can. So there are going to be growth in sort of secondary markets that we can and will address. So I think ultimately, in the end, unless the rate of accidents, the rate of illnesses begins to fall in a secular way, which is not reasonable to expect, I think with the kind of products that we supply, you'd expect, as long as we service each of those touch points, we're going to do okay. And as Pat rightly pointed, one of the great opportunities we just had the sort of first new regulations in 30 years in Food Safety, one of the great new opportunities there. And that's, roughly speaking, a couple of hundred million dollar business. It's already growing at double digits, and I expect that to accelerate. HES is another very good one. So all in all, I think we're going to be okay, although we will see the same kind of pressure that's being seen in other companies. I think we're going to see some of that for a while, and that probably won't change until unemployment begins to come back. And you ask yourself how long can people put this stuff off, but they actually do.\nSteven Winoker: And then a second question on margin. If I look at the 250 basis points year-on-year delta and then within that, the non-pricing related COGS, so 90 basis points, and you mentioned 3% increase in raw materials. So of the 90 basis points, would you say that just raws was 50% of that or 70% by my calcs? Or is it something different? And what about wage inflation and productivity as an offset?\nPatrick Campbell: I would say your number is relatively close on the materials side. On the weight side, we have a tendency that, I'll call it, our people productivity will offset generally any kind of wage inflation we have.\nSteven Winoker: So the other -- so it's mix. And can you comment...\nPatrick Campbell: The mix of materials, yes.\nSteven Winoker: And then as part of that, the SG&A and R&D, I'm just trying get a sense for how much of this was people and advertising and other investment versus sort of wage inflation or other negative things? In other words, how much of that is going to help growth versus just a tough cost?\nPatrick Campbell: Think of it as the bulk of it should help growth, okay, as compared to underlying cost inflation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal with FBR Capital Markets.\nAjay Kejriwal: Just following up on Optical Film, maybe you can provide some color on expectations for volume and then pricing this year. You talked about moving pieces in the first half, with China and then Japan. But if you could maybe provide us some color on  what do you think both volume could be and what's baked into your numbers.\nPatrick Campbell: Well, guess I'll try to -- one of the more of the difficult ones, obviously, to try to forecast. If you think of it more from a, I guess, a planning basis, we anticipating that the Optical revenue will be relatively flat year-on-year. That would imply that obviously you get some more volume and you have the continuous price-down nature of the business. That business usually runs something in the order of magnitude of a double-digit price, price reduction. So that'd probably be kind of the order of magnitude as we think about kind of the top line for this year.\nAjay Kejriwal: So just on that pricing, as inventory kind of stabilizes here, maybe end of first quarter into second, would you expect the pricing declines to kind of reverse back to the historical trend rate of 10%, 15%? Or any thoughts there?\nPatrick Campbell: As I said, it's a tough one to kind of deal with. In our planning, we are basically planning to be competitive in that marketplace. We have to, of course, negotiate every one of the new designs. So I would say that will be a more traditional price-down, would be kind of our expectations. The other thing that, of course, comes into play here is you're constantly innovating new designs. So getting to a pure price-to-price becomes a little more difficult in this business, just because the design is different, from one model to the next. But traditionally, what you'll see in high-tech, fast-growing markets, like, you see [ph] something in the order of a double-digit price reduction, so that's kind of what's our currently planning.\nGeorge Buckley: It all depends, Ajay, on the mix of sales. As Pat said, traditionally, this is a market that's got double-digit down-price. TV's parts has got double-digit down-price. Down-price obviously exists everywhere, but the mix of handhelds and monitors and laptops changes the overall mix a lot. And as Pat rightly pointed out, obviously, you're trying to innovate here, where price doesn't get sort of reflected in the overall model. So I mean, clearly what you've got is pressure on the one hand on price. But luckily with some increase in area volume. So you get absorption built into the equation. But it is a very, very fast-moving market. It is something that has these sort of aberrant times where these large corrections take place, where you've got shutdowns, fewer sales and pricing all combining in one set of pressures. So it is hard for us to predict any more really accurate than what we've told you already.\nAjay Kejriwal: Maybe one more if I can squeeze in very quickly, on R&D, up 19% in the quarter and you're close to 6%, so maybe if you can talk about where you versus expectations. And then George, if you can share any thoughts on the metrics you use on the efficiency of the spend there?\nGeorge Buckley: Well, you saw the number, or heard the number, Ajay, at 31.4%. So obviously, our R&D efforts have been very, very successful. And ultimately, it's this that drives our top line.  As long as we can protect cannibalization, it's what drives our top line. So it's very important to us. I don't really see any need to be increasing that dramatically beyond where it is today. So I think I'm quite happy where it stands. It might even back off a little bit in terms of total dollar volume. And we'll probably be holding the investments in our new business ventures and things like that at constant. But if you look at the numbers, I think we showed them in the December meeting, the productivity numbers have improved dramatically in R&D in the last few years. And I don't know ultimately where they can go. I suspect they're probably as far or close to being as far as we can go. But I'm happy with the number where it sits. And I don't want to increase it any more for now. We'll see how this stuff bears fruit.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.\nJeffrey Sprague: George, obviously, a little bit of a dust-up in the press, a month or two back, about the remainder of your tenure and how transition plays out. Can you just share some thoughts on what we should expect?  Perhaps someone gets elevated to President or something midyear as a kind of a way to signal what's going on and kind of just in general what the timeline is?\nGeorge Buckley: Well, in the end, to me personally, I'm going to -- unless I drop dead first, I'm going to work here as long as the board wants me to work here. So I'm not anxious to be going fishing just yet, although when the time comes, I will. Obviously, the board has been looking at the issues of transition very closely. We've been doing it for years, by the way, Jeff. This isn't something that started last year. It started almost the day that I walked through the door. Because I, for one, was determined that the next CEO of 3M was going to be an internal candidate, not an external candidate. And I think we've got ourselves into the position where that is. You know that we've got a lot of awards on our people development, and our folks here do this extraordinarily well. So later in the year, the board will, assuming it sort of arrives at a consensus, will make its announcements on how that transition takes place. I suspect that it'll be sort of classic profile. We'll have a few others step in between now and me ultimately retiring. And I think it'll all be very orderly, people will know everybody. It won't be a great surprise, it won't be a great threat, like someone coming from the outside. So I think it'll be a fairly well-managed and fairly orderly transition. And I hope, obviously, it's going to be very successful. I have a lot of personal self-interest in, and it's going very, very well.\nJeffrey Sprague: And also, just on really big picture stuff, and not to parse words, maybe it's a throwaway comment. But George, you kind of made the comment about, I don't know if we'll ever get proper recognition in your opening preamble, and I just wonder if you could elaborate on that thought. Obviously, you guys have made a lot of progress, and you've started to allocate capital a little bit differently. Maybe the jury's still out on how that all that works. But just what are your thoughts on overall strategy, capital allocation? Is there any change there?\nGeorge Buckley: Well, on driving the top line, Jeff, our long-range goal in 2015 is to have this NPVI number at 40%. So it's -- obviously a lot of money is still going to go into R&D. In terms of capital, I think increasingly, the proportion of spend will get made overseas, primarily in emerging markets, in low-tax areas, in low-cost areas, but not necessarily always in those places, because clearly, we've got good markets growing in the United States. And our model is near-to-market manufacturing. You can't with the kind of the supply chains we have always spend in low-cost markets. So we'll appropriately spend in these local markets. I think the pattern you're seeing on dividends will remain, that we'll keep dividends growing somewhere between the rate of inflation and the rate of earnings growth, depending on what other investment plans we have during the year. And I think you'll see us, as Pat already spoke about briefly, you'll see us picking up the pace of stock repurchase in the early part of this year as part and parcel of value return to the shareholders. So it's, I think, all in all, more emphasis on overseas investments in capital and probably, certainly this year, a little more emphasis on stock repurchases.\nJeffrey Sprague: Pat, how much actual deal dilution/purchase accounting, et cetera, was absorbed in the quarter? And what should we think about for 2011?\nPatrick Campbell: Well, I think speaking about 2011, we've got most of it behind us, relative to obviously the deals we had here in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, we'll have -- I guess first part of the year, we'll have maybe a couple of cents relative to Alpha Beta and Winterthur, assuming that obviously closes and so forth. It's not a significant number, Jeff. And fourth quarter was very similar to kind of what we had outlined going into the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citi Investment Research.\nDeane Dray: Just to follow up on Jeff's question on the capital allocation, specifically on M&A. Pat, I don't know if this was an intentional point, but you seemed to set expectations for that one to two percentage points of growth from deals being more of a back-half event. So maybe update us on the pipeline pricing, but is the back half -- because you did a flurry of deals at year end. Is there a pricing that is not appealing? Or why might it be pushed back to later part of the year?\nPatrick Campbell: I guess if I had a better crystal ball, I guess, we may have -- I mean, the reality is you never know exactly when these things are going to happen. Obviously, we've got a little more visibility as to what we have in the current pipeline that we're working at. So the ones we've announced will be the ones obviously in the first part of the year. So just realistically, by the time we act on them and by the time you get them closed, more than likely, they'll be more towards the mid to back half of the year, other than the ones that we've already talked about.\nDeane Dray: And any expectations or just observations on pricing and maybe geographies?\nPatrick Campbell: It's all too expensive for George [indiscernible] and me, but it's hard to generalize, okay? Sometimes you run into some small ones that we still feel that we get decent pricing, that we're a very good strategic fit with somebody. The more you try to play, and I'll call it, the public domain, sellers' expectations continue to rise as the market rises. So I don't think that's -- there's nothing secretive about that. So that's obviously something we have to just keep in our mind as to, I'll call it the relative -- our value versus their value. And just because the market goes up, doesn't always bring the shareholders any more value necessarily. So it's something we just have to keep a close eye on, which we have a very disciplined process to look at what we want to buy.  You just kind can't always anticipate when something pops.  We've got a strategic road map on what type of businesses we'd like to invest in. Obviously, we do a lot of prospecting ourselves as to businesses we'd like to go after. Sometimes you just don't know when things are going to show up on the radar screen. But pricing, to be honest with you, is kind of back to -- it was like the recession never happened.\nGeorge Buckley: I think in particular, Deane, the pricing in emerging markets are very high. If you look at some of the opportunities that are being purchased in India, they're well beyond the level of Pat and myself. So but there are other ways you can get at these by -- if you happen to come across a U.S. acquisition that's got one of those things already in place, they can add a nice little piece of the puzzle in India, say, for example, but at relatively modest prices. So I think ultimately, that market is going cool down. It just has to. The PEs that you see in that market are so stratospherically high. People just can't get the returns. So I think ultimately that will cool down, and we'll do a little bit of watching and waiting and probably opportunistic buying plus trying to buy by the backdoor in the way that I just outlined, at least in those markets, Deane.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies & Company.\nLaurence Alexander: Just wondered if you could sort of extend on your answer to the last question. As you think about M&A in some of the faster growth markets, I think you mentioned renewables were growing north of 70% this quarter. When you think back a year ago, the fact that you didn't do deals, was the issue the valuations? Or was the issue that you look at some of these fast growth markets and you're concerned about the sustainability? And I guess, the second question I have is a very quick one on gross margins. The lag that you're seeing between raw materials and pricing, is it fixable? Or do you think this will be structural at least for this cycle, given your business mix?\nGeorge Buckley: Well, Laurence, I think on pricing in these markets, if you go back and look at the question, did we or would we try to buy some things in these high-growth places, we did actually try to buy a number of businesses but in the end the prices were nosebleed, and we said, \"Look, there's still a return on investment, even with a very, very high-growth businesses like this.\"  So we have to be prudent and sensible about where we can. And we also have to think about the capabilities inside 3M.  We can grow a lot of this stuff ourselves, candidly speaking. I mean, you see that example in the labels market that one of our colleagues was asking about earlier. We have that capability. Why pay for something we can do on our own and to some degree have for nothing? So it all depends on what technology we have, what market presence we're trying to build and try to chase. And Pat and I are, I suppose, legendarily conservative on those sorts of things. And I don't think that's going to change dramatically. Nevertheless, we are seeing here and there some opportunities that are more modest in price, and we will look at those carefully. And if we can get the deals done, we'll do it. But I don't think you should expect to see any headlong sort of rush into things which are high-priced even though they are high-growth. I mean, ultimately, I don't think any market can be sustained just on the basis of government subsidies. So you have to sort of think about how this market matures to a place where it's self-sustaining. And that then might result in more secure but perhaps less expensive opportunities coming up  at time when the market is more mature. So we have to balance all of those things, sort of left and right, as we think about what to do now and what to do later.\nLaurence Alexander: And then just quickly on gross margins.\nPatrick Campbell: Yes, I think your original question on pricing material. George's comment, I think it'd be fair to say that we were a little slow, okay, to go after pricing. I don't see it being a structural change in this cycle. We've got pricing plans in place, and we'll go after these in this new year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.\nTerry Darling: Wondering if we might get a little bit more color on 2011 margin expectations by segment. And I guess, where I'm coming from is if we look x corporate, the segment operating income margin rolled up for all the segments at closer to higher end of your guidance, looks like up 75 or 100 basis points. And just wondering if you could talk through the segments, kind of what's above that? What's below that, for us? We danced around it a little bit, but maybe you can help put some more color there.\nPatrick Campbell: Realistically, when I look at, forget about quarters for a second, if you kind of look at the whole year is kind of the way it I have a tendency to more think of this. I don't really see a significant change in our margin structure that significantly. ECB's got some momentum behind it, okay? So maybe they'll be a little bit higher on a total year basis, on a year-on-year basis. But realistically, I think everybody else, okay, will be relatively close to where they were in 2010. Maybe industrial may have a little bit leverage in their business if they get some top line to them. But Health Care I think will be relatively similar. I think consumer relatively close to what it was this year. And again, all this is absent kind of any kind of new acquisition impact that may kind of be dilutive in a given business. But I don't really see a big change.\nTerry Darling: But I'm a little surprised with Optical flat, that maybe you wouldn't have said D&G down a little bit, which maybe suggest some greater strengths in the non-LCD part of Optical and/or the rest of D&G. Can you just comment on that?\nPatrick Campbell: I think, Terry, that would be a fair read, that Commercial Graphics has some good momentum behind it. We think TSS will do well in this side. We think the microprojector, okay, has some good legs to it. That team's done a greatish [ph] coming back.  So I do see it as being -- some of the other businesses helping to offset maybe a little bit of a lower number in Optical.\nTerry Darling: And again, just to clarify, then, so the optical piece margins would be down, the rest up and you end up about where you were this year?\nPatrick Campbell: That would be the right way to read it as we see it right now.\nTerry Darling: And then, George, maybe one more on this capital allocation, because the separation of companies in multi-industry is something that's -- you've [ph] got a lot of people talking. You've mentioned in the past or you've questioned in the past whether the market's really recognizing the value in the very high and sustainable margins in Health Care. You mentioned at the analyst meeting that maybe the Optical business has got so much volatility for the business model in the long term. Should the company be considering in this environment more seriously how the pieces of the total might on their own add up to more than what we see the market assigning value right now as?\nGeorge Buckley: Yes. It's an excellent question Deane (sic) [Terry],  and I'm asked the question often. And I really do, and I know people do try to do this. I try to sort of dissolve the notion that this is a conglomerate rather than a multi-technology company. Let's just sort of take Optical Films. These are shared between the -- I mean, the capabilities and patents are shared between Optical.  They're shared between the Renewables Energy business. Some of the work leaks into Traffic Safety. It leaks, to a lesser extent, or will leak in, to a lesser extent depending on how we do on lighting, into Consumer Office. So the problem is, Terry, that the technologies are shared. The plants are shared. The patents are shared. And it's not that easy in 3M as a general rule to pull out pieces of the business because of the way they're interlocked on shared plants and shared technologies. So it isn't nearly as easy. And it also, by the way, proves the point that we're not a conglomerate in the classic sense. Now, it doesn't mean that there aren't bits and pieces of the company that you couldn't sort of pull out and try to capitalize on. On the other hand, we try to figure out -- let's say we sold a big piece of the business.  By the time we paid the tax leakage, we might struggle to look for other opportunities that would drive growth anyway. So it isn't as easy in this particular company, Terry, as it is in pretty much any other company that I've seen. And so a lot of this stuff is very sticky in its interrelationships and its sharing. And the way, actually, we use some of these platforms, in curious ways from Automotive going into Health Care, from Dental going into Automotive in a way that most people would not see. So while I know the thing you're referring to, ITT's recent sort of dissolution, shall we say, it really isn't as easy an issue, nor as relevant an issue, in our particular company.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.\nJames Sheehan: This is James Sheehan in for David this morning. Just on raw materials. Pat, you mentioned price in raw materials would be roughly balanced in 2011. And given that we had a 2% rise in raw materials this past year, could you just quantify for us your expectations as to what raw materials will increase this year?\nPatrick Campbell: I would say it would be similar at this point in time. At this juncture, I guess, I'd say I still have a little bit of a concern, could we see a little bit higher, a higher inflationary number this year play out. But kind of from a planning standpoint, it would probably be pretty similar.\nJames Sheehan: And then just on the share count, can you just elaborate on the increase in the share count sequentially? And how do you see buybacks impacting the share count in 2011?\nPatrick Campbell: I guess we have to get back to you. Because I actually think sequentially share count, I think, probably comes down a little bit with our buyback activity. But we'll kind of talk to you offline on that. But generally speaking, what we've talked about in December was a gross repurchase program of maybe $2 billion or so in the 2011 period.\nGeorge Buckley: We'll come back to you on the shares.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Feldman with UBS.\nJason Feldman: I know that you don't give quarterly guidance. But given the unusual comps last year varying across the year, much harder on the first half, is there anything we need to keep in mind when thinking about the progression of earnings over the course of '11 that differs from normal seasonality?\nPatrick Campbell: Jason, offhand, I can't think of anything from a macro perspective or kind of a company strategy standpoint that would necessarily be a kind of a different mix during the year. I hate to bring up optical again, okay, but optical can have some pretty significant differences by quarter. But generally speaking, our seasonal patterns don't change all that much. So what we had last year, of course, is, in '10, we had a kind of a growth strategy that we wanted to get out of the first quarter and make sure we started solidly, but then we kind of had a series of growth programs ramping up through the year. So we knew going in that we'd have a kind of a, I'll call it a margin profile that was a little bit better the first half of the year than it was back half of the year. I don't see that same thing playing out this year. I think what you ought to see is more kind of a even margin structure going through the year but nothing different really from a top line perspective.\nJason Feldman: Early last year, you attributed some of the extremely strong organic growth to share gain, and for some competitors were weakened coming out of the downturn. As conditions have kind of normalized over the last couple of quarters, have you seen any change in competitive position, different competitive environment? I think, George, you alluded to greater strength from some of the smaller companies in emerging regions lately.\nGeorge Buckley: Let me pick that up, Jason. Certainly, the numbers last year show that we continue to gain share. We obviously gained share, so I expect in some businesses more than others.  But net-net, probably around 0.5% if you do the mathematics. I really don't expect that to change a great deal. I'm hoping that we can continue that strategy. A piece of the growth comes from share, that we build the capability and the presence of our company in these markets step-by-step, gradually. But it was really a sort of a -- rather than a note of caution, so much, although it was a note of caution, is it explains why we have to be more local, because these small companies, Jason, many of them are growing very, very rapidly, and they're very able and very nimble. Unless you try to the extent that you can to be like them, they're going to go eat your lunch. So I think the strategy that we followed of more globalization, more localization of manufacturing, of leadership, of technology and increasingly, of manufacturing is a good sort of shield against that kind of pressure. But ultimately, it is going to be about our speed, our efficiency and our ability to be competitive in each of those markets, in every single segment that we compete in. If we do that, we have nothing to fear from them.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan Securities.\nC. Stephen Tusa: Just a question on D&G. I'm sorry to bring this up again. I was having trouble reconciling the results. Revenues were up year-over-year, yet the margin was down. I understand the Optical business was weak. But it was still up year-over-year. And so I'm just curious as to how that -- is that a mix issue that the businesses that grew -- I know there's other businesses that are picking up the slack for Optical and that's kind of a dynamic you expect into 2011. But is there something with regard to the profitability of those businesses that's an incremental drag along with what's happening at D&G or at Optical? Or is this just like a horrendous Optical quarter that we're going to cut and climb out over the next several quarters?\nPatrick Campbell: And Steve, you're talking about fourth quarter by itself, not the year, right?\nC. Stephen Tusa: Yes, fourth quarter D&G, correct.\nPatrick Campbell: Yes, and what really the issue is, and really it's an Optical, it really primarily is an Optical issue. And what happened in that business is that even though the top line was relatively okay, our manufacturing output was way down in the fourth quarter. When we looked at inventories in the channel and kind of what the customers were saying, and kind of what we talked about in our December meeting, we took a decision to really significantly alter our production volumes in the fourth quarter. And I think the number I heard is that our output may have been about half of what it was last year for the fourth quarter. So you have some high-volume manufacturing assets that aren't making much in the quarter, and that has impact a pretty significant impact on your margins. So I think I kind of isolated it to be more [indiscernible] of that situation in the fourth quarter.\nC. Stephen Tusa: How did you guys get stuck with that much inventory? I mean, was that a -- because that's a pretty decent amount, that's a pretty big disconnect between sell-through and what you actually produce. I mean, I don't think the retail volumes were bad, but I mean, were they that bad, or is this just the visibility in the chain...?\nPatrick Campbell: Well, Steve, part of it was, okay, that obviously there continued to be build in the channel, okay, not only at the retail sector but all the way back through the manufacturing processes. We've been running 24 by 7 in that operation all year long. Customers kept demanding more and more product from us. And those were still the signals that we were getting going into the fourth quarter. But it becomes very clear that when you look at what the inventory channel looks like, that's including the backlight manufacturer  okay, and so forth, that they had excess inventory.  So it takes a while to get the entire supply chain cleansed, okay, of where you have the imbalances. So it is fair to say that there was a build-ahead that effectively led to excess inventory going into the fourth quarter. So we decided that it was the right time to get ourselves squared around in the fourth quarter. But if you look at it for a whole year, if you look at Optical on a total year basis, they really had a very nice business result across the year. It's just that the fourth quarter was weak.\nC. Stephen Tusa: Yes, certainly, and growth was good in the fourth quarter.  And then just one follow-up on Health Care. What do we think, or what do we expect for the margin in Health Care next year? Is that kind of a flattish type of performance? Or will there be a little bit of pressure there, given volumes are still kind of trending a little bit weaker than the long-term growth rate there?\nPatrick Campbell: Well, it ended the year, I think, at 30.2%. I expect it'll be in that ballpark next year.\nGeorge Buckley: Steve, this is George. One last point before we ring off. I think just to sort of underscore what you said about the toughness of the fourth quarter in Optical, I think that business suffered something like 8% or so down price in the year. Maybe it was 9%. But about half of that was stuck, attributable to the fourth quarter. And that's why you heard Pat say that we expected double-digit down-price going forward in the current year. So it really was, as you said, it was a tough transition for that quarter, very, very low production and very, very high pricing pressure.\nC. Stephen Tusa: So that business had the below 10% margin? Or was that still -- saw a double digit?\nGeorge Buckley: No, no, it was still in double digit.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.\nMatt Ginter: Well, thanks for joining us, everybody. Appreciate your patience. A lot of good questions. And thanks for your interest in our company, and we'll look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nGeorge Buckley: Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Well, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the [Audio Gap]"}, {"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 3, "year": 2010, "date": "2010-10-28 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nMatt Ginter: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Before we begin, just a quick reminder. On the morning of Tuesday, December 7, we'll host our annual outlook meeting at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York City. Those of you that are on our e-mail distribution list should've received an invitation earlier this week. Please RSVP as soon as you can and for those of you who are not on our list who would wish to go, just drop a note or call and we'll take care of you. Take a moment if you would to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 2. During today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ from our predictions. So let's begin today's review. I'll turn the program over to George Buckley. Please turn to Slide 3.\nGeorge Buckley: Thank you very much, Matt. And good morning, everybody and thank you very much for joining us on our third quarter call. It was another very strong quarter for 3M as we continue to drive our growth plan and overall, Q3 sales and earnings were in line with our expectations. And if you can imagine, I'm especially pleased with the 11% increase in organic volume because of the backdrop of continued economic uncertainty and tougher comps. Organic volumes are now up 16% through September and we continue to set sales and profit records. Q3 sales brought in a new record for 3M, with the strongest growth coming in E&C -- Electro and Communications business, where sales were up 25%; Display and Graphic, where sales were up 19% and Industrial and Transportation, where they were up 14% and Consumer & Office, which was up an impressive 11%. And they, for example, exceeded $1 billion in sales for the first time ever in a quarter. Health Care and Safety and Security is still robust, but both had some peculiarities to deal with in the quarter, which I'll explain in a minute. We continue to grow across all geographies, once again reinforcing our international growth strategy. Sales in emerging markets as a whole were up 25% in the quarter and now exceeds 34% of total company sales. Asia Pacific grew 28%, Latin America grew 14% and Canada, 13%. Korea was up 48%, India 39%, Russia 32% and the China region was up 31%, with Brazil up 25% as well. Operating margins remain strong at 23%, with all businesses staying at operating margins of 20% or higher. EPS was $1.53, up 13%, another all-time Q3 record for 3M. Free cash flow was $1.1 billion, with nearly 100% conversion rate. We also continued our accelerated investments in the future. We consider that this is extraordinary important in solving the puzzle of higher growth rates longer term. So, for example, we increased R&D investment by 6% year on year and we supported our brands with increased advertising and merchandising expense of more than 30%. The business venture investments, which are those investments outside R&D, continue to track at about $100 million additional annual spend year-over-year. We put more capital work by closing the acquisitions of Arizant and Attenti Holdings and we acquired a majority stake in Cogent Inc. and in early October, we also announced the acquisition of Alpha Beta, which is expected to close in the first quarter of next year. I'll address those acquisitions in more detail in a few moments. Overall, the strength of 3M's portfolio was again evident in the third quarter. Industrial and Transportation, which is the giant of 3M's businesses, where sales rose a huge 14% with broad-based double-digit local currency growth in every single unit led by Renewables Energy division, which was up 83% in sales and limited solely by manufacturing capacity, which we're adding as fast as we can. The growth is everywhere in industrial. As examples, Energy and Advanced Materials rose to 25%, Abrasives was up 18%, Automotive OEM was up 17% and Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, which is our largest business, was up 13%. As evidenced in our success in Automotive, Q3 will ride Automotive growth of up 10% while 3M's organic volumes are up 18%. Year-to-date, worldwide automotive builds are up 29%, while 3M's organic volumes are up 40%. Operating income for the sector rose by 14% to $446 million, with operating margins at 20.2%. A remarkable reinvention of this heartland of 3M's business by AC Shen [ph] and his team is nothing short of stunning. Health Care. Sales rose there by 1.5% in local currency, which is much slower than we've seen in recent quarters. The most evident impact in the quarter was the reduced H1N1 related demand, which lowered year-on-year growth rates by full two percentage points. You recall that H1N1 demand was the highest in the third quarter of last year. Low-core demand seems to be related to the uncertainty surrounding of Obama care. You've seen that pattern reflected in pretty much every company reporting so far in the Health Care space. Hospital admissions and treatments are down at many U.S. hospitals so distributors are wary and evidently running down inventories. As an illustration, I recently read that 50% of Cincinnati hospitals have reported lower admissions. Higher unemployment and weaker financial seem to be closing people to pull off elective procedures and even normal health care as well. We have no reason to believe that this is anything other than temporary effect and that it will pass. But clearly, there is caution everywhere as we we've seen similar slowing in Western Europe. That's a news with our Skin and Wound Care business was up 7%, Food Safety, absent of divestiture we did last year was up 12%; and Dental was up 4%. Operating income in Health Care was $326 million, with margins just short of 30%. At our December outlook meeting, we'll give you some additional views on how Health Care reform might affect our business. But the short form is that the impact is likely to be felt more in expensive treatments and advanced devices where we think rationing through tough pricing mechanisms is going to be the highest. Of course, the impact is just U.S.-based. While it's clear everyone is going to be affected, we feel that our business, which is mostly consumables and broadly based internationally, is less likely to be problematic. Health Care remains a very strong franchise for 3M. Moving on, local currency sales in Display and Graphics were up 18.4%, another excellent quarter. Optical system sales were up 28%, driven by new products for LED flatscreen televisions. In September, we saw the beginning of the much talked about and highly-anticipated inventory adjustment in the LCD TV industry, and we expect it to continue into the fourth quarter. This is clearly just the market adjustment as our film attachment rates remain as strong as ever. The inventory correction cost is about $15 million of earnings in the third quarter. Overall, I'm very pleased with the way our Optical business has matured and progressed. It wasn't that long ago that a hiccup in this business would cause us enormous heartburn. Yes, today, we still feel it and it's always going to be a tough industry but genetically, turns on a dime so to speak, just as it did in September. We have a much better understanding of the market dynamics and how to manage them and we have absolutely superb management team in place to do it. We're building that what we've done in 3M's traditional non-optical core. Over the last five years also means that our optical business no longer has to hold the sales and earnings growth wagon more or less alone. We're so much more diverse in growth now than we once were. When Optical catches a cold, yes, it still means 3M taking a bit of nasty medicine but the company no longer gets about a figurative bubonic plague. Continuing with display, commercial graphics continued the strong recovery, with impressive double-digit sales growth. Growth is coming from innovative new products right across and up and down the market spectrum. We also had positive growth in traffic safety systems, quite an accomplishment really, considering there's still no high refunding build in the United States. Total Display and Graphics operating income rose 37% to $282 million with margins of 26.4%. Consumer and Office had a great Quarter 2, significantly outpacing growth at the retail level and they topped $1 billion in sales for the first time ever. Joe Holland and his team drove 11.1% local currency sales growth with a full nine points of organic growth. Yes, nine points and another two points from acquisitions. Office products and the DIY business both achieved double-digit local currency sales growth and Health Care and stationery products reached high, single-digit growth too. As was the case last quarter, we increased advertising and merchandising investment by over 30% year on year and that pushes advancing many of our key brands. Operating income for consumer office was $235 million, with margins of 23%. Safety, Security and Protection Services sales were down 1.6% in local currency. Operating profit for SS&PS was $164 million, with margins of 20.2%. This is truly a wonderful sector, as in Health Care, H1N1-related demand did not repeat in the third quarter of 2010, in this case impacting year-on-year growth for SS&PS by a whopping 10%. The grocery products were also at margins strongly accretive to both the Security segment margins and to 3M as a whole. Consequently, operating margins declined 700 basis points year on year, which is entirely explained by H1N1 and secondarily, by the impact of image protections in the Roofing Granules business, both of which we consider to be temporary effects. Going forward, Safety and Security margins in the fourth quarter will still be negatively affected by these same factors, as well as by purchase accounting for Cogent and Attenti. These lapping impacts are purely an arithmetic issue with nothing fundamental to be concerned about. Margins will normalize around 23% as the H1N1 comps finish passing through the system sometime in the first half of next year. In the core of this business, we saw a double-digit sales increases in Security Systems, Corrosion Protection, Building and Commercial Services and also in Occupational Health and Environmental safety, if we exclude the H1N1 effects I mentioned earlier. Electro and Communications. Sales in local currency were up 24%, with currency translation adding another point and a half on top. I think it's important to note the continued strength in our business servicing the consumer electronics industry. For example, local currency sales were up 59% in electronic markets materials and 30% in Electronic Solutions division. In addition, we saw a double-digit local currency sales growth in electrical markets, which mainly serves utilities and electrical distribution. Local currency sales were up slightly in the Telecom Infrastructure business also. Electro and Communications drove operating income of $173 million, which is up 49% as operating margins expanded 3.6 percentage points, up to 22.4%. So all in all, even with some transient H1N1 and raw material cost impacts, this is another very strong performance across the board for 3M. I'd like to peek now for a moment about acquisitions. We significantly strengthened our Safety and Security business by adding Attenti and Cogent to their portfolio. Cogent brings to 3M a technology platform that we didn't have previously with its finger, palm and iris based biometric technologies, and Attenti positions us well in the segment of law enforcement that we didn't have access to until now, as well as opening opportunities for us in the eldercare and other industries. Both of these businesses are operating markets growing at greater than 20% annually. We see Attenti as a completely new, high-growth platform. We've long believed that high value asset tracking is a great future business. The logical application extensions to military, first responder, eldercare, mobile hospital assets, mining safety, animals and even in children, if you decide it, are massive. In Health Care, the acquisition of Arizant bolsters our infection prevention business by solidifying our position in the growing area of patient safety, with its line of patient and body fluid warming systems. This market is growing at double-digit rates and is likely to accelerate since the focus on body core warming is specifically laid out in the new Health Care legislation and is seen as a fundamental method to the reduction of cost control of hospital flame infections. Today, this is predominantly a U.S. business and we intend to leverage 3M's world-class international footprint to expand it overseas. Alpha Beta, in our Industrial segment, perfectly exemplifies our pyramid strategy in action by adding B and C-care products to our own line of tape offerings. Alpha Beta is a world-class ultra low-cost tape manufacturer located in the China region. Over the coming years, we expect growth rate to be very high and we'll in-source a lot of currently outsourced tape manufacturing to Alpha Beta. This is positioned right where the fastest growth is, both geographically and segment wise. And importantly, it establishes a low-cost tape manufacturing beachhead in Asia, something we didn't have before. So this is a great business, accretive addition to one of our most powerful core businesses. It's not an overstatement to say that 3M is the greatest Adhesives tape manufacturer in the world so investing here is perfectly logical for us. On R&D, you will note that for 3M, investment in innovation is investment in our future. In the third quarter, R&D investments were north of 5% of sales and we expect to maintain this level going forward. As a result of these investments, our New Product Vitality Index is now in the 32% range as we continue to drive innovation right across 3M. More than a year ago, we forecasted economic growth will slow in the second half of 2010 in some of our markets. Some folks disagreed with us, thinking that perhaps moving too conservative, but I think things had played out largely the way that we anticipated and so the trend is no longer a surprise. Part of this is purely arithmetic year-over-year comparisons, but part is also clearly economic. Looking ahead, the good news is that we've seen no signs of any broadscale, broad-based double dip. If it does come, we believe it would be limited in geography, short in duration and relatively mild. Our overall growth remains good in those geographies where we expect it to be good and it's hard where we expect it to be hard. No, we have not seen China slowing and ironically, if the R&D does begin to appreciate, it will provide you mostly net positive benefits. After all, we're highly profitable there and a net importer to China. Excluding Japan, which itself had a 10.5% local currency growth in the quarter, similar positive observations could be made for Asia broadly and for Latin America, the Middle East and Central and Eastern Europe. The practical reality is that those companies with broad footprints in emerging markets will prosper as long as they remain able to compete with small and fast growing local competitors. And for that, you absolutely must be cost competitive. For the near-term implications for the United States and Western Europe, Germany in part, are inspiring. We expect an extended period of slow recovery in these markets. The best news is that the recovery in automotive and a positive look in housing will look like enormous percentage changes. More broadly, U.S. factory utilization remains low, which implies a long recovery period in commercial construction. Industry transients in the industrial distribution channel have died down so they're no longer healthy. Unemployment remains, I think, as we all know, the key to the puzzle, particularly in the United States. Nothing in the end markets suggest big changes in anything, plus or minus, except the numbers will look arithmetically slower. Invention and penetration remain the keys to grow fast in these slow markets and that's why the R&D and business development investments that we spoke about earlier are essential. Breakthroughs in power distribution, smart grid, solar, environmental and innovation more generally, still provide big opportunities. Differentiation still works and 3M has that in its space. So gradual geographic realignment of our sales force may be needed to fully take advantage of opportunities in faster growing states and market spaces. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Pat for a review of the third quarter P&L.\nPatrick Campbell: Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide #6. Sales rose 11% in the third quarter, which was the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales improvement. Organic volume rose 10.8% in the quarter, net growth was 1.4x worldwide industrial production as the business continues to expand in size in terms of sales, operating income and economic profit. We drove 23% organic volumes in Asia Pacific, with both consumer electronics and the base business increasing over 20%. So our strategy around both export-oriented business and meeting local demand is working very well. Organic volumes grew 13% in Latin America, 6% in the U.S. and 4% in Europe, so no geography was left behind. Acquisitions added 50 basis points to growth from the quarter and selling prices declined just 20 basis points year on year. Third quarter gross profit dollars grew 9% year on year and notably, were more than 5% above Q3 2008 levels. For our strategy to grow the business is resulting in higher gross profits. Gross margin percent declined 90 basis points, with higher raw materials accounting for about one half of the change. Material inflation was approximately 2.5% year on year. Sales mix also negatively impacted gross margins in the quarter. As an example, H1N1-related respirator demand was strong in Q3 of last year and factory utilization levels in the businesses were very high. Those same factories ran at more normal levels this year. A lower sales contribution from Health Care, coupled with these attractive gross margins, also impacted the mix negatively. Helping to mitigate these factors were savings due to yield improvements, waste reduction, faster line speeds and ongoing productivity, driven by our Six Sigma teams around the world. In the SG&A area, sales and marketing investments rose 18% in the quarter while administrative and other costs were up just slightly. So in total, SG&A was up 13%. We anticipated this in our planning as we mobilize throughout the year to increase both sales coverage and marketing strength, particularly in fast-growing emerging economies. In addition, we increased investment in advertising and merchandising by over 30% year on year to drive higher sales volume with our customers, both now and into the future. We invested $354 million in research and development in the quarter, up nearly $20 million over last year's third quarter. Operating income was $1.6 billion, the highest of any third quarter on our history and margins are now standing 22.9%. All six reporting segments posted 20% plus margins, the third consecutive quarter that we have accomplished this feat. Our corporate miscellaneous reporting segment showed a small loss this quarter versus the first six months run rate. This was largely due to lower corporate spending, various compensation-related adjustments and a few other miscellaneous items. By its nature, profit loss in this segment can swing a bit from quarter to quarter. On a September year-to-date basis, the operating loss in corporate miscellaneous is larger than 2009 by $117 million, with the difference largely attributable to higher pension expense. The third quarter tax rate was 26.8%, down about five points year on year due to more effective international rates and reflects some of the great progress we have made in reducing our tax rate. We expect that the full year reported tax rate will be approximately 28.5%. Earnings were $1.53 per share on a GAAP reported basis, an increase of 13%. This also was a third quarter record for the company. Now let's look at the year-to-date results, so please turn to Slide #7. We are very pleased with how the business has performed thus far in 2010 and are running ahead of our expectations going into the year. September year-to-date sales were up 17%, nearly all driven by organic volume improvements. Asia and Latin America have been the stars in terms of geographic performance. On a business-by-business basis, growth has been the strongest in the Electro and Communications at 31%, Display and Graphics at 29%, and Industrial and Transportation at 22%. These three businesses have done an outstanding job at launching new products and taking share in a number of important and growing industries, including Consumer Electronics, Automotive OEM, General and Industrial, and Renewable Energy. Year to date, SG&A spending is up 11%, investments in sales and marketing are up 14%, a combination of more sales related fee demonstrate in growing markets, further investments to strengthen our marketing capability and as you see on this chart, a near 30% increase in advertising and promotion to drive current and long-term growth. Tight control over G&A remains a top priority for the company as it help speed additional investment in sales and marketing and R&D. On a year-to-date basis, G&A is up only 5% compared to sales growth of 17%, so we continue to drive leverage in this area. Operating income is up 33% year-to-date and operating margins are over 23%. All businesses are in 20% plus margins to the first nine months of the year. The reported tax rate through nine months was 28.3%, down from 31.2% in 2009. Recall that our tax rate was 34% five years ago, so we're making us some progress in this area. We expect the rates to tick up a bit in 2011, which I'll talk more about in a moment, but we remain committed to further long-term reductions in our rate. Evolving the manufacturing base to lower tax jurisdictions will be critical to making this happen. Finally, year-to-date net income and earnings per share rose 40% and 36%, respectively. Return On Invested Capital was a strong 22%. Please turn to Slide 8 for a balance sheet and cash flow discussion. Free cash flow is $1.1 billion in the third quarter and we converted nearly 100% of net income to cash. This was $466 million less than the third quarter of 2009, driven largely by three factors: One was pension contributions, as we contributed $241 million more than we did last year. In addition, the year on year difference in cash taxes paid was $111 million. Finally, working capital changes reduced free cash flow by $175 million to meet the volume demands. On a year-to-date basis, we generated nearly $3 billion of free cash flow and converted 94% of net income to cash. Networking capital turns remained steady year-over-year at 5.1 turns. We had some improvement on the receivables side, offset by somewhat higher inventories, aligned of course again to the higher growth rates. Acquisition activity has been light in the first three quarters of the year. As we have recently announced and George has mentioned earlier, we'll close a number of deals during the fourth quarter, plainly use some of our excess cash. Through nine months of 2010, we returned more than $1.5 billion to shareholders via a combination of dividends and share repurchases, a 43% increase versus 2009. With three quarters of the year behind us, let me address our outlook for the year. Please turn to Slide #9. We now expect our organic volume growth will come in between 13.5% and 14% for the year versus the prior forecast of 13% to 15%. We also expect that earnings per share will fall somewhere within the bend of $570 million to $574 million. This range includes estimated acquisition related dilution of approximately $0.06 per share related to the recently closed deals which are of course not factored into our July guidance. On a GAAP reported basis, we expect earnings to finish for the year between $5.59 and $5.63 per share. We anticipate that operating margins will be approximately 22.5% for the year, which also as I previously mentioned acquisitions. The full-year tax rate is expected to be at or just below 28.5% on a reported basis and average diluted shares outstanding should be in the bend of $725 million to $727 million for 2010 in total. Please turn to Slide #10. As Matt mentioned, we'll be hosting an investor meeting in the morning of December 7, in New York. We'll address our detailed 2011 outlook at that meeting, but I thought I give you a preview this morning. But please wait for the December meeting for some more specifics. At the moment, we are targeting 2011 sales growth of 11%, assuming a couple of points of acquisitions in current FX rates. We are driving the business to deliver 35% incremental margins on an organic growth. Outside of those incrementals, currency should be an additional income tailwind for us, again reflecting current exchange rates. We estimate that pension expense will be a $0.30 headwind next year. This assumes that the 4.86% discount rate at the end of the third quarter falls until year end, which, in our opinion, is an unsustainably low level. But regardless, it is down nearly a point from 5.77% that we used at last year end. The 2011 expense estimate also assumes U.S. asset returns of 11%, which was our actual performance through the first nine months of the year Finally, the $0.30 headwind assumes that we make an additional $700 million contribution to our pension plan, assuming current discount rates and asset return performance will always hold. But candidly, the actual contribution may differ. If rates or returns move our way, which have happened thus far in October, we would likely contribute much less than this. We don't have any mandatory funding obligations. What is most important for us is to be adequately funded at year end and to keep the earnings headwind at a manageable range. The anticipated expense increase is due to two factors: One is the amortization of prior period investment returns, namely the 13.6% loss experienced in 2008, and I'll remind you though, this was far better than the 30% market decline for that year. The second factor is the absolute level of interest rates. More rates, of course, increase the present value of liabilities, which in turn increase future pension expense. We also anticipate an $0.08 per share headwind due to our compensation policy change. As a reminder, prior to 2009, we allowed employees to bank a certain amount of unused vacation. Effective January 1, 2009, we moved to a user to loser approach and employees were given two years since the last time we have previously banked vacation. This change resulted in an $0.08 per share benefit in our 2010 results, which does not repeat itself in 2011. This item is non-cash, income statement only. Helping to offset this will be additional productivity gains due to the fact that employees will have less time off in 2011, which will help rein in additional hiring. Finally, at this early stage, we're expecting a 2011 tax rate of 30% or slightly below versus an estimated reported tax rate of 28.5% for 2010. We have some more work to do before reviewing our final 2011 plan with you in December but this should give you a sense of where we are headed. In summary, I would conclude that our year-to-date results are very much in line with our longer-term strategy. We're driving faster growth, reinvesting to secure the future of the business and maintaining best-in-class margins and return on capital. Our balance sheet remains in great shape, so regardless of the shape of the economic recovery, we'll have a significant funding advantage. That concludes the formal portion of today's conference call. So let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Robert Cornell of Barclays.\nRobert Cornell: Despite having a good quarter, but I think you mentioned an inflection point, September, maybe you could just go over that a little bit more and you talked the impact of the fourth quarter maybe just give us some visibility there, please?\nGeorge Buckley: Well, obviously, Bob you see every two years, you see these kind of corrections that take place in inventory. The great news for us is we haven't lost any attachment as far as we can tell, which is unlike what happened to us before. So this is probably just started. I think it'll go through the system, the potential impact in the fourth quarter you see across in the end, you don't know where this market changes so rapidly but the net impact we think might be as much as $70 million in our fourth quarter earnings. But...\nRobert Cornell: That's on profit, George?\nGeorge Buckley: That's on profit, yes. So that's the sort of numeric number there, Bob. But I think what has really happened so well here is we've got very close to these customers, they like our innovation, it captures in the product and that is for us the most important thing and we'll live through these things. And as I said, we've had these things come and go before. This time, of course, you say it puts some pressure on earnings but it's not the kind of outs that it once would've been.\nRobert Cornell: So you mentioned the Alpha Beta acquisition and you talked about putting some product back in-house that have been outsourced and the whole push into the better adjacency, I mean, what sort of profitability level would Alpha Beta see relative to the 3M average when you have that strategy completed?\nGeorge Buckley: Well, at their current operating margins, Bob, they would be dilutive to 3M but when you bring them altogether, I mean, first of all we don't need to invest a lot of G&A in that area since it not always branded product and we think it's just this huge growth and leverage opportunities in that space, Bob. I mean, we were selling into that space and paying high prices than we'll get from Alpha Beta. So actually, I think it will be helpful for us in the long run. And obviously, this is not competitive positioning at the bottom of the marketplace, which has always been the place where we've got attacked by growing sort of low-cost competition. So this is strategically very important for us, not only to provide growth but to provide the kind of bulwark to our higher-margin, higher-performing tapes, higher fee at the market premium. So it's very important, I think, Bob.\nPatrick Campbell: Bob, I'll just going to add just to kind of build on George comment. You have either the divisional level, which is our largest division is Adhesives and Tapes. As George mentioned, our objective there is we'll pull this in into some of the cost savings we have through in sourcing and the like that the margins in that business should hold where there truly out at the divisional level.\nRobert Cornell: So the margins at the division level would be the same when you consolidate Alpha Beta and push forward?\nPatrick Campbell: Yes, absolutely.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Morgan Stanley.\nScott Davis: Guys, it wasn't 100% clear to me why you didn't have a little bit more of a margin pullthrough in Industrial and Transportation. I understand there's some raw material headwinds and such, but given that type of growth rate in that type of business, maybe we would've expected a little bit more incremental margin. Can you give us a little bit more detail on that?\nPatrick Campbell: Yes. First of all, Scott, a 20% of margin in Industrial business is a damn good margin. We're obviously investing in that business. We're investing in new technology, putting the new investment in a lot of the emerging markets and so forth. Reality is the margin in that business will be probably the 21%, 22% range over time. It's a little bit lower this quarter, but nothing to be alarmed with. It's something that we've been kind of expecting through the time based on the investments that we're making. So no alarm from our side at all as to where the margins in that business are.\nScott Davis: So the answer is basically investments that you -- now, would we think of that as investment, some things that you put forward just given how strong every year you had discretionary spend and such that were pulled forward in the quarter?\nPatrick Campbell: Yes. It'd be fair to say and I think if we go back a couple of calls that in my comments really for the year to date is that we are running ahead of where we thought we would be for the year. So we had a number of investments lined up that, if conditions awarded effectively, we would pull into 2010 here. So that's kind of just one example of an area that has occurred.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.\nJeffrey Sprague: Can we -- I guess, I'll make my question and my follow-up around the deals. First, when you look at largely what you've acquired here, George, I would say they have kind of the feel of being a bit more equipment-related companies with the exception of Alpha Beta, rather than being kind of materials, plans-related company, which is kind of the core strength and bailiwick of 3M. So just as a matter of kind of philosophically when you look at adjacencies for your businesses, how you manage that the challenge that some of these are software companies in a sense and just the kind of the DNA for the organization to kind of do these types of deals going forward.\nGeorge Buckley: We've long recognized that one of the big growth areas for the future is going to be kind of software and electronics. In fact, if you look at our strapline, Jeff, over the last few years, you see this kind of creeping in bit by bit. In fact, maybe not creeping anymore, it's galloping. And so we recognize that this is going to be more the future, a bigger piece of our portfolio in the future. If you look at some of these high-growth spaces, ultimately, they're about sort of tracking and decision-making, ultimately is connected to electronics and software. So I think you're right in that area. These are very high growth areas, and we have some sort of related businesses already, Jeff. You might remember we've got library equipment business that tracks library books. This is kind of in a way a lateral extension of that kind of -- instead of tracking a book, you're tracking a person or tracking an eldercare person. So the not that different as you might think if you think of it in that context. But I think ultimately, Jeff, while we will always have this heartland of material signs, I think we will see some movements into these kind of equipment-related businesses. But you're not going to see us getting into sort of a big, giant machines like some of our contemporaries have. This is going to be kind of small, carry with you type stuff on a much smaller scale in those sort of things, but well spotted.\nJeffrey Sprague: And then I was just wondering as the follow-up, if you can help us on the 11% you suggested for next year is kind of a base line given all these deals are kind of closing at different times. What kind of annualized deals impact is included in that 11%?\nPatrick Campbell: Yes. I guess all I'm saying right now, because we still have some more work to do between now and December is we have a couple of points of acquisition-related growth in that 11% number for next year. A piece of that is the deals investment now so there's a small provision for stuff that obviously is currently in the system.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford and Bernstein.\nSteven Winoker: Pat, I know you're going to give all the detail in December on 2011, but on the guidance that you did provide here, should we be adding that to adjusted or GAAP number as we're trying to understand -- think ahead to where would that $0.55 or $0.60 it looks like it's implied on top of.\nPatrick Campbell: Steve, I'd come off of our GAAP numbers when we present our plan, we'll come off of our GAAP numbers.\nSteven Winoker: And then without getting more into detail there, for the quarter, pricing was a 20 basis point headwind, I think and at one point, 440 basis points of that was in Asia Pacific. Am I correct in assuming that was mostly in Optical and Display and Graphics or were you seeing anymore pricing headwinds in any of your other businesses?\nPatrick Campbell: It really remains in the Consumer Electronics space, primarily optimal.\nMatt Ginter: Steve, this is Matt. Just as a reminder, generally speaking, electronics in total for the company is about a one point impact on price in any given year. So really, ex electronics pricing would've been up a little bit for the company.\nSteven Winoker: And then the raw material, 2.5%, was that concentrated in any particular segment?\nPatrick Campbell: Well, first of all, it's more of the U.S. than it is international at this point in time. It's probably more in our industrial-related business at this point in time. But just cutting across most of the businesses but industrial probably has the large piece of it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa of JP Morgan.\nC. Stephen Tusa: Just to be clear on, I guess, the fourth quarter numbers, I think that the performance, the organic performance this quarter was good, it was about in line with kind of the comp would've suggested. But your comp gets a lot tougher in the fourth quarter and you're still really calling for here maybe just a couple of point degradation in the growth rate. Can you talk about which end markets are getting marketing better from a kind of comp perspective? That's going to help you out and I guess just where these new products are layering in the fourth quarter, so where we would expect kind of the best organic performance here in the fourth quarter and then one quick follow up on 2011.\nGeorge Buckley: Well, I think -- obviously, we've talked about some kind of correction in the Display and Graphics business, Steve. And I think we're still going to be carrying forward headwinds on H1N1 so they'll be the tougher comps. All of the businesses were growing very, very rapidly last year and so it's not going to be easy but the forecast from our businesses and our own triangulation suggests you looking at something like, I think an 8% or so growth rate. That's what the number looks like, Steve, that's what the arithmetic shows and so far the arithmetic has carried us forward. I think in the Health Care business, I think it's going to get a little bit easier. It's my guess, I think we've got some stuff, which looks like it's better in that area. So I think that probably will get a little bit better. I don't expect the Industrial businesses to do all that much different. I think we might see just mild betterment in SS&PS as H1 was -- the back end of the fourth quarter was easing a little bit. So I think it's a mixed bag, Steve but all in all, we're comfortable with the projections that we've made.\nPatrick Campbell: And Steve, and remember that if you back into the number that's 8% to 9% range, which of course, if you look at on a year-over-year basis and you look at one of our performance was last year which you're doing, which we had I think of 4% growth last year in the fourth quarter, it is really an improvement in performance. But when you look at kind of where our long-term growth rate wants to be, needs to be, that's consistent with our plan. Electro and Communications continues to run very, very strongly and they'll have a continued very strong fourth quarter here. There's no reason in -- Industrial continued at a double-digit growth here in the fourth quarter. And surprisingly, even Optical being down, it'll still be up on a year-over-year basis. It just won't be as good as it has been in the previous couple of quarters. So all in all, it's a very solid performance across the board.\nC. Stephen Tusa: And then just one follow-up quickly on 2011...\nMatt Ginter: I'm giving you guys the 2011 outlook now.\nC. Stephen Tusa: There's a reason for everything, I guess. The share count number got bumped up, I think year to date, you're looking at something in kind of the 724, 725 range. What's the fourth quarter ending share count in that number?\nGeorge Buckley: So Steve, you  must be talking about your model, the exit rate is about 731.\nC. Stephen Tusa: So that's a headwind next year as well?\nGeorge Buckley: Yes, and what you'll see kind of where through -- we'll give you an assumption as what our share count will be next year when we meet. We just haven't solidified that answer yet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Terry Darling of Goldman Sachs.\nTerry Darling: I wouldn't disappoint you here, Pat, with more 2011. We do appreciate all that. If we look at the balance sheet, net debt to capital, now negative can you, George, talk a little bit how you're thinking about the pace of acquisitions because you've got plenty of firepower here, but presumably valuations are moving up and then maybe, dovetailing off the share count perspective, you clearly would have room to do some buyback as well and where is that in your thinking at this point?\nGeorge Buckley: I think, you can certainly start with your assumption, Terry, that we're going to have an anti-dilution strategy. And we've been trying to figure out finally what our position is going to be on more share buybacks. But I think you are right. We probably will continue at a similar pace on acquisitions next year. There's no reason to believe that it will be significantly off where we are today. Of course, you can't define that exactly at this stage of the game. But I think there is one school of thought here that says we might have done some of our share buybacks next year a little bit above what we've done in the last couple of years. So it's very much in the thinking, Terry, balanced approach. We'll have a higher CapEx number next year, perhaps 30%, maybe even 40% higher than we've had this year. So you open that sort of $1 billion, $3 billion, $4 billion. We've got a lot of demand in Asia, a lot of demand in some of these new market spaces in Abrasives and Renewables Energy area. So we're going to have sort of a balanced need, I think, but I do agree with you, probably it will be some room for a little bit more share buyback next year than perhaps we've crucially done in the last few years.\nTerry Darling: Maybe I'll try to get away with the clarification with this one, but on the 11% revenue growth in '11, couple of points in acquisition, a point on FX, organic implied around 8%, is that fair?\nPatrick Campbell: I will give you more, okay. But you're releasing the rates stage here...\nTerry Darling: 35% incrementals next year flow through. We do obviously across the industrial spectrum see rising raw material prices. Presumably that means you've got to accelerate some of your own price increase activity there. Just talk about your confidence on managing a tougher raw material environment in 2011 around sustaining that 35% flowthrough at this segment profit level.\nGeorge Buckley: Well, first of all, Terry, it's something we have to do. And of course, our first focus will be on driving productivity or gaining class reduction programs. But to the degree that we do need to take out pricing, we will do that. Follow to earlier comment, on raw materials, I think, the steep head was -- it is a little more pocketed. So certain industries will probably have to take some price here. Realistically, you probably lag a little bit to data to surprise increases that we probably maybe should've done a little bit sooner. So we are currently contemplating some additional pricing.\nGeorge Buckley: Some of this is actually happening right now, Terry, so we're on it and I think you're right. I think we're also seeing some easing in some key commodities, not huge easing and not making that prediction, but so a little bit of easing, bolstered by some price that captured close.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citigroup.\nDeane Dray: So it sounds as though the 2011 framework puts you at or above that longer-term 7% to 8% organic revenue growth goal. So I was hoping, George, can you comment on some of these recent moves that move you along that target? And just with regard to Alpha Beta, how that is this the pyramid, new product introductions of now the Index and now 34% of revenues from emerging markets. All of this moves you towards this goal, should we expect more of the same or is there further initiative?\nGeorge Buckley: No, I think, we like the pathway we're going down, Deanae, and you correctly interpreted pretty much all of what we're doing, driving the top line innovation that's why mentioned that 32% MPBI number. That's important. That will keep on filling the sort of the top of the hopper. Our improvement strategy, of which Alpha Beta is part of, helps us bulwark some of the leakage that might come. So that's an important part of the puzzle. You're right about our emphasis on emerging markets, completely correct and also, you'll see some of the acquisitions Deane, Attenti, Cogent in much higher growth spaces than traditionally have been the case with 3M. So we're playing all the sort of the strings on the fiddle and so far, the music is coming out okay. I'm sure here and there, things won't turn out exactly as we hope, but I think the last piece of the puzzle, Deane, not the necessarily and on any kind of negative note is we've got to start trying to put more of the magic on I think on our U.S. business, on our Western European businesses, but with the kind of capabilities that we have, I mean, when you think comparing us, left, right versus many of our competitors, you wonder how ultimately we are not going to win that battle. So I think it's now just a question of emphasizing those a little bit more and that might give us yet some more lift in due course. So I think you've already -- you've outlined the plan and the data right on. I don't think it's going to change a great deal, Deane.\nDeane Dray: And just a follow-up, the comment on Cogent, I mean you're already in a passport security system. What else does Cogent add in terms of a security platform?\nGeorge Buckley: Well, they're primarily border crossing, border-security type applications so they're all high-security military, embassies, those sort of things where you need high-security entry. So they're in the classic fingerprint areas and remembering that the only thing that a criminal leaves at a crime site is a fingerprint, it's still very important to local law enforcements, so that's still important. But you get up in the level of sophistication, iris scanning, palm scanning, those sort of things are kind of part and parcel of the secular move toward much more secured border crossing environment, with smarter passports, smarter, should we say biometric interrogation of people passing the border, so I think this is just a steady move up the technology space for us and into higher growth spaces, Deane.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Begleiter: George, this is now your fourth quarter in a row of above market growth. Do you think you're gaining credit for that in the market? And if not, what will it take to get credit for this above market growth code that you've perhaps cracked here?\nGeorge Buckley: Well, I think, Dave, obviously we want the same thing that you do. I think understandably, investors want to see a track record. They're, I'm sure, very pleased with how it's gone so far, but I think ultimately, I've kind of viewed another couple of quarters, maybe we'll get to the tipping point of people's opinion, but it's still a lot of work to be done before them. We've got to continue to work at this. Host the stuff that we know, we know how to do the innovation, we know how to do the customer engagement and so maybe we're not getting quite the full credit for it yet, but I think it's no time to be impatient. At least not for us, we keep on doing what we do well and I have every confidence that it'll come our way in due course, David. But thank you for the implied help there.\nDavid Begleiter: And Pat, just in 2011, why the higher tax rate and will acquisitions be dilutive to 2011 EPS?\nPatrick Campbell: First of all, acquisitions will be -- when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, the changing guidance that we've had in 2010 here, acquisitions will actually be a little bit accretive for us on getting a year-over-year basis, slightly. Tax rate at this point in time, our planning standpoint, our structural rate is more around 30% right now. So that's what we'll probably put in our plan for next year. Our long-term goal is 28.5% and keep driving that down. We are able to pull some things off this year that were more kind of one time in nature and obviously, the tax seems still has an assignment for next year to keep finding those things, but it's probably prudent at this point in time to probably plan around a 30% rate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts from Buckingham Research.\nJohn Roberts: Do you think the correction in the display marketplace will flush through in the quarter or do you think it could be something that can linger into early 2011?\nGeorge Buckley: Well, you never really know. Depends on how sellthrough goes in the Christmas season is the answer to that question. But I'll try to address it. I think the vast majority of any image correction must be true. This is an industry with about six weeks inventory in the channel and their ability to flush you through is very rapid. So you kind of see these things that short and sharp. They drop fast, they come back fast. If history has anything to teach us, I think that you'll see the first quarter, once the correction has gone through, you'll see the first quarter accompanied by some more rapid growth or return to rapid growth. But also traditionally, it's usually associated with this is some extra pricing pressure, as the OEMs try to use that as means of just short of bulldozing their way through. They just basically -- they don't like volumes dropping and one of the games they play, one of the tools they use to push through. So I think that's the sort of environment that you'll see. And so I think that will ease as the first quarter goes through, maybe the second quarter. So that's kind of the pattern, short, sharp, fully fixed in the fourth quarter depending on sell through probably surface and some pricing pressure in the first half of the year and higher volumes. That's probably the way this thing is going to pan out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies & Company.\nLucy Watson: Good morning, this is Lucy Watson on for Lawrence today. Just wanted to ask, it sounds like about 40 to 50 basis points is the gross margin contraction this quarter was due to unfavorable mix. And I'm wondering if we should be taking in something around that range of unfavorable mix going forward? [indiscernible].\nGeorge Buckley: Yes, Lucy, it depends on what period of time you're thinking off is a piece of that is raw materials. We think we're going through kind of the peak of that right now. That actually should kind of structure declined and we think a little bit. Another piece of this of course is the mix of the business that we have between Health Care and Safety kind of being down. The H1N1 piece will obviously will last us for another quarter. So that impact will still be there. But we do expect Health Care will perform better in the fourth quarter than they did in the third quarter. So maybe, on a little bit -- but I don't think the same degree of reduction, Lucy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal from FBR Capital Markets.\nAjay Kejriwal: Just wanted to follow up on your comment on D&G and pricing in the first half next year. So some pressure there, but then would be interested in your thoughts on volume and the trends you're seeing with LED penetration and then expectations for large LCD TVs growth rates going into next year?\nGeorge Buckley: Well, I think you'll probably see some mix shifts as when there's any sense of market pressure, these manufacturers try fishing in different ponds to see where they can catch a big crunch of customers. So that's where I think the pricing mix will sort of pan out. We'll see and probably experiments in lower brightness, experiments maybe without films, experiments with fewer LEDs and a few things like that. But I think ultimately, I mean in the past, those things are not worthwhile to be completely honest with you and the customer's being unwilling really on a consistent basis, accept those. So I suspect that once the flushing has gone through the channel, it will return to more normalized basis. But I think it's -- there's been a fairly sizable gap between the standard CCFL TVs and the LED TVs. I suspect that gap, that will compress. And so they'll use that obviously to drive I think volume at the top of the performance pyramid. So a lot of kind of I suspect, turbulence even in the fourth quarter but certainly going over into the first quarter until they find a new mix of sales, brightness, sizes that seems to suit current market conditions. So some turbulence, probably putting pressures on price but volume coming back would be my prediction.\nPatrick Campbell: Yes. We still expect flat panel TVs will still be a strong double digit. LED I think was you're kind of -- you've got a specific question on LED, the industry probably will run 20%, 25% this year. That number should be about to 2x probably in 2011 if we're probably approaching 50%. So obviously, that's a favorable mix shift for us.\nAjay Kejriwal: And just on that 30% increase in adding merchandising spend, clearly investing to push growth here. Maybe insight into how these expenses crack over the next few quarters and then the expectation on the payback?\nPatrick Campbell: Let's say it kind of continues investments so it's not necessarily lumpy once we have as a good and the base will keep going. It's a little bit -- it adds up somewhat seasonal related, especially in the Consumer business. But our tracking is -- we have a very good tracking mechanism as to what we invest versus are we getting the sales back and it's driven by business but it's a long-term -- it's investment for us, both in the developed part of the world if you at all are a TV watcher, you've seen far more TV ads as well as online ads here in the U.S. But importantly, we're also investing a fair amount in the emerging markets. Now is the time to be investing in our brands in emerging markets and in some cases, that will not pay back immediately. Some of this is a longer-term payback and some of those emerging markets.\nOperator: And our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Stephen Tusa from JP Morgan.\nC. Stephen Tusa: Just on the first half for next year, you talked about Display and Graphics getting better, I think the fourth quarter. Is there anything going on with the comps that are going to make kind of growth uneven as you look out to next year for the D&G or any other businesses?\nGeorge Buckley: Stephen, we haven't completely quarterized next year, okay? But nothing that comes necessarily to my mind. You look at -- there still was a little bit of H1N1 rollover into the first half of this year. So Safety has a little bit probably a tougher comp early in the year versus late in the year. Other than that, I don't see, I think, that is kind of materially different on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\nPatrick Campbell: Steve, I think H1N1 was in the neighborhood of $40 million to $50 million in the first quarter of 2010.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for closing comments.\nGeorge Buckley: Thanks, everybody, for attending and we look forward to seeing you on December 7.\nPatrick Campbell: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines."}, {"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 2, "year": 2010, "date": "2010-07-22 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nMatt Ginter: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter business review. For those of you that attended our Investor Meeting in Kentucky last month, we hope you found it helpful in understanding our company further. Also, as I've mentioned on the past two calls, please mark your calendars for the morning of Tuesday, December 7, when we'll host our Annual Outlook Meeting in New York City. Complete details regarding timing and location will be available very soon. Before we begin, take a moment please to read the forward-looking statement on Slide #2. During today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of our most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. So let's begin the review, I'll turn the program over to George, and please turn to Slide #3.\nGeorge Buckley: Thank you very much, Matt, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us on our second quarter call. As you see, it was another outstanding quarter for us in both revenue and earnings as we essentially repeated and built upon the success patterns of recent quarters. In fact, sales of $6.7 billion matched our previous all-time quarterly record set in 2008. And coming off the depths, the recent recession, I think this is a remarkable achievement by 3M's people, holding one year after such a terrible economic contraction. We once again delivered tremendous organic volume growth 18% this time, to the twice the rate of global IPI. While it's difficult to determine accurate and the exact sources of growth, the strong economy was certainly a factor and as we explained, last quarter, we continue to take market share and create new markets with the high level of new product vitality. It's opening many old and many new customer doors for us. As we've done throughout the downturn, we continued to invest in and build for the future. In Q2, we took a major step forward, increasing advertising and promotions by nearly 30%, mostly in consumer and increased R&D spending by 13%. I think this speaks directly to the strength of the 3M model and that we were able to generate very high-quality results even as we invest and build the future success. Second quarter record operating was $1.6 billion, up 34% on last year. I'm especially pleased with our margin performance at 23.7%, with all businesses achieving 22% or better margins. The corresponding EPS of $1.54 per share is 38% increase year-over-year. Now let me take you quickly through the business highlights. Please turn to Slide #4. In our largest business, Industrial and Transportation, sales were up 23% and leveraging was outstanding with profits of 66%. Within that segment, our newest division, Renewable Energy, was up 73% of sales, coming up of 72% increase in the first quarter. FYI, we built a brand new coating line for this business in Singapore last September, which very quickly sold out. So we'll be expecting capacity again in the most of the come. Also of note, is that our Automotive OEM sales were also up nearly 50%. This compares to global auto build in the mid-20%. And Abrasives, our oldest business, was up an impressive 28%. Health Care sales rose 5% in dollars or about 6% in local currency terms. H1N1 was about a point drag on health care growth. The stars in Health Care were drug delivery systems, which is creating double-digit growth, largely from new products. Dental care sales were up 7% in local currency and our core Skin and Wound Care business grew at a similar rate. Health Care profits increase in line with sales, reflecting increase investment levels, even both with those investments, margins were very spiffy at 31%. Display and Graphics continued on its impressive growth and profit trajectory, with a 30% sales jumping profit up 69%. Optical systems again led the way, with a 64% sales increase, driven almost entirely by new products. Our technology is in the sweet spot of need as LCD TVs migrated to LED backlights. Another star was our Commercial Graphics business. In 2009, it was impacted greatly by the downturn and is now on an upswing. With second quarter sales up 22% year-on-year and 12% sequentially. This is especially encouraging more generally since in our experience, Commercial Graphics is usually a property for future business renewal and advertising spend. Consumer and Office sales rose 10%, with organic growth accounting for the half the increase. Acquisitions were also a significant driver, with the addition of ACE Bandages in the retail health care space and A-One in the Asian retail level market. Consumer and Office is another investment story as we're having sales and marketing resources, especially internationally, and addition to the add merch investments I mentioned earlier. Profits rose 7%, with margins in a healthy 22%, very good for Consumer business in these unusual times. Safety, Security and Protection Services grew sales 10%, a great result even as H1N1-related respiratory sales naturally tapered off as that crisis passed. We estimate that H1N1 added about $18 million sales to the second quarter results in comparison a year ago, the H1N1 sales totaled $50 million. So the drag on Q2 growth for the total company was about 0.6%. Security systems posted growth of over 30% and both Industrial Mineral Products and building commercial services drove double-digit sales increases. Profits in SSPS rose 9% and margins were maintained north of 23%. Last, but certainly not least, Electro and Communications sales rose 32%, while profits rose a whopping 150% and margins approached 23%. Consumer electronics is the story here as our business is serving the electronics market grew over 60%. Using logic chipset sales as a proxy, the industry was up 34%. You might logically ask why we're growing so much faster than the market. The answer again is new products like our Optically Clear Adhesives, a new market share as increasingly same components are being specified into a number of leading electronic handheld devices. Growth wasn't limited to electronics though, as Electrical Markets division, which is utility, MRO and construction-oriented division, sales grew by 17% year-over-year and nearly 10% sequentially. So in summary, with another terrific quarter, with some real eye-popping results. Some of the others have said that as a practical matter, investors are not interested today in anybody's second quarter news or their results, only what they see is a very uncertain future. We certainly understand and sympathize with the basis of that view. So in that vein, let me try to answer two principal questions for you today. The first is, what are we seeing in economies around the world that might indicate where these markets are headed in the coming quarters? And the second question is, what progress is 3M making toward our goal of more or less doubling our natural organic growth rates? And hopefully, I mean, a target north of 7% growth if IPI is in its normal historical balance of 3% to 3.5%. Just remind ourselves that for the second quarter now behind us, we have seen the end of arithmetically easy year-on-year growth comparisons. It's now going to get a lot harder for everyone, not just 3M, from here on in. We made that simple observation at the beginning of the year on our fourth quarter '09 conference call, where it seems to have been misunderstood here and there. We were never speaking about the innate growth capability of the company, only a simple exercise in year-over-year arithmetic. So turning to the world economies. The pattern of end market demand we're seeing has remained very positive overall. These are the things you'd expect to see happening as an interesting positive twists and turns. Asia and Latin America will be no surprise to you and that they remain very strong. Before anybody infers that this was just the law of averages, working across several months in many countries, let me give you a little bit of extra data. China as a proxy for Asia rose 51% in the quarter and 45% in the month of June, and Korea grew 68% in the quarter. Brazil rose a comparable 50% in the quarter and 42% in June. Europe was quite strong for us also with local currency growth coming in at 11% for the quarter and 11% in June as well. For context, please remember that the recovery had already begun for us in June of 2009. There was some mild softness in Spain and Greece, with sales flat for the quarter as you expect. But we see no signs of contingent in our numbers. A few small Eastern European countries fitted that same pattern. The sales in June showed good recovery in trends. FYI, Greece, Spain and Portugal combined make up only 1.5% of our total sales therefore, not a large factor for us. Even if you market as whole showed gains of 38%. You can see now why we have such a focus on our international strategy when you consider the emerging markets now account for fully 1/3 of all 3M sales. It was EMEA, five years ago, the emerging markets comprised only a quarter of our sales, up significantly smaller base. For the quarter, the big European economy is running two different speed lanes. Germany was in the Autobahn-style super-fast league at more than 20% local currency growth in the quarter and 27% in June, which more than made up for any slowness elsewhere in Europe. Germany's IP on the quarter was estimated to be 9%, so we grew at about 3x the market in Germany. Italy, France and the U.K. were all in the cruise lane at about 5% to 6%. You can imagine what happened in these countries from here on in will be highly variable for market-to-market, affected by a combination of the presence, or lack of, local stimulus, funds, foreign exchange rates. China especially is impacted here. And whether the end markets our local consumer led were more export oriented in what rates they were recovering at. We really don't have the time to go over each of them one by one. Export lead manufacturing economy like Germany, Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan, all effectively remain robust at this time. So overall, we remain cautiously optimistic and think the risk of a second economic collapse is small. That said, when stimulus funds ran out. We must expect the collective end market demand in those economies to taper off, accentuated by the more challenging arithmetic of year-over-year comparisons. Underlying market growth is slowly increasing in both markets, perhaps not at the same date as stimulus funds could dry up, depending on local policy execution. U.S. is trying to feather in that change to avoid a sharp decline in demand. The outcome is that there will be possibly a period of slower growth beginning in end markets later this year, perhaps late Q3 or early Q4. This is in the double dip per se, it's just a soft spot and very normal as economic growth takes a breather for a while, and adjust to new circumstances such as higher interest rates, lower stimulus or commodity inflation. All are very normal in my view. We get one in every recovery, and I think the fact here to build is that companies who innovate well can beat this trap. The unknown factor, one is very hard to assess with any position, is the one that certainly impact the debt levels in Europe. If all the nations in Europe address this problem systematically and simultaneously then growth will inevitably ease. Reports suggest this factor could reduce eurozone GDP by 1% to 1.5%. In my experience, cost-reduction programs are always less successful than they were in tension plan. To my mind, as long as they're breaking up on an overly [ph] hard, slow economic growth is certainly better than sovereign debt defaults and bodes well for a better future as default risk falls. And as always, we as a company keep innovating and differentiating, this mild slowing is not necessarily negative for 3M. After all, we show we can comfortably overcome a small 1% GDP reduction in a few countries. It's relative competitive advantage that counts. I maintain my view that, if you shake the bottle, the cream always come back to the top of the milk. In the U.S., the key to improve long-term growth remains unemployment and investment. Candidly speaking, the U.S. government wanted to help the situation, it will be finding ways to encourage investment in manufacturing and not having more entitlement programs. In my view, prosperity is the best way to ensure security in any nation and to any company. U.S. employment is moving forward a bit, even if it's at a stalagmite pace. Productivity for us in many other companies is outpacing both inflation and GDP growth, and that means two things. One, margin trends will be good; and two, apart from new technology areas, overall, hiring will likely be low. For those companies who have the capability to differentiate, innovate and thoughtfully invest in new, as well as core markets, I think the environment can be pretty good. And in a perverse twist of irony, it offers real competitive advantage to innovators like 3M. This is simply a process of Darwinian Economics at work. Turning to 3M's growth capability. We see trends for three or four quarters, which suggest that we might be close to cracking the growth cord, and the paths we're close to the tipping point, that we've long been in search of. So when would we know this for certain? I feel a little bit like an economist now by saying that to be definitive, we need more data. Q3 and Q4 are going to be very important in the quest as the world economy cools a bit and any inventory transcends to the extent that they ever existed died down. It's at this point of the share and market creation data will become much clearer. But tipping point or not, all in all, we seem to be making  meaningful progress toward our long-term growth objective. I think this is completely logical to believe as our NPVI number goes up. We should expect that it translates into more growth, either through market creation are share gain. If it doesn't, then why bother? What is unknown and probably unknowable is whether the share gains we made a sustainable or just a one-time function of economic recovery. The important factor is the improving implicit quality of the products under the umbrella of that NPVI number. With more platform products being released than ever and a greater percentage of longer live products, the overall trend is very positive and we plan to show you more of the data behind it in our year-end update in December. To summarize, our microeconomic views that played out more or less as we expected, confirming there are plan of wars and still is the right plan. To speak candidly, we believe we can deliver superior performance whatever economic scenario unfolds, good or bad, and we're not afraid of it. We clearly demonstrated our ability to generate growth and leverage earnings, while always keeping our eyes in investment on the longer-term price of much higher growth. What's clear is that we have tremendous momentum in our favor. With 18% organic volume growth in Q2, which is well in excess of the market growth. For three quarters in a row now, we have generated net growth of about 8% to 9% above the market. We all know how fickle these things can be, but this is clearly much more than a one quarter flashing the path adjustment. In fact, we've outpace economic growth by a large margin for nearly a year. If we can do this again in the next couple of quarters, I think we should all conclude that growth point has been proven. I can't, however, promise you a monotonically  increasing pattern. The road to growth often has a few bumps on it. We also have to closely watch demand and have the confidence to investing capacity just a little bit ahead of it. Otherwise, we'll startle growth as capacity not demand becomes a new choke point. 3M's people have proven to simultaneously do acquisitions, invest heavily in the long term, drive R&D productivity and service low part of the trepid without margin collapse. If the growth point gets proven in this next couple of quarter, and if I were in your shoes, I'd soon be asking the next question, how much more money can you put to work and repeat the trick. So with that, let me address our outlook for the year. Please turn to Chart #5. Very strong second quarter behind us and great forward momentum, we are raising our full year 2010 expectations for the third consecutive quarter. We now believe the organic sales volume will come in between 13% and 15% for the year versus a prior forecast of 10% to 12%. We also expect that earnings per share will fall somewhere within the band of $5.65 and $5.80 on an adjusted basis versus a prior expectation of $5.40 to $5.60. We anticipate that our operating margins will be above 22.5% for the year, up a point higher than our previously expected numbers. Our tax rate and share count are unchanged versus last quarter. I hope this kind of call helps you, and I'll now turn over the call to Pat to explain our second quarter results in more detail.\nPatrick Campbell: Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide #6. On a year-over-year basis, sales rose 18% in the second quarter to $6.7 billion, and importantly equaled the previous peak sales level from the second quarter of 2008. Growth was led by Asia Pacific at 42% and Latin America and 23%. We saw tremendous growth in some sales through some of our large and important business and industries, including 61% in  the Electronics and 49% in Automotive OEM. As George mentioned, we grew much faster than the underlying market in both of these cases. As in the first quarter, organic volume drove up our results in the second. Organic volume rose 18% worldwide, with increases of 38% in Asia Pacific, 22% in Latin America, 11% in Europe and 9% in the United States. Acquisitions there is 70 basis points of growth versus the second quarter of 2009, primarily attributable to the recent purchases of ACE products, home of one of the great consumer health care brands, and A-One labels, the second-largest retail and office label producer in the world. Both of these transactions are on track to deliver in 2010 and well beyond. Selling prices declined at 60 basis points in the quarter, a bottom line with our plan entering the year. The decline was largely due to normal price down trends within our Electronics businesses. Gross profit grew 20% year-on-year and gross margins rose just over a point to 49%. Strong volume growth certainly boosted gross margins, in fact, utilization rates were very good in the quarter. We also experienced carryover benefits from restructuring actions undertaken in 2009. These gains more than offset some modest pricing headwinds, both in terms of selling prices, which declines 60 basis points and raw materials, which increased just over 3% year-on-year on a gross basis. We fully anticipated this in our plan for the year. Looking ahead, we expect raw materials to be slight headwind again in the third quarter, but caution likely you flatten out in the fourth. Finally, we saw a significant improvements in yield, waste, speed and productivity, driven heavily by 3M's many Lean Six Sigma teams around the globe. SG&A cost increased 9%, which included a 15% increase in sales and marketing investments. We continue to invest in advertising and promotion, which is up nearly 30% on a year-on-year basis, as well as sales reps and new marketing talent, particularly in high-growth developing economies. R&D investments rose $41 million or 13% to $350 million for the quarter. And once again, general and administration costs remained under very good cost control. Operating income rose 34% to $1.6 billion, a record for any second quarter in 3M's history and margins surge nearly three points to 23.7%. The second quarter tax rate was 26.6%, down about four points on a year-on-year basis due to a lower international tax rate, along with a resolution of a number of U.S. federal tax audits. We continue to expect full year tax rate to be about 28% or lower, which would imply a 29% rate in the back half of the year, with a third quarter slightly higher than the fourth. On a GAAP-reported basis, we generated record second quarter earnings of $1.54 per share, up 38% year-on-year. Please turn to Slide 7 for a look at our sequential P&L results. Sales rose 6% sequentially, despite approximately 2% points of currency pressure. So in fact, underlying volumes rose nicely versus the first quarter. Sequential growth was broad-based as five of our six businesses posted improvements and the other, namely Health Care, generated sales were about the same level as Q1. So the company overall continues to improve and expand quarter-by-quarter. In a subsegment level, there are many sequential sales highlights, but I'll hit just a few of them. Optical films posted impressive quarter-on-quarter growth of nearly 30% as customer production levels rose in anticipation of a good year of sales for LCD TVs and other electronic devices. Other notable increases include Traffic Safety Systems, Industrial Tapes and Adhesives and Automotive Aftermarket solutions. Our retail DIY business also posted a very impressive sequential sales gains, boosted by a continuous flow of great new products such as the new-generation Scotch-Blue Painter's Tape and Filtrete home Furnace Filters. Gross profit increase in line with sales and gross margins were a solid 49%. Back throughput in the second quarter was similar to Q1 levels and raw materials slightly higher on a sequential basis, but we managed to match Q1's gross margin percent regardless. Gross profit was boosted by ongoing productivity efforts, which continued to play a critical role in our future strategy. Future growth investments, demands continues to improvement throughout our businesses. SG&A and R&D investments, both rose 2% sequentially. Recall the stock option expense is the highest in the first quarter, commensurate with when we grant options to our employees. Adjusting for this SG&A and R&D, both increased over 5% on a sequential basis. Operating income increased 10% versus Q1, and incremental profits rose 40%. Operating margins were up nearly a full point versus the first quarter to 23.7%. Net income and earnings per share increased 20% and 19% respectively. Now let's turn to the balance sheet and cash flow. Please turn to Slide #8. Free cash flow for the first six months of 2010 was $1.9 billion, a year-on-year increase of over 10%, and we converted 92% of net income to free cash flow over the period. Slightly lower capital expenditures accounted for most of the difference. We anticipate that capital investments will begin to accelerate in the second half of 2010, as a number of our key product lines are at or near full capacity. We expect to invest approximately $1 billion on CapEx in 2010, and early forecast indicate that 2011 could be up 25% to 30%. These additional investments are mostly for growth-related investments. For the full year 2010, we are forecasting the free cash flow conversion will be right around 100%. Acquisition activity was light in the first half of the year, but we expect to increase our acquisition activity in the second half, with a number of good opportunities in the Hopper. Now working capital turns were 5.4 at quarter end, an improvement versus 5.3 last quarter and 4.8 one year ago. Accounts receivable turns were 7.2 versus 6.6 one year ago, and receivable balances are up only 8% year-on-year versus an 18% sales increase. So receivables are in very good shape. Inventories rose 15% year-on-year, again less than the rate of sales growth, and turns were 4.4 in June versus 4.3 one year ago. We certainly are not satisfied at these inventory levels, but considering the rapid ramp up in demand over the past two quarters along with tight supply in some raw materials, it was good to see continued forward progress in our turns. Overall, our working capital is in good shape, and we're well positioned for future growth. Cash return to shareholders totaled $748 million in the second quarter, roughly double the amount paid in both the first quarter of 2010 and the second quarter of 2009. We resume share repurchases in Q2 after a few quarters without, and we expect to continue buying additional shares during the remainder of the year. To quickly summarize, the second quarter was another very good one for 3M. We drove strong growth and outstanding bottom line leverage even with significant investments to continue driving higher future growth. We raised our earnings of guidance from a previous level of $5.40 to $5.60, to $5.65 to $5.80 per share, and we expect that organic sales volume growth will be in the range of 13% to 15% for the whole year, three points higher than our previous expectation. Operating margins should be north of 22.5% for the year, and we're anticipating a tax rate at or below 28% assuming no change of course to current tax laws. Finally, our balance sheet is in great shape and puts us in a strong position given uncertainty about the shape of the recovery. Regardless of how the economy shakes out, we'll remain focused on outrunning our competitors in delivering superior financial results. That concludes the formal portion of today's call conference call, so let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Morgan Stanley.\nScott Davis: Across the board, things were, obviously, very, very strong, I think with the exception of Health Care, which was kind of -- which I suppose is somewhat tougher comps because that business was pretty strong last year. I guess my question is kind of what are you seeing in that business because it was a little slow, at Dental here as well. Is there across the board some destocking going on in Dental? Is there -- is it just a function of kind of tougher comps? Just a little bit more color, I guess, is what I'm asking.\nPatrick Campbell: Let me take it and then George can -- actually, they performed at basically their historical growth rate  give or take a point. You do have to recall that they did have some favorable impact of H1N1 in the second quarter of last year, Scott, probably to the tune of a point, point and a half of sales that didn't repeat here in the second quarter. But we feel very, very positive about the progress of that business. And a lot of it is, they did not fall off as much nearly as many of the other businesses. Our Oral Care business, as George said, was up 7%. So we had very good results there. So we really have no concerns within our Health Care business relative to the growth.\nGeorge Buckley: The two businesses that saw that kind of maintained, I mean, they compressed a little bit, Scott, but maintained kind of normal performance versus the Consumer and Office business and Health Care. And you're just really seeing some small debts from them last year and comparable smaller growth issues. So it's really arithmetic issue. It just measures the stability in Oral businesses rather than anything to worry about.\nScott Davis: The other thing, price down 0.6%. I think that's first quarter. We've seen kind of price turn negative. I know, obviously, we've got some -- the Display and Graphics is always kind of a negative price curve. But is there any kind of reason why prices came down? Because, I mean, most of your main commodities, I believe, in the first half of the year were probably a little bit higher.\nPatrick Campbell: I guess no particular reasons, Scott. As you point out, the electronics is the fundamental, the structural piece of the price down. I think it's fair to say that if you'd ask the question, did we give up some price to maintain volume and so forth. When you look at our volume levels, I think it would be fair to say that there's probably some price, okay, that we're trading off to get some volume. But that's not a big concern for us. The businesses who have material cost increases are well aware of it, and they managed the relative position of price to cost very well as you can see in our overall margin results.\nGeorge Buckley: I think, Scott, there are some pricing opportunities that we might be able to grab now. And also, when you think about the very high mix of electronic volumes and sales, it kind of distorts the net pricing picture. So again, I don't think there's anything for you to be concerned about. But it looks like there might be a little bit of opportunity here and there.\nScott Davis: And just quickly, I just wanted to get a chance, and I know it's a little early in the year to start talking about pension. But just to try to make sure we get our models right for next year, if we had to mark-to-market where we're at with discount rates, where do you think that would be for next year?\nPatrick Campbell: Well, Scott, let me first of all try to address kind of the broader issue. We have a very, very solid balance sheet. I don't lay awake at night worrying about kind of our pension plan from a funding status. You kind of asked a question probably more of an EPS. And I think it's important that you, as well as investors, kind of make sure that they would differentiate between EPS and kind of what the cash flow impact is going to be for a number of us who face a little bit of a headwind situation. But let me just try to, I guess, table set where we're at. Going into the year, we had a carry over amortization issue of probably in the order of about $200 million. So if you use tail end of last year's assumptions, and for our U.S. plan, that would have been an 8.5% ROE and 5.77% discount rate. That effectively left us in a situation that going into 2011, assuming those results affected, we would have about a $200 million headwind. If you then look forward, and I'm not going to give you a specific number, but I'll give you some sensitivities that you can look at, because obviously, we only measure this come year end. It's one of these things where you only measure it at one point in time during the year. But for every 25 basis point change in the discount rate, it impacts our pretax by about $28 million, and every point of return on assets is about $6 million. So hopefully that kind of helps you. From a modeling standpoint, you can look at kind of your own set of assumptions. It's of course here at the end of the second quarter. We entered an environment where discount rates have really come down very, very significantly. I would not look at that as a realistic point from a funding perspective, because I think most of us will probably believe that interest rates are going to have to ratchet up in the future. So it's just a matter of when we start to see that happen.  And I think we're all hoping of course that the equity markets have a little more of a back half rally to it. I think we'd all like to see that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from Sanford Bernstein.\nSteven Winoker: First question around -- again, you talked a lot about, again, breaking up that top line core volume growth and talked about what is implied in sort of what must be share gains from new product discussions, et cetera. But how are you still seeing that restocking part of it playing out? I mean, as you now reflect back on the quarter, what's your sense in terms of total restocking? I know you just talked about dental a little bit, but just total restocking across the business.\nGeorge Buckley: Well, Steve, it's really not that high to be frank with you. We pull our people here, and they really say there's just not a lot. In fact, if you look at the Census Bureau data, it shows that there's a little bit maybe more destocking than there is restocking net-net. So I don't think that's a big factor. We tried to calculate what impact was in the first quarter because we have those in monster numbers. And we cranked in three into the number, it might have been a little bit high. So I don't think it's a big factor at all, Steve. Maybe it's 1%, if you want to sort of put a number on the total this quarter. It's certainly not more than two, it's certainly less than the last quarter. So I don't think that's what's driving it, Steve. It seems to be when you look at the market growth, and you subtract all of the other things you know, you're left with this sort of 8% or 9% of growth that you can only attribute to in a share gain or on a new market creation. And that's been the pattern that's existed for three or four quarters now. And of course, you can probably understand we intend to try to do our level best to repeat it. And so it does seem that the new product growth model seems to be working, Steve, and I don't think that it's a big piece of this is being driven by restructuring. Remember, a lot of the channels that we have, have no stocking. Automotive has no stocking points. Electronics has no stocking points. We don't really send a lot through channels that do. So I don't think it's a big deal, Steve.\nSteven Winoker: For the second half of the year, as you look to that organic growth number that you've described, again, that's still dependent mostly on new product introductions and market share gains versus the cyclical rebound. Is that fair to say or...\nPatrick Campbell: Yes, Steve, I would say that we're not anticipating that, I'll call it the restocking side, okay, is the reason for the back-half growth. It really is our fundamental performance in the back half of the year. I guess I'll just add to George's comment as he says, it's a little bit of a tricky question, okay, on restocking because when you're selling to OEMs and electronics and auto and the like, is we don't think there's restocking going on. Of course, until the point in time that, obviously, they overbilled, okay. And then there's some point in time they may have the excess inventory in that to adjust production schedules down. But it's very interesting that a lot of supply chains across the globe are very, very tight today just to meet existing schedules. So I don't think there's been a lot of room for people necessarily to build a lot more inventory back in the system. Plus, and let's face it, coming out of the recession, people are just more and more cautious about kind of a little bit of last minute ordering still, and they are waiting until -- and actually trying to tighten up the supply chain even more and pushing some of that back into the suppliers.\nGeorge Buckley: Steve, there's another phenomena that we've heard about, and that is in the electronics area. There is some double ordering. Because the supply chains are so tight, so lean, and some customers are worried about being able to get products, we do hear some occasional tales of double ordering. And of course, in the end, it's he who has the service quality, he who has the inventory is going to get that business. So you've got some kind of weird conditions existing in some of the businesses. So in part, I think it's not a big factor as we see it at the moment.\nSteven Winoker: And could you maybe expand on the sort of incremental margins in Consumer and Office and Safety over the last quarter? Just struck me on the incremental side a bit low, but just peeling that apart a little bit.\nPatrick Campbell: Yes, in both of those businesses, you just have to  be a little cautious, Steve, because of the sell into distribution and when we promote products. Generally speaking, in the first quarter and the consumers specifically, we don't spend a lot of money in average sales and promotion. But that starts to kick up here in Q2 and then through the rest of the year. If you look at those margins in that business though, you just kind of -- I still think that we're leading margins in about any Consumer business. So I look at that business really more from a standpoint of are we investing in it enough and really helping the retailers sell through the products that we have. So I think it's more of a timing of expense issue than it really is any kind of an incremental. So if you look at it over a trend basis, Steve, in kind of an annual basis or longer-term basis, they should have somewhere incremental margins. But you just have to be a little cautious on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\nGeorge Buckley: Only one last piece of color, Steve. We did decide to fund some projects on more advertising and merchandising and feet on the street in some of these emerging markets. There just seemed wonderful opportunities to us. So we did make some of that spending in this quarter. So again, I think you should see, as long as you understand the reasons behind the question or behind the data, you'll feel more reassured. Because actually the positive, we were investing in growth not suffering some sort of price compression or difficulties in the business. It was completely the opposite.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners.\nJeffrey Sprague: George, back to your kind of maybe closing thought before you tossed it to Pat on if you haven't cracked the code, how do you deploy capital to further capitalize on it. Obviously, R&D is lagging sales, not really from lack of wanting to spend R&D but the sales are just so darn strong. But I wonder if you look at the balance between R&D and capital, how you think things play out going forward. I think you've done a lot of work untangling the hairball as you used to call it. But you do have a lot of new products in the pipeline. Is the growth challenge there actually just getting the capital on place to deliver them? Or do you actually feel like you get the need to continue to really prime that pump more to drive the top line?\nGeorge Buckley: We talked about this. If you look at that roughly 30% or 31% NPVI number where we're at right now, and we really haven't lowered a lot more people in the system. It's a similar number to what existed when it was down in the low 20s and the late teens, and then clearly have -- we've driven some real good productivity in our R&D. Now you say, to ease off the question, how much more can we get out of productivity and how much do we need to put in real money on spend. You have to think of a couple of things there. One is just the basic kind of administration burden in R&D. Secondly, as Pat makes the point, we still got loads and loads of growth opportunities in emerging markets which are generally less expensive. So my kind of feeling on the R&D spend is, yes, it probably has to go up a little bit if we're going to continue to accelerate that 30, 31 number of the 40 which is what really is our goal. On the capital, I think the kind of growth rates we've been seeing in some of these businesses, in Optically Clear Adhesives, in Optical Films, in Abrasives, in the Renewable Energy in those areas, we have really just loaded those factories up. And I think, I only say it on the call because I think we remind it to ourselves as well as to investors that there is another piece to this puzzle, that we have to have capacity to do it. So I think right now, we seem to have gotten the R&D net-net. I think we got the R&D thing run pretty well, Jeff. And here and there, we are just going to have to pay increasing amounts of attention to investments in those big businesses. We have talked to investors about increasing the capital spend to the year probably taking up by maybe another $100 million, maybe turn up to $120 million, but something in that order in response to the question really that you're asking. I think we're okay for now. I think we have the people to execute it, Jeff. But if we continue to get these kind of growth rates for a long time, clearly, we're going to have to put some more people in here and get some more infrastructure to execute to make sure it's all kept in balance.\nJeffrey Sprague: And then I'm just wondering to get in the weeds a little bit on consumer, the organic growth was a touch lower than I was guessing. Was there any channel fill from kind of the label initiative or is that kind of more a back-half dynamic? Did that have any impact on the quarter at all?\nPatrick Campbell: Yes, Jeff, specifically on your question on label initiative. Very, very small here in the second quarter, that's going to take a couple of quarters to kind of gain some volume traction here. But the other thing, I guess, maybe I should have brought this up with Steve, is last year, if you recall during kind of the recession period, the retailers were really struggling getting floor traffic. So they actually try to pull some of their back-to-school into the second quarter. So one of the thing's that we did see fewer back-to-school sales in the second quarter, which we'll see now into the third quarter. So that's purely a timing issue.\nJeffrey Sprague: And then just finally on Commercial Graphics, you're not the first company this earning season to start to hint that maybe some of these commercial markets are looking better. I wonder there if you can parse apart just kind of underlying demand versus your own new product momentum in that market. You see a genuine turn in demand? Or you think it's new products and penetration there?\nGeorge Buckley: It's hard to know exactly, Jeff, where it's coming from. If you look at the report you'll see that some of those markets are still pretty moribund. But I think the sales into distribution, R&D distribution there, Jeff, for the most part, utility sales, commercial construction sales, those sorts of things, which you see now that's for market division. I actually just briefly mentioned that in my remarks it will be a 17% growth. So I think it's way too early, Jeff, to be suggesting there's some kind of resurgence there. I'm hard-pressed to believe that. So I think it's us getting this through new products. And maybe here and there, maybe there's a little bit of restocking. If there's any restocking anywhere, that's the place in these distribution channels is where you'd expect it, Jeff. So I don't want to be forecasting any kind of resurgence in that market. It is way too early at this moment. But it does seem that the product formula is working to the extent this activity in that market.\nPatrick Campbell: And a lot like the rest of our businesses, the growth rate outside of the U.S. was much higher in that business than it was inside the U.S. even though we did see some recovery back in the U.S. as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Terry Darling from Goldman Sachs.\nTerry Darling: I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the incremental margins in the second half of the year implied in guidance. It looks to me if you kind of scope the high end to the low end of the range, you're more in the mid-20s. You were kind of 39% in the first half, and we're talking about the price/cost getting less negative in the back half as you trend through it, presumably you're stepping up some investments in that context. But I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about the elements that are driving out lower incremental in the back half, and kind of what level of conservativeness you think you might be building in there?\nPatrick Campbell: I guess two things, I guess factual to kind of talk about it here. One is we are stepping up our investments in the back half of the year around growth activities. Those programs take a while to gain the traction, need be. The FX markets, we think, vis-\u00e0-vis the first half will be a little bit more unfavorable the way they're kind of playing out here. The baseline of the assumptions that we had at the end of the quarter, now the euro has kind of bounced back here a little bit. But the way we do our forecast is really kind of more off of a quarter-ending rate. So FX is a little bit unfavorable, and I think you're looking at it from OI leverage, not an EPS leverage because the other thing you see on the EPS side, of course, is our tax rate is higher at the back half of the year. But I think you're focusing more on the operating income leverage. So those will be kind of the factors that I see. And then the other question always becomes what happens to the fourth quarter? I feel reasonably good about third quarter volume levels. Fourth quarter is always kind of a question as to what happens come December, around plant utilization and the like.\nTerry Darling: And then you didn't get all the way into negative territory on net debt to cap, but you got pretty close. You did step up the buyback a little bit, but presumably, that's just in the context of offsetting the options. Just give us an update with regards to where you are in getting a little more aggressive with the balance sheet?\nPatrick Campbell: Well, on the repurchase, it was not just anti-dilution. It really was our view as to there was  some good buying opportunities in the second quarter. And that will still be our mantra is that if we see a good opportunities in the market, we will continue to pursue them. But I must also say, on the other side, is that George and I feel a lot better about our acquisition pipeline as it's materializing here in the second half of the year. So that's kind of balance all those factors out. We all know that reinvesting back in this business is the right thing to do. So that's going to be our first and foremost priority.\nGeorge Buckley: I mean, if you think about the many acquisitions we've done and all the rebuilding we've done, we still manage to maintain good growth, raising great returns, great margins. It's really why I posed that question. I posed it for ourselves before anybody posed it for us because I knew it was going to go down that pathway. And as Pat said, we have a number of quite exciting acquisitions, which are close to maturity that we hope to get completed in the second half of the year. I think you'll be quite impressed with some of them, some nice technology, areas that we're trying to get closed. So I think you'll see this concern disappear, certainly weighing as the year goes on.\nPatrick Campbell: And, Terry, also, I just want to rewind it back to Scott's question. Companies like us who have a pension legacy issue, part of the reason we do keep a very strong balance sheet is to be able to adjust to, I'll call it, shocks in the system. So we feel very good about our flexibility there.\nTerry Darling: Just then lastly, George, wonder if you could talk about the 25% increase in CapEx in 2011, presumably the biggest increments go to where the growth has been highest. But any other color you can put on those initiatives for us? It's a pretty big increase and, obviously, you wouldn't be making those if you didn't figure an opportunity to continue to grow the business, but maybe you can put some more color there for us.\nGeorge Buckley: No, Terry, there are a lot of places, which you're getting a little bit tight on capacity. In particular, it's the Renewables Energy area. We need more capacity there. We need more capacity in some of these very, very exotic, shirt abrasive grain areas. We need some more capacity in Optically Clear Adhesives. The demand for display technology, with the kind of things that we make for them, is just enormous. So they are the areas, but they're not the only areas we're seeing good growth in the general industrial tech usage. I suppose at some stage, we really think you see some other markets like construction come back. But as you quite likely pointed out, Terry, it's focus on those areas where we see the greatest growth. And even in our Optical Films business, it's quite remarkable that the guys in Optical done just an absolutely magnificent job of reinventing that business, driving out just awfully massive cost, I mean, eye-popping cost out of it and increasing productivity per square meter by almost 300 percentage, just really quite remarkable what they've done. And it looks like, now you can -- you know how that business can be. But it looks like that business is set for the next year or year and a half pretty nicely, maybe in a little longer. And we'll probably going to need some more capacity. You need to alter some of our capacity, modify some of our capacity is dedicated to other places of possible priority or put some new capacity in there. So that's where the demand is going to be, Terry.\nTerry Darling: George, just to follow up on that point on optical because it's interesting, I mean, with that much cost out, do you see that business, and obviously, there's still going to be cycle there, but do you see that the volatility of the margin through the cycle as less dramatic? I mean, through that cost out process, if you reduced the fixed cost, mix in that context or how should we think about that?\nGeorge Buckley: Yes, we have. I think you should yourself ask the questions and we ask it ourselves is what is the asymptote? The price on these electronics, it comes down and down and down and down. Of course, the ultimate goal of any large consumer electronics company making TVs is to have an empty box on the wall that cost nothing that does everything. And that's their ultimate goal. But if you just look at where the asymptote likely lie, look at the cost of materials, weigh them, look at the cost of the building material multiplied by some small return, and you can make some estimates of where that asymptote is going. If I was making an educated guess right now, Terry, I think the bottom of this cost reduction cycle for TVs comes within the next three years. And so I think if we continue to win that battle, so the asymptote gets there, I think the pricing pressure goes away. You reap the rewards of all the cost reductions and efficiencies that you've got. And what consequently happens when you get to the bottom of these kind of cycles, Terry, you see actually recounting. So I think this sort of matures then into a somewhat slower growth, stable margin, good margin, great relationship business that is like many other businesses in 3M, they've gone through this kind of transitions. I think the corner of that journey is somewhere close to three years away. So as long as we can keep on winning for around that time, Terry, we can be in great shape.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Bob Cornell of Barclays Capital.\nRobert Cornell: Just a couple of mop-up questions. At the Analyst Day, you mentioned, George, that the all incremental growth spending, a third of that would occur in the second quarter. Did it actually happen? Or sounds to me like you might have put some of the growth spending at the second half?\nPatrick Campbell: I'd say the answer for George there. I'd say that realistically, with the projects we've got, it takes a while to get people hired and then in place and executing. So I'd say probably, Bob, it's probably moved a little bit beyond more towards the back half of the year from where we obviously have penciled on paper.\nRobert Cornell: I mean, the corporate expense, and I like, allocated was again, your $80 million number looks like, which is in line with the first quarter but weighing more than I've modeled. I mean, what's going on there? What's the outlook for that line item for the year?\nPatrick Campbell: Well, Bob, what's in there, year-on-year specifically, is, I'll call it, the finance-related losses on our pension plan. And I think where we've modeled that, about $30 million a quarter, I believe, is kind of the year-on-year impact. Some of the other things that are rolling through there are as our earnings go up, we do have higher, I'll call it, variable comp around bonus payouts and so forth. And that flows through there as well.\nRobert Cornell: So how would you guide that for the balance of the year then? About $80 million a quarter?\nPatrick Campbell: I would say that, that or slightly less than that, Bob, would probably be my thinking.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa from JPMorgan.\nC. Stephen Tusa: Can you just talk about what the third quarter organic gross target is? Just to get an idea of this kind of realtime economy, no real restocking/destocking, just curious as to what you're seeing in near-term?\nPatrick Campbell: Steve, I don't think we gave a third quarter guidance number, but good try. But if you think about -- if you extrapolate the 13% to 15% and you take what we did in the first half, it kind of gives you a back half number if you just do the math as 8% to 12%. And you look at the comps, the comps are more difficult in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. So I think it's fair to say that the third quarter should be better than the fourth quarter from a reported perspective.\nC. Stephen Tusa: So that comp gets about 10 points tougher from the third to the fourth from negative 5% to positive 6%?\nPatrick Campbell: Yes, but I don't know if it's going to translate directly to that. I guess the other way I'd look at it is as I look at Q3 to Q2 is another way to think of it, I think Q3 will be a lot like Q2 from a revenue and absolute revenue perspective is maybe the way to kind of look at it, Steve.\nC. Stephen Tusa: And then just on D&G, I know you guys have talked about that margin going back to around 20%, but I guess you're saying it's now more stable at a higher level. Are you now coming off that kind of 20% target for D&G now?\nPatrick Campbell: Stable within our window of visibility, okay. What we've always said around that business, Steve, is that we understand the nature of playing in the consumer electronics game. And as long as George is explaining, as long as we're winning both on a cost standpoint and a product standpoint, it's a very good business. But you always have to be aware that, that business can change rapidly. So we're trying to bracket our thinking in that business around, on the downside, it can be a 20s type of margin business. But when it performs well, it will do very well for us. And we just want to be, I guess, fair with everybody to realize that within just kind of the nature of that business is that you can have that range of outcomes. But of course, what we're focused on is how do we keep the upside going? Realizing though that we have experienced and just the nature of the industry, such that at times, they can have a tendency to retract. So we're trying to provide a kind of a reasonable bookend for you to think about.\nGeorge Buckley: I think what was meaning [indiscernible] I'm sorry  I was just going to add something if I can, Steve. When I was speaking to Terry, I want to be clear that I meant that the stability would come when the asymptote had been reached. And the pressure on price, there will always be pressure on price in that industry. But I said that the 12, nice 12, nice 14 will probably translate to some minus three, that kind of number. And what I really mean is not the possibility of volatility between now and then, it's just when that asymptote is being reached. It's much more like it. This is a more stable, a more normal 3M-like business going forward.\nC. Stephen Tusa: You gave a great bridge, I think, last quarter on the sequential increases, whether it's merit pay, investment. Any kind of moving parts going from second to third quarter from a cost perspective that isn't related to volume that we should be aware of?\nPatrick Campbell: No, other than -- Terry did ask a question on incremental margin. When you kind of model it out, it does imply less than we've been running in Q1 and Q2. And really just around I guess two things: you got variability around foreign exchange and then you do have our new growth investment set as more back-half loaded, which is probably, we probably have $50 million to over $50 million more in the price of last half of the year than we do in the first of the year.\nGeorge Buckley: But they all going to accelerate, Steve. They really are.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts from Buckingham Research.\nJohn Roberts: The strong June volumes that you talked about in Germany and other export-like countries, they were actually up more than the average for the quarter. Is that just because the comps were easier? Did they bottom late so they had easier comps in June or are they actually accelerating up?\nPatrick Campbell: I just say they are accelerating. I mean, Germany, as the economy, has performed very well. Export-related businesses have performed well. But the question, remember that in the first half of last year, they were impacted. But I think Germany vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of Europe obviously has outperformed.\nJohn Roberts: Secondly, is back-to-school ordering in Consumer and Office back to pre-recession levels? Could you maybe just characterize how that feels relative to maybe on normal environment rather than the last year?\nPatrick Campbell: Because, John, it's a great, great question, I'm not so sure I can answer that. My intuition would say it's not. With unemployment the way it is and just a sensitivity around consumer spending, I would have a hard time believing that it's the same level that was back in kind of the pre-recession period. And remember, in the Consumer business, we actually start to see that all the way back into '07, so which is probably more of when the, I'll call it, the peak was.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal from FBR Capital Markets.\nAjay Kejriwal: Just a question on emerging market, nice growth there, 38%. And you gave some nice color by country. But wondering if you could provide some comments on how much of that 38% is just underlying growth in those markets versus what you're doing on new products and new channels and all the initiatives you have in driving growth there?\nGeorge Buckley: I don't know the answer at the top of my head, Ajay. But I would say it's at least a 2:1 ratio. And it may be as much as a 3:1 ratio. We'll get Matt to get those number afterwards. But it's an excellent multiple. We are doing much, much better in local those markets. You can think that China market number, for example, 50%-ish was growth in their market in the early teens. If you're aware, we're on a 3x or more of multiple there. Germany is  obviously not an emerging market, but their IPI for the quarter was around nine. We put in 20 for the month, 27 in June. So between two and three multiple there, and it's the same in Latin America. So it does seem to be coming from the share gain or new market creation. That's the conclusion I think that you have to reach.\nPatrick Campbell: Yes, I'd have a sense to look at it. What was the underlying growth rate of those economies, and say whatever we're kind of doing over and above that is really a combination of kind of penetration gains and new products. Recall what we said in some meetings is that one of our strategies is to invest heavily in these local technical organizations to develop products that are more closely aligned with local market demands. You start to see that significantly in place over like China and Brazil. Where we are, more and more, we got products that are more tuned to the local market. That we've also got the dynamic at a place like China where a lot of these electronics is moving to China. So a lot of the new product development that we've got in places like Optical and Optically Clear Adhesives also start to flow through in a place like China and Taiwan.\nAjay Kejriwal: As you look forward, that multiple versus the underlying economic growth in those countries, how do you feel about that? As you get some tougher comps, I would imagine some of that math will get compressed. But, I mean, the 38% looks a really robust number.\nPatrick Campbell: I think if Inge Thulin was here, I think Inge would say that his objective for the emerging markets continues to be in that 2.5x, 3x the economy growth rates.\nAjay Kejriwal: And then on H1N1, that was clearly a headwind for both Health and Safety in the quarter. Maybe if you can remind us how much of that headwind in the third and the fourth quarters was 2Q the big, tough comp?\nMatt Ginter: In each of Q3 and Q4 for the company, the number was about $90 million. So it's the equivalent of about a one and a half of drag on the growth rate for the total company in each of Q3 and Q4, Ajay. And the great majority of that would be in Safety, Security, Protection.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Feldman from UBS.\nJason Feldman: A little bit of a follow-up on some of the supply chain issues, as long as it's ramped up, had you had issues with your own supply chain and the flip side as well? You've mentioned double ordering in electronics, do you think this capacity, but are there areas where you're really having difficulty keeping up with the demand or losing on a business today because of capacity constraint?\nGeorge Buckley: Yes, in some cases, I think that's what we are. There are some unmet needs, Jason, here and there. I think that's a fair observation.\nJason Feldman: And there's been a lot of talk about internal investments in R&D, but specifically, on the marketing and advertising, Consumer and Office and elsewhere, should we think of this as kind of a new run rate or we see kind of continued material linked business going forward?\nPatrick Campbell: Well, I would say it's a new run rate until we decide that they're all, obviously, that they are paying off. And then we decide if we want to take on new investments on top of that. So in absolute dollars, we're now ramping up our spending. And then thus far, we're very confident on our growth projections for those investments. So if they continue to pay off the way we think they will, then obviously, we'll take a look to see should we ramp them up more? Now if you look at our ratio of sales, if you take a look at say SG&A, I do believe their SG&A cost will continue to get leverage out of SG&A in total as our revenue expands.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies & Company.\nAmanda Sigouin: This is Amanda Sigouin on for Lawrence. Concerning the consumer electronics end market, is 3M seeing any signs of momentum slowing here? And is that likely because customers are running into capacity limit?\nPatrick Campbell: I mean, I guess, we haven't seen it specifically from our business, and I think part of this is cluttered a little bit because of, as George hummed about double ordering and so forth, the supply chain has been very, very, put it in kind of a fragile state. I've seen some reports over the last week where there's been some belief that maybe there's a little bit of a kind of a slowing and pull back a little bit. But thus far, we haven't seen it on our site from a demand perspective yet.\nGeorge Buckley: Amanda, the interesting thing about some of this big growth in electronic recently has come from technology changes, has come from the movement from CCFL backlit, LCD TVs, LED TVs, driven by brighter pictures, higher refresh rates, and much lower energy usage. So you've seen this driven by consumer making the choice to not only get new technology but getting it, with cost savings the source side of it. Certainly, all these display, these smart phones, smart display devices are all driving a large demand, new gaming, 3D cameras, 3D televisions, 3D gaming. So I think it's coming from new technology, and it is not necessarily connected directly with kind of consumer sentiment. Now whether in the end, that will fall off as bulls, we always would expect, it is. But in our business, we haven't seen anything to cause -- it doesn't mean there have at least some changes here and there, but nothing we've seen that would cause us any untoward upset. So, so far, so good.\nAmanda Sigouin: And just moving to the automotive and related aftermarkets, could you provide any further color on trends you're seeing there and the outlook for the back half?\nPatrick Campbell: Well, in the Automotive Aftermarket, probably, we'll be more like kind of current pace of activity. So that doesn't really change that dramatically. The OEM, so you'll get into a comp issue here as you get to the back half of the year. First half had very, very robust build increases, 25% in the first half auto builds. That will not continue in the back half of the year as how the industry went through the traction last year. They start to ramp up production in Q3, Q4 last year. So you just start to see smaller increases on a year-over-year basis on the auto side.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.\nMatt Ginter: Well, thank you very much, everybody. Hope you like the presentations and like the results, very much appreciate your spending time with us listening, and we look forward to talking to you soon. Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 1, "year": 2010, "date": "2010-04-28 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: [ABRUPT START] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, April 27, 2010. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nMatt Ginter: Welcome to our first quarter earnings call and business review. Before we address this quarter\u2019s results, I want to mention two up coming events. First is our up coming Plant Tour and Consumer and Office Business Review, scheduled for the morning of June 29th, at our posted manufacturing facility in Cynthiana, Kentucky. A formal invite will be sent out shortly. In the meantime please hold the date. Also as I mentioned on the January earnings call, we have set aside the morning of Tuesday, December 7th for our Annual Outlook Meeting in New York City. Complete details regarding timing and location will be available later this year. Before I turn things over to George, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements on slide 2. During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about out future performance and financial results. Those statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. So, let's begin today's review. Turn to slide number three and I\u2019ll turn it over to George.\nGeorge Buckley: Thank you very much, Matt and good morning everybody. By now, you\u2019ve all seeing the numbers and we hope that investors are happy with our progress in first quarter. Last quarter, I told you that I\u2019ve never been more confident in our growth prospects and the first quarter is exhibit Asia we call and just the reason why we feel that way. It was spectacular quarter of many contribute especially gratifying as an affirmation of both our strategic direction and of implementation of our plan. A few highlights if I may please. Sales grew by 25% in the quarter this was the largest single percentage quarter increase in any memory or record yet, with organic volume improvement over 19%. Adjusting for special items in this case Medicare Part D earning was $1.40 per share, an all time 3Mregard for the first quarter. We maintain our best-in-class margins at 22.8%. up 700 basis points year-on-year. I can think of no better way to refuse some of the collection margin doubt in (inaudible). The strong performance was across the board, all of business posted double digit sales growth along with 20% plus operating income margins and some like display and graphics, electrco and communications and industrial and transportation were particularly outstanding. Geographically, sales growth were strongest in emerging economies where sales expanded by 47% versus the first quarter 2009. We are trying to posting a huge volume gain at 63%, Korea 74% and Taiwan whopping 88% gain. (inaudible) in March we had 16 countries across the world by the sales growth was 50% or better, yes 16 countries. Korea and Taiwan were 75% in March and these are not small businesses. United States was no slouch either in this growth rates. Sales were up over 11% in the quarter and up 18% in March. This was done even while we committed to accelerate R&D spent this year by apparent $100 million. Over the next two years, there\u2019s no doubt in our mind that this additional spend is going to accelerate our growth rate substantially, is a proven formula for us and we intend to ride it. Across the total line, this raises a number of key questions, for us, why do we see [segment] interest in growth in the quarter? Where is it coming from, and what is it mean for this year and the years beyond. Second, why do we feel confident in raising our guidance by $0.50 on both the low end and high ends of the range, which is a very healthy increase only three months into the year? We\u2019re seeing improving numbers in most company earnings report so far this quarter with high growth rates in Asia. So that far of it is not surprised to anyone, but this quarter\u2019s growth rate exceeds any conventional market expansion explanation we have. Let me take you through our best thinking about, where the 25% sales increase came from. Understanding, that in a company like ours with so many moving parts in markets, decision is always a new elusive animal to apprehend. There is what we know with reasonable certainty, acquisitions, net of divestitures added 0.3%, crossing in aggregate added 4.2% and currency translation added five percentage points. The remainder of course is a super organic growth number of over 19%. I\u2019d like now to try to help you understand where the growth came from. So let\u2019s spend a minute as to analyzing the 19% jump. We now said with you (inaudible) geographic breakdown, where a leader of wholly IPI not a wholly GDP company, though we have elements at both in our mix. To a rough approximation, $6 billion of our annual sales worldwide GDP dependent, $11.5 billion our worldwide IPI dependent, $3.6 billion our Asia IPI, and $5 billion our US GDP. While we use the Global Insight forecast numbers on slide 3, we get a blended customer market index of about 7.2%, pretty close to the 7.3% worldwide IPI number for the quarter. So that explains 7.2% in our market growth, leaving 12% still to be explained. I see more cushy numbers inventory restocking. Some commentaries from our industrial peers suggest that this part of the growth dynamic is over. Well across, we\u2019re not sure we have the (inaudible) get started. Moreover quite a few of our supply chains, consumer electronics in particular and automotive too for that matter have a little or no channel inventory to speak off, so they are not really a factor involved in driven by supply chain transient.. In the US, if you look at the census for your data on inventories, they haven\u2019t moved up a lot. Last day they showed US inventories moving up by less than 1% year-over-year. Historically, (inaudible) sales transients was just 1% factor is, we see the sales result magnified in the channel by various factor. So we would expect some of our US sales to be impacted by this condition. Given our roughly, one-third mix of US sales are practically would spread above 1% of the quarter's sales growth, but we are also conservative, are going to extend it globally saying the amounted to the same total worldwide. That would explain 3% of the growth with 9% still to be explained. Another factor is new product. We\u2019ve done our level best to drive these other metric growth, knowing full well, is the best source of value creation, and new product vitality index is running close to 30% on a five year basis, headed to 40% at the end of the planning period. Offsetting these, we will be using an estimate of 2% to 3% erosion and cannibalization annually, but I think manage the (inaudible) strategy may have used that erosion a bit. Of course it\u2019s difficult to discern the difference between penetration from new products and market share gains. They aren\u2019t exactly mutually exclusive concepts, but our best estimate point to a new product gain of 3% to 4% of this sales growth. That leaves four or five points of additional growth in the quarter to be explained, and that leads to the inescapable conclusion that we\u2019re taking market share. Now as an engineer, I was trained never to determine a small number from the difference into large numbers, but this is as good as we can get right now and candidly, I think we also gain significant share in the fourth quarter too. To support that view, look at what three indicators alone are telling us about sales in some key markets. First, in automotive for example, worldwide auto builds were up 39% in Q1. In comparison, our unit growth for the quarter was up 67%, well in excess of the auto build proxy. Second, if we use Intel\u2019s Q1 logic and chipset unit growth as a proxy for sales growth in the consumer electronics industry. Volume was up year-over-year by 44% with average selling price about flat. Correspondingly, Gartner also reported PC shipments in Q1 were up 27%. In contrast, our electronic related businesses grew at about 85% for the quarter and was very broad based, not just LCD TVs. Again, while this is not an accurate scientific comparison, it is a leading indicator of significant penetration. Third, in consumer, same store sales in the US naturally varied widely, but the best performing companies grew same store sales by 2% to 4%, the orders were negative. We grew volumes in the quarter by nearly 11%, very impressive when compared with same store performance of big box outlets in the United States. Global GDP was up only 3%. This was great execution of the plan by 3M people, but also because of the vibrancy of our new technologies and products. I\u2019ll give you a few examples quickly of how the plan is working. Especially is it relates to growing our core new products and manage the pyramid more effectively. Example number one (inaudible) acquisition [Nylonj] enabled to homecare division to realize increase in sales with 20% year-over-year, by driving up the pyramid with branded products and this is one on of our mature core businesses, scoring products. Second our entry to renewal energy demonstrates our result not to back off investing in the future. We form this division in January 2009 during the darkest days of the recession. Essentially about bringing together technology in products from all across 3M to address nearly every facet of renewable energy components. Solar mirrors for example shown terrific growth and sales in renewable energy are up 72% in the first quarter. We build a new coating line in Singapore for this business. We grew opened last September and it\u2019s already sold out. We\u2019re working on the next one as we speak. Third, the Electro and Communication business is another example of 3M staying the course on investments in the future. Promising this business include a hugely successful optically clear adhesive for use in touch screen applications. Novec fluids in carrier tapes, ECB sales were up 39% in Q1. Fourth, an example of reinvigorating our core, industrial adhesives in tape division is paying much more broadly across the entire product spectrum and its growth in Q1 of 31% was impressive, and the long line of new inventions continues with new tape product that includes holy grail of adhesives, it will stick to another surface, believe it or not. So in summary, it was a great quarter, well ahead of any market trends and probably with the good share penetration gain element to it. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Pat, and he will give you some details on the quarter.\nPat Campbell: Thanks George and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide number 4, on our GAAP reported basis, first quarter earnings were $1.29 per share, a healthy 74% increase over the first quarter of 2009, included in that result was a one-time non-cash income tax charge of $84 million or $0.11 of share resulting from a Medicare Part D changes embedded in the recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act here in the U.S. Our prior earnings expectations from the January earnings call were based upon the tax line effect as of the date and therefore do not contemplate this change or charge. So excluding this item, earnings were $1.40 per share, which is an all-time record for any first quarter in the company\u2019s history, up 89% versus the first quarter of 2009 GAAP earnings per share. Importantly, we achieved this result less than a record sales. As our first quarter sales were still below 2008 levels. So there\u2019s no doubt that we\u2019re running the company today with a much more competitive cost position. On the whole, our first quarter performance was ahead of our own expectations. So the year is off to a very strong start. Let\u2019s examine a few of the details, please turn to slide number 5. Since the worst of last year's recession, we have now put together a string of outstanding quarters, and the first quarter was the best thus far. First quarter sales increased nearly 25% and this growth came from virtually every part of the world. Asia Pacific grew 54% and the combined Latin America, Canada regions expanded sales by 26%. European sales grew 15.9% and growth in the US was 11.6%. We experienced double-digit worldwide sales increases in every business segments led by Display and Graphics of 42%, Electro and Communications of 39%, and Industrial and Transportation at 29%. Gross profit grew 34% year-on-year, gross margins rose 3.5 points to 49%. In a number of positive factors worth work here including the 19% growth in organic sales volume, substantially improved factory utilization levels along with cost savings related to prior year\u2019s restructuring actions. Currently, we are sustaining those gains. Finally, our [metal] Six Sigma teams continue to drive significant yield improvement and cost reductions efforts throughout our factories. As the economy improves, we shall see a nice continuous stream of productivity and efficiency gains. SG&A cost increased 11% which included a 30% increase in advertising and promotion investments to drive future volumes. As a percent of sales, SG&A declined by 260 basis points. We invested $342 million in R&D in the first quarter, the year-on-year increase of 6%. Given how all the business is performing, we recently improved an additional $40 million of investments for the remainder of 2010, spread across a number of businesses to drive new growth programs. These investments will largely impact the SG&A and R&D lines of the income statement. Operating income rose 80% to $1.4 billion and operating margins were an outstanding 22.8%. The first quarter tax rate was 31.9% on a GAAP basis which of course includes the charge related to Medicare Part D. Excluding this charge the tax rate was 26%, which were 4 points better then last year's rate. Due to a lower international tax rate along with the resolution of our 2008, US federal tax audits. In light of this, we now expect our full year tax rate to be at 28% or lower, excluding the impact of the Medicare Part D. It is encouraging to us that strategy is really beginning to play out in the numbers. Growth is accelerating, cost remains under very good control and margins and returns remain among the best in class. Sequential P&L highlights were on slide number 6. It is clear that our business is improving quarter-by quarter. Sales increased 4% as both our Industrial and Transportation and Electro and Communications business pose it great sequential improvements across most of the respective operating units. Gross profit rose 6% sequentially, driven largely by stronger factory throughput along with higher sales levels. First quarter raw material cost was flat to slightly higher than the forth quarter, as we are seeing some up-tick and inflation, they will begin to affect us in Q2. Both SG&A and R&D cost low as 5% sequentially partially due to higher stock option expense. You may recall that because we have stocks options in February of each year, our first quarter expense is higher than the fourth quarter. Operating income rose 8% sequentially despite of five points rate from options, and incremental margins were raised strong at 46%. Now, let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet in cash flow, please turn to slide number 7. All we know the one of our key objectives entering the recessions was the focus on cash flow generation and are carefully managing our balance sheet. For example to keep a close eye on receivables balances and I\u2019m monitoring the financial conditions of our customers in order to optimally manage credit terms. Also we put actually emphasis on driving higher inventory returns and made it to top priority in our 2009 planning. Now that the business is growing again you can see that these offers are really paying off. First quarter free cash flow was $925 million, a record for any first quarter in the company's history, and more than two times that of the prior year. Free cash flow conversion was nearly 100%. Now, working capital turns were 5.3 in March month end, a 20% improvement versus March 2009 levels. Inventories rose by 5% year-on-year, a modest jump in a quarter when sales rose 25%. As a result inventory returns were 4.4 at 10% improvement over the first quarter of 2009. Accounts receivable increased 15% year-on-years again well below sales growth levels. March sales typically the highest in the quarter, so there is not any visual to see receivables wisely even the quarter only the subsequently fall in early in the following quarters payments are remitted. Regardless accounts receivables turns were healthy 7.1 in March, up one after (inaudible) March of last year. All-in-all, our working capitals are in good shape and we\u2019re in well position as the economy improves. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $157 million, down $87 million year-on-year. We expect CapEx to accelerate in the remainder of 2010 and our full-year estimate remains in that range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Dividends paid to common shareholders were $374 million for the first quarter including a per-share increase of 3% in February. This was the 52nd consecutive year dividend increases for 3M. Now, let's review the performance of our business units. Please turn to slide number 8. Industrial and Transportation is our largest segment representing about one third of 3M sales and they had fabulous performance in the quarter. First quarter sales in the segment grew 29% to $2.1 billion. The local currency terms sales were 23.7% which is almost entirely driven by organic volume. This growth was across the board in the quarter as most every business in the segment posted doubled digit local currency sales growth. Sequential sales increase 6.6% in the first quarter, so the business continues to improve day-by-day. In addition to the great performance in automotive renewables and tapes the George mentioned were also positive double digit local currency sales growth [end of races]. Aerospace, purification systems and energy and advance material. All in all industrial and transportation performance this quarter was quite strong and very broad based. And they are still plenty of upside going forward as unit volume just tell 10 points below the peak levels that we saw in 2008. Operating income for the quarter for $254 million, an increase of a 160% and margin is double to nearly 22%. The business list has taken out significant structural cost in the past couple of years therefore the operating leverage is quiet significant. In the last three year under (inaudible) leadership, industrial and transportation has significantly stepped up his level of customer engagement and new product flow. Examples include our new (inaudible) tube a revolutionary self sharpening and bracing that provide significant productivity advantage to our customers. We are on track to begin best production of this product in the second half of this year. We also recently introduced Scotchgard integrating (inaudible) film to protects against vandalism and mass transit in retail spaces. These are only two examples of many. We also receive some important customer accolades in the first quarter. Our automotive OEM team received Hardest 2009 Development Award recognizing technically significant contributions to the manufacturing processes, and also recognize of Japanese subsidiary, Sumitomo 3M, for developing an interior film for their upcoming new hybrid car. [Honda is outstanding customer who you can't be recognize by empower efforts]. Our final business development though, our renewable energy business signed a cooperative R&D agreement with the US Department of Energy\u2019s National Renewable Energy Laboratory to accelerate a number of clean power projects in order to help and meet the nation's carbon free energy needs. Please turn the slide number 9, Electro and Communications for the first time in many quarters was one of our fastest growing businesses. During the worst of the recession, this team has been set faster in our sales efforts, working bench-to-bench with our customers to drive future growth opportunities. We are now finding the many of our competitors cut much deeper that we did, and now that businesses picking up there are plenty of demand coming our way. In particular, this provided a boost in many of our optical clear adhesives, novec fluids, carrier tapes and wafer processing possessing materials for semiconductor manufacturing. First quarter sales in the Electro and Communications were $665 million up 38.6% in US dollars and up 34.3% in local currency. Foreign exchange impacts added 5.3 points of first quarter growth. Growth was once again led by our businesses that supply their consumer electronic and semiconductor industries. They clearly drove most of the growth in Q1. But it\u2019s also very encouraging to see double-digit local currency growth in our electrical market businesses were supplies, connectors and other solutions to power utility, MRO and appliance markets. On the flip side, our telecom infrastructure business related businesses have been (inaudible) grown in the market they remain very sluggish. Electro and Communication positive the side 20.6% operating margin in the first quarter, which is over four times up of last year\u2019s first quarter. Much stronger sales in factory utilization were obviously a factor but I don\u2019t want to take anything away from this team's ongoing commitment to productivity, yield improvement and waste reduction and the like. They really did fine job navigating through the recession and are now reaping the rewards of those efforts, on the new business front, we continue to fight much more aggressively from market share in this business. For example we are driving increased to spec in of 3M components and touch enabled devices. The semiconductor carrier tape was successfully expanded our product offering to participate more broadly and capture additional growth in consumer electronics, including the LED space. In the electrical markets with gaining substantial share in the North American OEM insulating tape markets by aggressively capitalizing on the access of reformer competitor. The list of similar examples continues to grow, electro communications business is off to a strong start in 2010, look for continued improvement as the year progresses. Please turn to slide 10, where I will review our Display and Graphics business. Display and graphics also deliver great strong first quarter, again consumer electronics was a key thing but the performance in the D&G continues to broaden out to other businesses as well. First quarter sales were $869 million up 42% year-on-year, sales rose 38.4% in local currency which was entirely organic. Profits more than tripled to $212 million and operating margins were 24.3%. Factory utilization was much improved versus last year\u2019s challenging first quarter, and the business continues to do a tremendous job in reducing cost. First quarter growth was led by optical film business where sales doubled year-on-year, this was a function of both strong end market growth and consumer electronics, particularly LCD TVs along with a number of important new 3M product solutions for the industry. The LCD TV market is rapidly transitioning to LED led from traditional CCFL bulb-lit technology and our films are playing vital role in this transition. Our films are also an important enabler in the ongoing transition to more energy efficient TVs. Of course, part of life cycles in this space are quite short and nobody knows this better than our team, so the leadership is relentlessly focused on next-generation solutions for the industry, and we continue to aggressively driving lean Six Sigma in our optical factory, so that we capture all available future sales and profit opportunities. Another sizeable business within Display and Graphics is our traffic safety systems business, which is the leading global supplier of high performance reflected materials for the roadways and construction work zones. Traffic safety system had a fabulous first quarter with double digit sales growth, and solid profitability. Similar to recent quarter, growth continues to be very good in developing areas of the world, where highway infrastructure development continues to accelerate and stimulus spending is making a real positive difference. Growth in the US on the other hand has been much more modest, as it appears at the legislative focus at the federal and state level is on areas other than highways safety. In recent Investor Meetings, we have talked quite a bit about broadening our product offering to play bigger across the entire product pyramid. Traffic safety system is one business at 3M that does this very, very well. For the past two years, we\u2019ve offered films assessed by our customer needs across the entire spectrum, good, better and best if you will. In addition, the team has (Inaudible) better in this global leadership position films with adjacent offerings and reflective pavement markings, roadway maintenance systems and service and vehicle registration systems. Traffic safety systems remain a very steady performer within displaying graphics, which nicely compliments the more volatile growth trends that are inherent in consumer electronics. Commercial graphics also had a very solid quarter with double digit growth and continue sequential sales improvements as the advertising segments that reserve recover from recession. This business has recently introduced new promotional films to compete more broadly across the product pyramid. Finally, within our newly formed mobile projection systems business we received some nice accolades for a new 3M 150 Pocket Projector which was named Nelson Award finalist in technology category. Winners are to be announced later this month. Please turn to slide 11. Sales in the consumer office space rose 15% in the first quarter to $912 million. Local currency sales rose 11%, the majority of which was organic growth, we also had 2.6% growth from acquisitions in the quarter. This growth happened throughout consumer and office in our business in geographic regions posted positive local currency growth. As George mentioned our Home Care business posted tremendous growth in the quarter, we recently acquired two smaller yet very strategic companies in Latin America to expand our presents in this market. We also drove double digit local currency growth in the consumer Health Care business which we bolstered in the past couple of years with two very important Bolton acquisitions (inaudible). We now have a formidable consumer health care line up across the retail landscape. The do it yourself business also posted very nice sales growth driven by our command adhesives and Scotch-Blue Painter's tapes. To drive volumes in these and other critical brands, we increase first quarter advertising and merchandizing investments by over 40% and even with this high investment levels first quarter profits in consumer offers rose 33% to $219 million and margins were healthy 24%. All businesses drove double-digit profit gains in the quarter. Finally, I will be remiss if I did not mention that 2010 March 30th anniversary of Post-it Note. Three decades after this introduction, this category defining brand continues to grow with the slow new offerings and adjacent solutions. Please turn to slide 12. In safety, security and protection services, sales grew 20.4% in the first quarter. Local currency growth was 14.7% and currency effects added 5.7% to first quarter sales. As in the past few quarters, the biggest growth driver here was a personal protection business or more specifically respiratory products. As a global leader in protective respirators, we\u2019ve seen significant growth related to H1N1 virus for several quarters running. We estimate the H1N1 related sales were approximately $45 million in the quarter which is about one half the impact we saw in the fourth quarter. So clearly the impact has begun to wane. On the flip side, the industrial manufacturing sector is picking up resulting in additional respiratory growth. We expect this transition to continue which should help us successfully manage to wane down the H1N1 related activity. Elsewhere in the safety, security and protection services, we saw outstanding growth in the roofing granules business, which we attribute primarily to inventory build at this point. Until we see signs of residential construction and roofing placement activities fundamental improving, we remain cautious about growth in any one quarter. We also process our growth in our building and commercial services business where we continue to take market share in the area of Floor Pads and Cleaners, including the Scotchgard brand for finishing systems. You can see here on the chart that we had a nice win in the first quarter, involving John Hopkins Medical Center. First quarter operating profit was $181 million in Safety, Security and Protection services, up 46% year-over-year and margins were 22.4%. Please turn to slide 13 for a final business review, Health Care. Through the worst of last year\u2019s recession, we\u2019re often reminded of how important it was to have a thriving Health Care business in our portfolio. End markets in this business continue to grow nicely and generally speaking those markets are highly stable. First quarter sales in Health Care were $1.1 billion, up 12% in dollars and 7.6% in local currency. Foreign exchange impacts added 4.6% to first quarter sales. Sales increase in most every business within Health Care, led by double digits currency sales growth in both infection prevention and in skin and wound care. We\u2019re seeing good demand in a number of important areas including skin integrity and advanced wound care. We also continue to drive growth with our new Tegaderm CHG Dressing for I.V. site, which was recently launched in both Western Europe and Brazil. Elsewhere in Health Care, we drove solid single digit local currency growth throughout most of the portfolio. Drug delivery systems grew nicely as demand picked up for the traditional inhaler fills. Oral care continue to accelerate growth with orthodontic products showing particular strength during the quarter, and we drove mid single digit local currency growth in health information system where we recently introduced our new 3M Mobile Dictation Software for iPhone, Blackberry and Windows Mobile platforms. Looking at sales by geography, local currency grew in all major areas, led by Latin America at 19% and Asia Pacific at 16%. Operating profits was 13% to $347 million and margins were just over 31%. Health Care continues to gain recognition both from customers and with industry experts. For example, the business has usually recently named the Number Two Most Admired Company in the Medical and Precision Equipment space by Fortune Magazine. Our oral care business once again was named most innovative dental company by the Anaheim Group. 3M oral care has now won these for five years in running. In a food safety, a Clean - Trace ATP system was chosen to monitor sanitation of food preparation at the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai. Health Care continues to exemplify innovation at 3M. That concludes my review of our business segment. So, now I will turn it back to George.\nGeorge Buckley: Thank you very much, Pat. Well, let\u2019s take a look now at the remainder of the year. I like being on this side of the gradient a lot better than I did the other, but in reality the forecasting which get no easier, I think you have very long large growth rates when you have very large contractions. I will do to demystify for what\u2019s happening. There\u2019s certainly lot of forward momentum in our sales volume, so the (Inaudible) is how this will pay out in the coming quarters. We\u2019ll show so good sales growth in the fourth quarter. We can think one of observation being a data point, two being a trend, and three all more to me is a pattern. So I think, we\u2019re closely seeing whether this growth is in fact have pattern or just a temporary abrasion of wary economy dealing with recovery. Perhaps, we had inventory, others didn\u2019t, or we could find them sit where, others couldn\u2019t. (inaudible) my target it will slip back as growth normalizes and credit availability improves and ultimate could argue once the shares is us to lose to as to win. I\u2019ve heard comments in news media that anyone now doubting a strong US recovery is silly. Result has said that maybe uncomfortable uncertainties formal ridiculous. It is nothing magical about where the bank comes from, it comes only when and from where people or companies spend money, we\u2019ve observe increased order slowing non-cycle companies, because it's no optimism now on the likelihood of sustainability. The housing stocks in the United States increased in March by about 20% year-over-year to an annualized rate to 626,000 which is also 1.6% up on February. Non transportation rate of durable goods orders rose by about 3% and we sold that some of the appliance make it results. US also has been the best performers and improved by 21% and much more helpful numbers that (inaudible). The total sales in these factors are only a bit more than $100 billion annually target big stimulus in US. In contrast to these gains, US commercial construction would probably still get worse before it get better. Now, do I expect capital spending in telecoms or in to utilities to increase in the immediate future. In summary, I don't think we should look to the US for big recovery in 2010. More likely is going to be a slow, patchy and gradual recovery, punctuated by period of occasional back sliding. Unemployment rates fall in the logic could be the genesis of any sustained US recovery and productivity gains are set couple lot of any increased demand. So we retained to right to be cautious in this period of uncertainty or driving for much more growth as we can get mean time as conditions unfold. But just because we cautious in conservative doesn't mean we won't and can\u2019t drive for good growth. We've already shown that. Unfortunately by for the biggest piece of our recoveries coming from overseas market, substantially in early in emerging markets, it's also coming from large developed Asian economies such as Korea, Taiwan even Japan. Japan\u2019s sales grew in the first quarter by 35% by 38% in March so hope for overseas growth is still much better than the United States. Demand at this rate is likely to be maintained at least into the middle of the second quarter, (inaudible) transient took about two quarters to settle in the downward economic slide, economy is probably by directional. So that element of growth might subside in early Q3. H1N1 demand is also according to pass and with phase of 1.5% growth that in the second half, that I also believe improved industrial demand will offset some of that anticipated decline and new low cost products will help too. High material and waste cost in the second half also factor. For you information USPPI increased by 6% year-over-year in the first quarter. Then you have the simple arithmetic issue of how the year-over-year comes in the second half. This is obvious for a conservative stands in the second half at least for now. The main point however is that no matter what shape the recovery takes, 3M in a much stronger position to face economic growth than we ever were even once a year ago. Our forecast that when the term would come was very accurate and that avoided the need to over react. We never pull back on investing on the future and that has to be helping. So let me address our outlook for the year. With a strong first quarter behind us, we\u2019re raising our full year 2010 expectations. We now believe that organic sales growth will come in between 10% and 12% versus the prior expectation of 5% to 7%, that is almost doubling our forecast sales growth rate. We also expect that earnings per share will fall somewhere be in the demand of $5.40 to $5.60 on an adjusted basis versus a prior expectation to $4.90 to $5.10. We anticipated operating margins will return to the 22% plus level for the year, which is a level we just last saw in 2007. So the business has really responded well coming out of the recessions. The 2010 tax rate, excluding Medicare Part D charge is expected to be less than or equal to 28%. And finally weighted average shares outstanding should fall some where between $723 million and $737 million for 2010 in total. And that concludes our formal comments for today, and we will be happy now to address your questions. Thank you very much everybody for listening.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Morgan Stanley.\nScott Davis: Hi, good morning, guys. Pretty big core gross number you put together there.\nMatt Ginter: We really thought its pretty good, Scott.\nScott Davis: About three years of growth in one quarter. Anyways, couple of things, guys you didn\u2019t spend a whole lot of time in the presentation talking about use of this free cash flow and you are sitting very nicely on a fairly large cash balance your obviously had some dry powder there. What's out there? You've got a little bit of share count slippage in your forecast. Is there anything holding you back from buying back shares, or is that just reflect on how strong the M&A environment could potentially be for you this year?\nPat Campbell: Scott, obviously there is a very good question and I guess the way were thinking of it is corresponding of our growth opportunities is the highest party for the company. You look at our results in returns that are obviously what we think as the best pay back for the shareholders, and we think the long term growth prospectus for the company. So we are continue to obviously push the organic side of it, we did indicate that we are going to increase some of our investment programs unlike, but importantly we are active in the M&A market. We have announced anything, we are looking at fair amount of deals are in the pipeline, neither George or I feel compelled, though to be pushed okay to utilize the cash that we have in appropriately. So we will remain our cautious sales we always have will be but we are looking at a number of deals across our businesses, probably more focused internationally than recent track record would lead you to believe because of part of it is we do have more cash outside of the US and much more our cash generation capability outside the United States, and we think we are just huge growth potentially outside the United States as well. We made a number of small strategic deals in home care that we have talked about in the like and we were prospecting for those across the logos as we speak. But I would guess more like the second half of the year before you would see much relative to anything of size.\nGeorge Buckley: Scott, we follow the same pattern that we always have slightly can we close to call; it will be very easily manageable. I don't think Pat or I see any hugely disruptive or blockbuster acquisitions. And when you look behind these numbers one thing that perhaps we didn\u2019t emphasis strongly we might it done is, we\u2019ve got a lot of places in these new advanced technology that we\u2019ve release, Scott. That really capacity is just being mopped up immediately. So, we do have some pretty good internal choices although they obviously small relative spend time they are relative to some of things he is speaking about. So, overall I think, situation gives great choices and we\u2019ll develop as the year unfolds.\nScott Davis: Sure. Guys, as a follow on, your Asia-Pacific growth numbers 47%, big numbers, and if I was to make one particular last several years, I would say that I thought your Asia-Pacific growth was a little, China in particular, a little bit disappointing versus the potential. Obviously, we\u2019ve inflected up there. What do you kind of attribute that to? Is there a wider rollout of SKUs, is it capacity? Is it sales? I mean what do you kind of attribute that inflection point in emerging markets?\nGeorge Buckley: Well, we have been building plans Scott, last few years. So, there is no question having locally available capacity is part of issue I think, that we followed a China for China strategy. We don\u2019t use China is an export source. The other thing is that starting really about a year ago we began to hire lot of extra people for a lot of extra money. We have growth expansion plan in the industrial and consumer office, in medical and so the money has been put to work Scott and now we begin to see some of the opportunity coming through, So we are actually in the process of reorganization where we can are getting closer contact with the market, and I think clearly the number demonstrate, but I think the future holds this wonderful prospects, so that part of the world and they do same in India and in Russia too Scott. We are building in building new lab, they are sitting our last quarter conference call. That\u2019s turned out to be for us to allow, to not being absolute money bank guarantee on growth. So I think it's reason to expect that this will continue not withstanding any other issues the China itself may have in the economy.\nPat Campbell: Yes Scott there was a piece I was going to pick up on was that I think the piece that would really have start to see a large traction on is our local lab capability in places like China, and have really started to develop a lot of new product idea, so you met skews so forth. They were getting a lot of new products of our developing market lab organizations these days to get price at more appropriate for these markets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone\nMatt Ginter: Good morning.\nJeff Sprague: As you said, there are a lot of different things and it\u2019s maybe hard to totally deconstruct the magnitude of your out performance. But I wonder if you could elaborate on the idea that you or Pat alluded to, I don't recall now that competitors cut perhaps too far and were left flat footed by this. And clearly, they will try to rebound, but I guess just thinking about the competitive dynamics. How big of an impact do you think that was and what can you do to extend that lead now that you\u2019ve established it in a few key areas?\nGeorge Buckley: Well, I don\u2019t think there this sort of comment Jeff, with this (inaudible) my engineering training and trying determine a small number subtract in difference in two large numbers both of which we\u2019ve got either a result or variability in them. So it\u2019s really hard to get down on those numbers, I mean it\u2019s especially muddy Jeff when you see the huge number of markets we serve and the huge number of product. So everything ends up being a little bit of this and a little bit of that. But we are seeing some competitors getting weaker. I really what to try to do my level best to impress on you the hugely significant change in the way we\u2019ve gone to market here and particularly in the optical business. And we always, we tended to serve the OEM markets, we are little bit disconnected there from the set manufacturer in particular, we have altered that completed. We\u2019ve gone right to the end markets. We\u2019ve reestablished trust and I think in the end most of these guys Jeff, they believe in us, they believe this is the place where the innovation is coming. They see the product you are seeing coming out in the market. This is the stuff that being invented by 3M, even the facilitating LED technology being facilitated by 3M. So one thing is very, very different here is the relationship between us and our customers, and I'm hoping what that does is secure and at least maybe to some cases if you\u2019re drifting away, that we get early warnings. But I\u2019m hard pressed unless, Pat\u2019s got a better idea to absolutely quantify how much of that sort of early share, shall we say we\u2019re grabbing. It is very difficult for me to generally answer. We\u2019ll ponder it for you Jeff, unless Matt or Pat has got a better of the tough idea.\nPat Campbell: Jeff, I don\u2019t think we can give you a precise answer numerically, but can probably give you some of your more qualitative. We saw going into the recession that a number of large OEMs wanted to secure a much more reliable supply chain and we saw that really play out through last year as far as gaining new designs. We just didn\u2019t see the volume and so the recovery came. Then I think the flip side is also happening now is that as the economy improves, I think there\u2019s some competitors who were having more difficult time responding. So I think we\u2019re getting some business back on that side, but I say it\u2019s just pretty much across many of our industrial and electronics business, okay. They\u2019ve been very successful and gaining business there.\nJeff Sprague: A separate question, just pick one end market to talk about, maybe if there's others you want to elaborate on, but the push into labels, what you are doing with A1? How significant is that market opportunity, and how should we think about the rollout there over the next six to 12 months?\nGeorge Buckley: I think, Jeff that market for labels is of the order, $0.5 billion a year and A1s, $80 million or so I think it's a very nice marketplace clearly and actually would expect 3M is the innovative in that area. So I think it's a nice adjacency very much close to (inaudible) material science. So I think it obviously depends on the end market reaction and those successful at getting competitive convergence in the marketplace, and there\u2019s some tough competition, but I think that we will be successful in that market not only in the coming year, but I think ultimately innovation and great services going to be the difference. So I think is going to be a good market structure.\nOperator: And your next question is from the line of Terry Darling of Goldman Sachs.\nTerry Darling: I wondering if I could understand some of the pieces of guidance a little bit better maybe come at it from a couple of different angles. The first one would just be very simplistically, if you take your first quarter earnings by four, it's at the high end of guidance. But we\u2019re building momentum, March versus January, February. Can you just take us through your thinking on cadence quarterly earnings, cadence throughout the year? I guess your comments would lead me to think you think that the second quarter is up from the first, but maybe the second half is down, at least as implied by the guidance there, maybe start with that?\nPat Campbell: Terry you\u2019re trying to attract me back into quarterly guidance ago, which you know we are not going to do, but let me try to give you little bit of flavor. You can take our first quarter you're annualizing okay, you kind to get to the high-end of the ranges one way of approaching. and of course, yes, some unusual thing, Q1 we got the stock option expands a hiss that okay and we actually at a lower tax rate okay in Q1 those have tendency kind of offset. But do expect that our normal trend would be that our Q2, Q3 are higher okay than Q1, Q4, it will kind of a normal, kind of course we advance the way that we will see it. Now of course the comps are going to get from a reporting standpoint a little bit unusual here because of course the second quarter was weaker last year than as with the year progressed at the back end of 2009, ended up with some stronger periods and of course, we had a very strong performance in the back half of the year well to the H1N1 demand both on the top line, which were probably impact on our comp assure by about a point now from the back half of the year from a revenue perspective and obviously from a earning standpoint, well. But do expect that generally speaking Q2, Q3 okay should run probably a little bit ahead of the Q1 and then Q4 naturally would have a tendency to fall off a little bit off of Q3, Q4. So I don't see ending this highly unusual this year from kind of a traditional seasonality perspective.\nTerry Darling: From another angle trying to understand what\u2019s implied in the incremental margins and guidance? If I take the high end of the range on our EPS and kind of the low end of the range on organic and I kind of look at what the incremental were implied for the rest of the year versus 2Q versus 4Q of last year. Kind of looks like, 17%, 20% incremental margin. You mentioned a couple other factors in there, I just want to make sure I\u2019m clear on what you\u2019ve changed on some of these items. I think I heard you say it, you\u2019re taking R&D up $100 million versus previous?\nPat Campbell: Yes, I guess Terry two things, one is: let\u2019s start with the year as a total. For the year, when you look at our change of the top line, bottom line effectively our incremental margins in that 35% to 40% range which is kind of our long-term rate that we have been running to in kind of guide to of course we did a little bit better in the first quarter. What we said is that some of our new growth investments which will start to kick in back towards the back half for the year. We had already talked about maybe $115 million going into the year. We said that we will probably invest another $40 million or so in George\u2019s comments he kind of wrapped R&D together okay and talked about $100 million increase in R&D across this new growth programs would be part of it. So that\u2019s part of the impact that will hits on kind of an incremental basis on going forward basis, and also remember that starting with the second quarter we will re-launch somewhere compensation related programs like merit plans and so forth that we had kind of frozen for the last year. So if you look at the top line and bottom line is more reflective of point through our operating margin okay, level is for the back half of the year.\nTerry Darling: Has anything changed on that the raw material price, raw material spread assumptions?\nPat Campbell: I would say not change hugely, you should expect that mature cost will start kicking up here in Q2 on us, but that has been in our plan. Of course we have some very aggressive cost reduction program on the material side as well try to offset as much of this possible. So I would not put it as a significant change from our prior expectations?\nTerry Darling: I wasn't exactly clear on the H1N1 delta. Maybe just tell us what you are now looking for that business to be down in total for the year maybe.\nPat Campbell: Okay, I\u2019ll describe give you order of magnitude more than likely our 2010 level would be in the $100 million of range revenue. Last year we did about $250. So, of course you got a significant change will be first half of this year and Arroyo was last half of last is on the impact. So, you get a benefit of first and second quarter of this year and then really you get kind of the deterioration in the back half of next year turns.\nMatt Ginter: Terry, we had each of the third and fourth quarter about roughly $90 million to $95 million of each one and one related sales last year. So, that\u2019s the 1.5 point drag the George refer to even the second half of this year.\nPat Campbell: I think, again offset by an unknown amount of the industrial recommend we should not factor into numbers, which we help, and we do have a very nice new product program where we are getting ready to launch and my compensate some of that volumes. So, we need to be pessimistic on that but I think we are trying to tell you the best of we know on the profile those sales of the year.\nTerry Darling: I'll ask one more and get out of the way here. D&G margins were one of the big upsides here in the first quarter. If we go back historically, you\u2019ve gotten those as high as 30% plus. It doesn\u2019t sound like you see inventory as a problem there, George.\nGeorge Buckley: No.\nTerry Darling: What keeps us from continuing to track higher with those margins?\nPat Campbell: Right, well first of all you are not going to track higher business, we are not going to go back to the margins that we had three to five years ago just a dynamics that industry will not allow that to happen. And I think when you look at the margins of the D&G had 24% margins in that collective businesses is a very good result, and it realistically as well as optical business maintain stronger, which we expected to do here in the near future, will be able to run it those kind of rates.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies & Company\nLaurence Alexander: Two quick questions on your growth rate. First, as you look at doubling your growth rate assumption for this year, how much of that change in perspective was driven by your electronics exposure? And secondly, as you think longer term, how much of the market share gains on the retail side do you think is permanent versus transitory?\nPat Campbell: Well, I guess on the retail side still has been more permanent I don't see those beings a transitory change in all large, and I guess I haven't looked that the change in guidance by end market per se, I guess if you just look that plus taking our guidance by five points you could argue that maybe 30% to 40% of that probably is kind to be electronics related, that would be a little bit higher than what our total businesses okay, in electronics, but when you look that I think were the growth rate is so forth is cross some more businesses that probably be a kind of more than order magnitude number Lawrence.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Bob Cornell with Barclays Capital.\nBob Cornell: Thanks. You had to put up a good quarter for me, I appreciate it. I think we get did message. The $1.40 was great and the guidance may have an element of caution in it. I guess a lot of questions have been asked. I would say in terms of the pyramid pricing, you mentioned traffic as one business that has benefited from the impairment pricing strategy, and maybe you can just comment just broadly across the portfolio how much you saw there?\nPat Campbell: Well, I don\u2019t have a complete number for the pyramid as a whole, George said we would try to dissect the pieces, George, do you want to comment?\nGeorge Buckley: One number we calculated for last year, we though it about $200 million of additional sales that is coming from this manage the pyramid strategy. Of course, we\u2019ve only just started and you can imagine, Bob this is a kind of step wise strategy for us, we have many more areas that we can attack, and I think the figure has been so nice is that we haven\u2019t seen deteriorating by the managed system to get the cost on both products, right. And the pricing expectations have been, I think well managed. So I don\u2019t know if we can expect that to be double this year up to 400, but I think it gives you some kind of sighting shot on what contribution it makes to end this year.\nBob Cornell: Yes, I agree. Looks like you guys are doing a lot right. Looking forward to the following.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein.\nSteven Winoker: First question is around the exceptional growth in Asia-Pac. So it was down 26% last year and core growth up 46% first quarter this year, how much of that was optical system? I know optical system doubled in total but if you sort of looked at it within Asia-Pac I am trying to get it sense for how much Asia- Pacific was really optical related?\nPat Campbell: We\u2019ll have to probably pull that out.\nSteven Winoker: But let me move on to the next question and within the health care margin they had 31:1 and I know you\u2019ve talked about re investment in the second half overall, and lot of it the cost coming back historically. Can you comment is your vision for margins in that business completely consistent with where you guys were when you talked about that in the last four five months?.\nPat Campbell: I think it is Steve what we\u2019ve said is that overall long -term period of time that business maybe in the high yield a high 20s, it\u2019s a great business and the more volume that you have to, it\u2019s a very profitable business, so it's able to maintain the 30% type margin without really starting it, what we\u2019re hoping to do is over time that what we can do is find additional growth investments in that business which may bring us its margins down, but I don\u2019t anticipate that is going to happen over night. There will be more of a gradual change as compared to a kind of a one quarter movement actually. That\u2019s a fantastic business and if you just do the math it's pretty hard to bring that margin down if you got any kind of growth going on.\nGeorge Buckley: Behind the scenes there\u2019s a lot of work going on, moving up business obviously protecting the call that we have that moving up business to at even more advanced footing. So, we\u2019re looking any investments in advance. We\u2019ll care a lot of look on using very advanced mathematics to diagnostics. Taking extracted signals from some of the advances we have been using that so we\u2019re doing some internal development on that looking at least long or possibly two acquisitions in that area. So I think, what you\u2019re going to see is it kind of a bit of a technological mix of more electronics, more software, and more mathematics that will augment the great businesses we already have. Actually, even in some senses kind of repositioning that business a little bit, taking on various areas of Health Care and particularly various areas of the hospital in operating theatres and so and so forth, and putting together a fully integrated set of a product suite products to meet all other needs that consumable needs in particular they\u2019re in those areas. So I think the strategy at the beginning unfold the steps are being taken Steve, it\u2019s a bit of the watch this space, but I\u2019ve given you kind of a little bit of a preview of some of the ways, places that we\u2019re thinking in this business. That\u2019s right I think, you\u2019re going to see margins, I don\u2019t see them dropping below the high 20s, but for time, we will spend more money in that and hopefully this will remain for many, many years, just like great businesses of 3M, it\u2019s a wonderful business.\nMatt Ginter: On your first question, historically, a few years ago virtually all the growth in Asia was optical for a while but this quarter it was quite balanced. Optical was probably a little under third of the growth in Asia-Pacific and the remainder was really spread across the rest of the portfolio.\nSteven Winoker: On pricing, given the big snap back, you talked about it a little bit, I mean what kind of pricing pressures or desperation you\u2019re seeing as volume comes back from the competitive set and you guys are actually facing across the businesses?\nPat Campbell: Steve, I wouldn\u2019t characterize it at all as any kind of an abnormal pressure. I think part of course what you\u2019re seeing is, I think demand has snap back so rapidly here in Q1 in a number of spaces. The biggest concern we\u2019ve had the suppliers and I think others have had is supply capability as much as anything right now, and I think once we get the supply system where it needs to be then obviously, you can get into price discussion, but right now, I think the biggest concern a lot of us have is, can we get product.\nSteven Winoker: You answer to that as you look forward and plan to ?\nPat Campbell: We\u2019re planning kind of a flat pricing environment for the year, this year Steven, we haven\u2019t changed that view.\nSteven Winoker: Lastly on the R&D front, I know you increased spending of $100 million. Sales, it was still far ahead of that thought that you faced a lower percentage of sales on that. As you look forward and sort of temper the growth rates a little bit, your overall R&D spending, would you spend more if you had the right projects at this point? How do you think about funding that? You talked about the $40 million of new investment. How should we think about that?\nGeorge Buckley: In the beginning of the year, we have a process where we look not only at the R&D spend, but because it\u2019s a development spend and we obviously try to make a balanced judgment on how much extra we\u2019re going to invest to make sure that we don\u2019t damage the overall number. So a little bit of sort of a baby bear balancing act. So we have the ideas and what we choose to do in this first quarter, because things are as strong as we accelerated investment. That pattern I think is likely to continue during the year if things stay very, very strong, we will see where else we can do the reinvestment loan, knowing full well that this is an accelerated to our growth. It would cost something in the near term but would be very, very powerful for us in the long term. So I don\u2019t think you should think that we have an idea in fact is the complete opposite, it is one of the real changes in the company as its really gain traction in the this reinvigoration of R&D, these wonderful new ideas are all over the place, and is just a question about privatizing, funding, while at the same time balancing what we do for the market.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Tusa: You talked about some of the temporary costs coming back in into the second quarter. Is that significant, or maybe if you just flesh it out a bit?\nPat Campbell: Steve, I don\u2019t as being significant is obviously manageable within the size of our business and obviously taking into consideration in our guidance for the year, I think on the comp side is about $0.04 to $0.05 on they gone quarterly basis is kind of what we are probably putting back into the system but what we can manage.\nStephen Tusa: Okay and then as far as the earnings that you gave at the beginning of the year which is always very helpful, aside from the obvious things you have already talked about like price cost and some of the organic dynamics, is there anything else in there that is changing in that bridge?\nPat Campbell: I will say the big change Steve as really been in the volume side. If you go back to our December meeting or any other conversation we had is the biggest change in that whole waterfall really has been on the volume side the equation.\nStephen Tusa: Just one last question on the level of growth you saw in the first quarter. Maybe this just because it's picked up in the back half of the year, but seasonally, the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter has at least as things pick up kind of if you look back from '03 to '07, the average increase has been about 4%, and the sequential increase this quarter was about 4%, obviously the comp is tremendously easy and I'm not discounting the growth rates. I mean the growth rates were off the charts year-over-year, no doubt about it, but are we missing something there? Is there another way we should look at this to judge how strong it is, just to judge kind the progression of the economy here?\nPat Campbell: Yes, you got an appropriate comment if you look at kind year-over-year and so forth from a comps standpoint, but Steven really coming off the fourth quarter, you have to remember that fourth quarter was actually a good quarter for us. We had very decent quarter specially vis-\u00e0-vis any kind of the economic indicators in life. So we have seen good sequential change in our business and actually what makes us feel good about actually increase in your guidance for the whole year is really the rate of change that we have had in our business. I don\u2019t see there is anything unusual there at all.\nStephen Tusa: Okay and then one last question, the progression for the rest of the year. Obviously another good second quarter coming on the organic side, and you gave a slide last conference call talking about the second half growth rate at 2% to 4%? Are you bumping up the back half to the second half as well? I'm just curious as to the progression of the organic growth through the rest of the year? And is the fourth quarter positive?\nPat Campbell: Well, it should be positive and just wanted to remind you, back half of the year as Matt had pointed out each one and when we do have kind of headwind about a point and a half in the back half of the year, but we will be positive if you take our guidance and you kind of extrapolate it implies kind of 7% to 10% growth rate through the back half of the year. My guess it kind of anticipate just the concept private be a little bit better in the second quarter that is in the back half of the year but that\u2019s how we are thinking of the business.\nStephen Tusa: Is that 2 to 4 goes up, obviously?\nPat Campbell: Yes, it does.\nGeorge Buckley: Okay, thank you very much everybody. We\u2019ll close our call right now. Thank you very much for listening. We very much appreciate the time you spent with us, and we look forward in talking to you again the next quarter. Thanks everybody."}], "2012": [{"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 4, "year": 2011, "date": "2012-01-26 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, January 26, 2012. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nMatt Ginter: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter business review. With me today are George Buckley, 3M Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Inge Thulin, Chief Operating Officer; and David Meline, Chief Financial Officer. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 2. During today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Let's begin today's review. And I'll turn the program over to David.\nDavid W. Meline: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide #3. First, a brief summary of the fourth quarter, which I felt was a good finish to the year. We drove record sales and good returns and things finished largely as we expected. We once again saw some real strength in our many industrial-oriented businesses, along with steady growth in Consumer and Health Care. On a geographic basis, Latin America and the United States were the fourth quarter stalwarts. Consumer electronics industry continued to adjust production levels during the quarter to better match demand and supply, much as we had described in our third quarter call in October, and again at our December investor meeting in New York. This had an impact on our Display and Graphics and Electro and Communication businesses, particularly within Asia Pacific. The flooding in Thailand hurt fourth quarter sales by an estimated $35 million and an operating profit impact of $20 million, which was in line with our estimates. On the positive side, we recorded $23 million in insurance recoveries related to last year's earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Therefore, from a profit standpoint, these 2 items largely offset one another. We once again drove strong double-digit growth in Central Eastern Europe and the Middle East, which more than offset weakness in the West. We have yet to see significant signs of recovery in Western Europe. Inge will talk more about our businesses in just a minute. Income rose 5% year-on-year and operating margins finished at 19.2%. Free cash flow was $1.2 billion, and we converted 128% of net income to cash, a good result and typical for a fourth quarter at 3M. So the business continues to generate significant profit and cash flow. Finally, in early January, we announced the acquisition of Avery Dennison's office and consumer products business. Inge will describe this in more detail in a moment. Let's take a closer look at sales for the quarter. So please go to Slide #4. Quarterly sales were $7.1 billion, up nearly 6% year-on-year. The combined Latin America/Canada region was up a strong 10%, with organic growth more than offsetting nearly 4 points of negative currency. United States also had an excellent quarter, with 7% organic growth. U.S. organic volumes have now grown for several quarters consecutively. Sales in Asia Pacific rose 3% in the quarter, slower than we have seen in recent quarters. Part of this, of course, was due to consumer electronics, where the market continued to sink bottom. We expect the market to turn positive sometime in the second quarter. Clearly, China was also a factor in the fourth quarter as the Chinese government successfully slowed activity to stem inflation. Our China team anticipates continued below-trend growth in the first half of 2012, with stronger growth returning in the second half. Europe rose 4%, with strength in Middle East, Africa, and Central East Europe more than offsetting weakness in Western Europe. Selling prices rose 2% in the quarter, which exceeded raw material inflation. And for the full year, the net impact was neutral. Acquisitions added 2.3% to sales in the quarter and foreign exchange impacts were basically flat. Please turn to Slide 5 for a more detailed look at our income statement for the quarter. During this period of slower economic growth, we were paying increased attention to protect the bottom line. For example, we have implemented hiring freezes in developed countries and replacements are being limited to key positions that are typically closest to the customers. Our businesses have also triggered contingency plans with respect to indirect costs. These costs total over $4 billion in annual spending for the company. The early results were encouraging, as fourth quarter indirect spending was down both year-on-year and sequentially. So we are getting some traction here. In the fourth quarter, sales rose 6%, gross profit increased 4% and both operating income and earnings per share rose 5%. Operating margins were 19.2%. Volume growth added 0.2% to fourth quarter operating margins. Selling price changes, net of raw material inflation, added 0.8 percentage points and other productivity contributed 0.3%. Higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense hurt margins by 1% and foreign exchange was a 0.5% headwind in the quarter.  SG&A increased 5% in the quarter and R&D costs were down slightly. Recall that in the fourth quarter of 2010, we accelerated the investments to bring forward a number of 2011 growth programs. Given current economic realities, we chose not to repeat this in the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings for the quarter were $1.35 per share, up 5% versus last year's fourth quarter. The tax rate was 26.7% in the quarter versus 25.3% last year, which reduced earnings by $0.03 per share. Conversely, a lower share count added $0.04 a share of benefit in the quarter. Please turn to Slide #6. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.2 billion, up $116 million versus last year's fourth quarter. Income was, of course, up year-on-year and working capital was a net year-on-year benefit in the fourth quarter. CapEx investment was $517 million, consistent with prior year levels. Full year CapEx was $1.4 billion, which was within our original expected range. During the fourth quarter, we converted 128% of net income to free cash flow. We contributed $209 million to our pension and OPEB plans in the quarter, which lowered the conversion rate by 22 percentage points. Note at the bottom of this slide, we intend to contribute $800 million to $1 billion to our pension and OPEB plans in 2012 versus the $600 million that we contributed in 2011. Of the 2012 contribution, $600 million will occur over the first 2 quarters compared to $125 million in the first half of 2011. As a result, free cash flow conversion rates will be lower than historical trends in the first half. We paid $384 million in cash dividends in the quarter, and gross share repurchases were $494 million. Our strong balance sheet enables us to return significant cash to shareholders, and importantly, to continue growing the business through economic ups and downs. Now Inge will address the fourth quarter performance of our business segments. Please go to Slide #7.\nInge G. Thulin: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that our businesses have responded well to the current economic environment, and that was evident in our fourth quarter results. Let's take a closer look at each business, starting with Industrial and Transportation. This business posted outstanding growth in the fourth quarter. Sales grew 14% to $2.4 billion. All businesses within Industrial expanded their sales with double-digit increases in most businesses. All geographic regions drove double-digit sales growth, with Asia Pacific up 17%, the United States up 15%, Europe up 12% and Latin America/Canada up 10%. Organic local currency growth was 8% in the quarter, an impressive result. Acquisitions added another 6% to growth, the 2 largest being Winterthur and Alpha Beta. Winterthur is a Swiss-based technology-rich addition to our abrasives business, specifically in hard-to-grind precision applications. Alpha Beta is a Taiwanese tape manufacturer that strengthens our offerings in the B and C product lines. Both acquisitions are tracking very well versus our expectations. Profits grew by 14% to $472 million. Operating margins were 19.6%, basically flat year-on-year, as the team drove strong productivity to offset the 50 basis point headwind from acquisitions. Also, including in Industrial's profit for the quarter was $20 million of insurance recoveries related to the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. All in all, this was another solid performance for Industrial and Transportation business. Let's now look at Health Care. Sales grew 5% to $1.3 billion. All businesses within Health Care grew their sales, with infection prevention and skin and wound care leading the way. Health Care sales increased across all regions, with Asia Pacific up 11%, Latin America/Canada up 10%, the United States up 5% and Europe up 2%. Operating income in Health Care increased 12% to $389 million and margins were 30.8%. Health Care continues to gain recognition for innovation. Example, 3M ESPE was recently named the most innovative dental company for the seventh consecutive year. Our Health Care team continues to exemplify innovation for 3M. The healthcare industry has its challenges to be sure, austerity in West Europe, for example. But our business continues to deliver excellent results. Now let's go on to Safety, Security and Protection Services business. Sales rose by 9% to $927 million, all of which was organic. We drove double-digit growth in security systems and in personal safety products during the quarter, along with single-digit growth in building and commercial services. Sales decline in the roofing granules business due to channel inventory corrections in the United States.  Looking geographically, sales rose 18% in the United States, 17% in Latin America/Canada and 13% in Asia Pacific. In Europe, sales declined 4%. On the innovation front, this business, for the first time ever, exceeded $1 billion in new product sales in 2011. Operating profit increased 4% to $171 million and operating margins were 18.5% in the quarter. Let's now look at our Display and Graphics segment. Sales were $823 million, a 9% decline year-on-year. Optical film sales in total fell 17% in the quarter, which was all LCD TV-related. Films for battery-powered devices continued to grow nicely. This includes tablets, smartphones and notebooks. Elsewhere in Display and Graphics, sales grew in both commercial graphics and in architectural markets. Sales declined in traffic safety systems, as government highway funding remains weak, particularly in the United States and in Western Europe. On a regional basis, sales declined 1% in the United States and Latin America/Canada, 10% in Europe and 12% in Asia Pacific. Profits in Display and Graphics rose 10% in the quarter as the team drove outstanding productivity. Operating margins increased over 3 points to 19.2%. Moving to Electro and Communications. Sales were $768 million, down 3%, and profits declined 7% to $153 million. Margins for the quarter were very close to 20%. Growth was again lead by electrical markets business and sales were flat year-on-year in telecommunications. Sales in our electronics-related businesses declined high single-digits, reflecting ongoing production adjustments across much of the industry. We expect these adjustments will continue until inventories are back in line with demand. On a geographic basis, sales increased 6% in Latin America/Canada, 5% in the United States and 2% in Europe. Sales declined 9% in Asia Pacific, of course, heavily impacted by electronics. Finally, let's look at the Consumer and Office business. Sales topped $1 billion this quarter, a 6% increase year-on-year. Half of this growth was organic, with particular strength in our do-it-yourself, stationery products, office supplies and home care businesses. We also added 3 points of growth to Consumer and Office this quarter via the recent acquisition of GPI Group. France-based GPI produces tapes, hooks, installation and floor protection products and is an excellent complement to our existing do-it-yourself business. It will help us quickly expand our presence in the European home improvement channels. On a geographic basis, sales grew -- growth was strongest in Europe at 15%, again, boosted by GPI. Sales grew 11% in Asia Pacific, 9% in Latin America and 1% in the United States. Operating income in Consumer and Office increased 2% to $179 million and margins were 17.6%, diluted somewhat by the acquisition. If we back out GPI's results, underlying margins were 18.4%, up 20 basis points versus last year's fourth quarter. Please turn to Slide #8. We were very pleased to announce the acquisition of Avery's consumer and office products business earlier this month. As you know, Avery is a leader in this space with labels, binders and other office products. We anticipate closing sometime during the second half of this year. The acquisition brings several strategic benefits. We gained immediate scale in the United States, as well as several valuable brands including Avery, Hi-Liter and Marks-A-Lot. As you might expect, we plan to bring much-needed innovation to the business. And in the end, customer will benefit through better product, service and value. The purchase price is $550 million cash. As you can see on the slide, the multiples are quite attractive at 0.7x trailing sales and 5.7x trailing EBITDA. We see potential to expand operating margins to around 20% in the out years. We are very excited about this acquisition and look forward to bring new values to our customers. Please turn to Slide #9. To summarize, 2011 was a good year for our company in a challenging environment. We grew sales 11% with double-digit performance in Industrial and Transportation, Safety, Security and Protection Services and Health Care. New products helped fuel growth and we finished the year with 32% NPVI. Sales in developing economies rose 14%, and now represent 34% of the company. We continue to generate premium operating margins, finishing 2011 at nearly 21%. Margin strength was broad-based with all businesses above 20% for the year. Earnings were $5.96 per share, an increase of 6%. We once again generated significant free cash flow of nearly $4 billion and return on invested capital was 20%.  This strong cash flow allowed us to return $4.3 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, up 81% versus 2010. So all in all, there is much to feel good about in 2011 results, and we are well positioned for success again this year. Please turn to Slide 10, where I will summarize our forward outlook. While our plans for 2012 have firmed up since we last spoke with you, we still think it's appropriate to maintain maximum flexibility. We don't know precisely what the global economy will bring this year, so we are managing cost very carefully in the early stages. But maximum flexibility also means capitalizing on opportunities as they arise. The key here is to be ready to act quickly on those opportunities no matter what they are. We know that in uncertain times, innovation is more important than ever. It differentiates great companies from the rest of the pack, so we will preserve key investment in R&D, sales and manufacturing to ensure future growth. We also know that the emerging markets continue to present very promising platforms for growth in the future. Whatever challenges they present today pale in comparison to their opportunities. There is no better example than China, where near-term issues will not affect our investments for long-term success and growth. Sales in China grew 5% in the quarter and 13% x electronics, both clearly below trend. This is a result of several factors. First, the China government is successfully cooling the economy to manage inflation. As David mentioned earlier, our China team anticipate a stronger growth will return in the second half of the year. Second, China's prominence in consumer electronics contributed to our lower growth rate in Q4. And we also expect that to return upward sometime in the middle of the year. Thirdly, the soft economies in Western Europe, for example, continued to affect exports, and it's difficult to gauge exactly when conditions might improve. Overall, we agree with a consensus view that China growth will become more robust as 2012 goes on. But the main point I want to make is this, any temporary troubles are trumped by the magnitude of the China opportunity, and we will continue to invest to create and realize opportunities there. And the same is true for all the developing countries. At our December meeting in New York, we described our financial expectation for 2012. Our outlook has not changed since then. So today, we reaffirm those expectations. We expect that full year 2012 earnings per share will be in the range of $6.25 to $6.50. Including in this range is an estimated $0.09 per share year-on-year increase in pension and postretirement benefits expense. We are estimating organic volume growth between 2% and 5% for the year. We expect that operating margins will be between 21% and 22.5%, with the lower end largely a function of potential one-time costs on acquisitions that might be completed later in the year. This is purely a planning assumption at this point. Finally, we continue to expect a tax rate of 29.5% in 2012. Sales and profit growth will be challenging in the first half of 2012. It is our view that first quarter economic growth will be low and will improve as the year progresses. Underlying these estimates are several factors. Europe, of course, is contracting at the moment. Again, consumer electronics will be tough in early 2012, and we expect to see recovery around mid-year. Optical, in particular, will have its toughest comparison in the first quarter. Finally, we expect to incur cost of $0.04 per share in the first quarter related to a voluntary retirement incentive program in the United States, along with some selective restructuring in a few mature countries. These actions, in aggregate, will be neutral for the full year 2012 earnings, with the cost incurred in Q1 and associated benefits realized over the remainder of the year. That concludes our formal comments today. Now we'll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal from FBR Capital Markets.\nAjay Kejriwal: So just maybe to start with, on the Display and Graphics, margins holding steady at the 19% level despite the top line. And I know you talked about the first quarter inventory challenges. But maybe if you could talk about what margins could look like next year if optical remained at the current level. I know first quarter, there are challenges. But if things come back in the second half, how would margins look like?\nDavid W. Meline: Sure, Ajay. So this is David Meline. First of all, I think to interpret the margin performance in Q4, what you need to think about is the fact that unlike last year in Q4, where we had quite a downtake in our margins, this year we've been facing into what were known headwinds in the business throughout the year. So they've been adjusting their cost base through the year and really operating in a much tougher environment. And therefore, even though in Q4 our utilization in the factories was similar this year to last, the margins were much better because we have a better cost base we've put in place. If we look forward into 2012, we think that optical systems is going to remain under pressure, in particular due to the price environment in the LCD TV business. And we think that the optical business will run closer to the company average, and we think D&G as a sector will be a little bit below where they were in terms of margins in 2011.\nAjay Kejriwal: Good. And then maybe on the cost saving and restructuring initiatives, you talked about the $4 billion in indirect costs. You obviously have some initiatives already in place. Could you maybe talk about what -- whether you're done with the actions that you wanted to put in place for the cost savings or there's more to be done?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes. So first of all, indirect costs at 3M, this is a broad definition of costs. So this includes basically all of our costs, with the exception of material inputs and our people cost compensation and benefits. So broad definition, we were pleased in terms of how we've managed down those costs in a tougher environment. So if you look at discretionary spending, like external costs that we -- for consultants, this type of thing, if you look at travel expenses, if you look at other discretionary items, we've managed that down in obviously a tougher environment for the company. And we expect that to continue in a similar fashion, certainly through the first half and probably through the entire year, depending on how the year develops. So in terms of additional actions, I would say I think you're seeing the kind of environment right now and performance that will continue into 2012.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from Citi Investment Research.\nDeane M. Dray: I might have missed this. Is George on the call this morning?\nMatt Ginter: He is.\nDeane M. Dray: Okay, because my question relates to -- it's a delicate topic, but management succession. And maybe this is more appropriately directed to 3M's board. But I'm surprised there hasn't been more clarity about succession plans at 3M. And if you compare the big industrials, UTX, GE always have these well-signaled transitions, and it's been really frankly ambiguous at 3M. So is this -- does the board not consider this to be a priority? And what comments can you share with us this morning?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Well, Dave, obviously, they do consider it a priority. It's obviously -- must be one of the most important things on their mind. But I think they're trying to figure out what is the best way forward. And we've got a board meeting coming up. I'm sure they'll be considering it at that. And when the appropriate time comes, they'll be letting people know what their decision is. And I don't think there's much else I can say about it because, in a sense, I'm the informed, not the informer, if you know what I mean.\nDeane M. Dray: George, I really appreciate that. I know it's a delicate question. But I just wanted to put it out there that, from our perspective, it's been ambiguous and we'll leave it there. And then in terms of the quarter, I'm trying to reconcile a comment earlier that innovation is important, focusing on new product development is important. But still you've chosen not to invest in R&D in the quarter compared to the spending 1 year ago. So what's the trade-off that you're making today in holding back on what might be incremental growth investments?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes, Deane. I guess, what I would say is that we think that the investments that we've got in place, including in Q4, is certainly perfectly adequate and a very strong level of R&D commitment that the company has. So don't misinterpret what we're showing in Q4 as being us changing our view on the importance to 3M's business model of a very strong R&D investment trend. But obviously, R&D, just like the rest of the areas, as we get into a tougher cost management environment, we've had to temporarily defer some of the things that we'd like to do. We've had to hold down spending just like the rest of the company. But what I can assure you of is we're not throwing overboard important and good opportunities for the business.\nDeane M. Dray: And just last one for me is I know you're not in the quarterly guidance business. But just based upon commentary, it doesn't sound like you're expecting to show EPS growth in the first quarter. Is that fair?\nDavid W. Meline: In terms of EPS growth in the first quarter, if you look, first of all, at the overall business for the year, what we've said is that we're driving to improve our margins by about 1 point for the year, and we expect 2% to 5% organic growth. Obviously, toughest in the first half and in the first quarter. So I think it would be fair to say that we could see a level of performance that would be carryover or even considering this $40 million of items we've got in the first quarter, could even be a little bit below last year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.\nSteven E. Winoker: Just want to get a sense for -- quickly first, that insurance recovery, which I think is like $0.02 to $0.025 per share or so it sounded like, is that it? Or is there more coming?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes, Steve. So that's right, it's $23 million in total, so a little over $0.02 a share in the fourth quarter. We do have more claims that are in and under discussion. And we're very confident that we'll get some more recoveries beyond that. What we don't know is will those recoveries occur now in 2012 or sometime beyond that in 2013. But yes, the answer is we expect some more.\nSteven E. Winoker: Okay. But it sounds like certainly not in the first half of the year, right? Because these are longer-term recoveries now.\nDavid W. Meline: I can't say first half. Second half, what's true is, I think importantly, we expect to get some recoveries, but we don't have that explicitly built into the plan right now.\nSteven E. Winoker: Okay. And that $0.06 of Avery Dennison dilution, is that -- that is baked into your $6.25 to $6.50 guidance?\nDavid W. Meline: No, it's not.\nSteven E. Winoker: Okay. So that's in addition -- that would be -- okay -- separate from the...\nDavid W. Meline: That would impact -- and obviously, depending on when it occurs, we'll also have the positive impact of the underlying performance of the business. So what we -- we want to leave that out until we get a better visibility on the timing of the closing.\nSteven E. Winoker: Okay. And then on pricing. So 200 basis points with significant move-up in several of the businesses and sounds familiar to the '09 experience, where you really were able to drive pricing to hold margins and drive margins. How should we think about this time relative to that time? What's different, sustainability? Any particular areas that you would call out would be helpful.\nDavid W. Meline: Yes, in terms of pricing, to be honest, you're right. We've had to push hard in this environment, particularly driven by the kind of cost inflation that we saw in 2011. As we mentioned in December, we do expect to see certainly more modest -- but in certain commodities, we expect some cost pressure on us again in 2012. So that's part of our planning. But we don't see any reason why, as was the case in 2009, that we can't hold on to our price. If you look at the business model, it's very much driven by innovation and having fresh product that's attractive to our customers. And therefore, our experience is typically we can hold price once we put that through.\nSteven E. Winoker: Right. So this is not -- this is still more a function of material and commodity-driven escalators as opposed to new products and mix?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes, I would say -- well, we always have new products, which enables us to hold price and hold margin, right? So in some way, that's in the base. And then the type of extraordinary pricing push we've put on, including now, we're seeing the real benefits of it in Q4. And certainly, we worked to offset the raw material cost inflation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura Securities.\nShannon O'Callaghan: When you think about these dynamics in your consumer electronics Europe, putting price aside and just looking at kind of core volume growth, right? It was up 1.3% in the quarter. These pressures in the first half, are they incremental pressure on top of what you're already seeing? I mean, are core volumes going to get tougher before they get better? Maybe how to calibrate a little bit how this plays out as we enter '12.\nDavid W. Meline: Yes. So if you look at -- and we can talk about segments. But if you look at the overall volume trend, what we observed in Q4 was very similar in total to what we saw in Q3. And so our perception right now as a -- on a total overall basis, is that we found the bottom across the various areas where we're seeing pressure, that being Western Europe, that being in the consumer electronics business. We do think that we will continue at this lower level of activity, as we said, through the first quarter and through the first half of the year at some level. So I guess, what I would leave you with is our sense right now is that we are stabilizing here on an overall basis. And barring an economic crisis, which we don't have in our plans, we would say eventually, the next step would be a level of recovery for the business.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Okay. And then just on this Avery deal, kind of interesting. I mean, the deals you guys have done recently have been sort of growthier, I guess, I would say. And I know this is trying to reinvent the category or revitalize the category, I guess. But it's a lower multiple, more kind of cost synergy-related type deal. I mean, is that -- might we see more of those types of deals versus sort of more growth-oriented acquisitions?\nInge G. Thulin: Well -- this is Inge. Acquisitions will come in many shapes and forms. And maybe this could be viewed as slightly different than the ones we have done before. However, this -- in this business, scales matter, and this is very important for us in order to be able to build out opposition in that market. So this, we believe that this is very good because we will be able to add innovation to that business. We would be able to streamline our supply chain, mainly we will be able to give better services. And I think, overall, this is good for our customers and also for the shareholders, of course. So I think generally speaking, that it's slightly different, it's very much U.S.-based. But in this business, scales matter and we will be able to add a lot of value to our customers. We will also, with this business, be able to expand outside of United States. So we think, overall, this is a good addition for our Consumer and Office business. And it's a core for 3M. We know how to do this and have done it very well in the past.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Yes. No, I agree, it looks good. Obviously, I guess, I was just curious in terms of your pipeline of deals. Are there more things like this, where it's sort of a lower-priced deal where can add scale to something you already have versus maybe expanding into some new growthier areas that you're not currently directly in?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes, if I could, Shannon. What I -- take away from this is that we haven't changed our approach in terms of the pipeline. We're still interested in, not only deals like this that add scale and leverage, but importantly, we think that to continue to have a chance to grow the business as we foresee doing, that we're also looking and will continue to look at transactions that involve businesses that might help our growth rate.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nAbhiram Rajendran: This is Abhi Rajendran calling in for John. Could you talk a little bit about your expectations for the linearity of volumes through the course of 2012? Are you expecting an incremental pickup through the course of the year? Or is there a bigger step-up baked in for the second half potentially?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes. So what I would say is if you look at the volume trend, just like the outlook for the economy, we do see a rising volume trend in the second half, which would be a combination of both the way the economy's developing. If you look at Western Europe, Global Insight, for example, it's calling for a positive economic growth by the fourth quarter. If you look at the electronics business, which is impacting us, that obviously has some very dynamic features to a correction, which are a very hard and fast trend down. And typically, a recovery also looks like that, which is a pretty vertical recovery. So depending on the segment, I think it's fair to say that we would expect to see some acceleration in the second half. And the other element of that, which we've talked about in the past is if you look at the inventory cycle, that's a very relevant impact on our business. So if you look at our reported volume in Q4, it was about 1%. But we believe that if you adjust for inventory, it would have been closer to 5%. So if you think about that inventory cycle, we expect that, that, too, would then be reversing as we move through 2012.\nAbhiram Rajendran: Okay, great. And just a quick follow-up, excluding the acquisition effect, margins in Consumer and Office were basically flattish year-over-year despite the top line growth. Was this driven by some heightened spending? Or was there any other factor driving this? And also, how are you thinking about margins in 2012, including the potential addition of Avery's business?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes. So you got it right, which is that if you look at the margin year-over-year, it was down. But excluding the acquisition, it was flat to up a little bit. We do expect -- it's a tough consumer environment out there right now, in particular in the emerging -- in the mature markets where we have the biggest presence. So what we expect is that kind of a tough environment will continue. And if I think about 2012 margins in Consumer, I expect they'll be pretty flat with 2011.\nMatt Ginter: And Abhi, just to reiterate, you asked about Avery. Any impacts from Avery are not in our guidance at this point in time. So as we get closer to close, we'll provide some more insight there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays Capital.\nScott R. Davis: Wanted to go back to Avery and see if we can dig in a little bit more detail. I mean, a couple of questions. I mean, when I look at the initial guidance, it seems relatively conservative, at least as back of the envelope. I would imagine there's some dual capacity and dual warehousing and stuff that would be fairly easy to take out. So I'd love to get your view there. Second, are there any other limitations on what you can do with the brand, given that Avery Dennison does still exists as a company? Are there any limitations as far as how far you can -- whether you could expand this brand out in other SKUs?\nInge G. Thulin: Yes, we are asked in the due diligence relative to what we can as we move ahead. So I think one thing is we are going to be careful in terms of any comments due to the regulatory we are under at this point in time. But as we have looked upon it, we believe that in that specific market around office supplies, that we can capitalize on those brands and be able to build it out. Of course, in terms of cost synergies, there is -- we expect quite a bit that we'll be able to do. And that will be a good benefit for us, both in terms of manufacturing and supply and how we go to market. So we believe that our strong brands that we were able to capitalize on, there is a very good commercialization machine in 3M today that would be able to take those products and commercialize them in a more effective way and a more cost-effective way. And then of course, the whole supply chain will be streamlined as we go ahead here.\nScott R. Davis: So are there limitations with what you can do with the brand? I guess, I wasn't clear.\nInge G. Thulin: No, there is no limitation on what we can do with the brand.\nScott R. Davis: Okay, great. Second question is just related to R&D. And it's -- I think if you take a look back at the last 20 years or so at 3M, there's been varying levels of spend, mostly around that 5% of sales level, but varying levels above and beyond, give or take 100 basis points. Has there been any analysis done into kind of what is the optimal rate? I mean what is the rate where you are able to outgrow peers, hold on to your margins and earn an appropriate return for shareholders? I mean, I'm just curious to see if there's been a real analysis of that or if there's any way to really measure that, the ideal spend.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Scott, it's George here. Maybe I'll take a crack at that for you. We have, in fact, done some of what you suggest. There's always this question that hangs over the effectiveness of R&D. And I'd like to make 2 or 3 points. R&D spend goes up and down, depending on what we -- we may have some external projects that we fund. So you shouldn't really imagine that R&D spend would be perfectly flat all the way through the year, or for that fact, monotonically increasing every year. So there's that kind of variability mixed into the equation. But coming back to your point about the effectiveness of R&D, it's quite interesting that we really don't spend anything more in terms of as a percent of sale. If you take out the pharmaceutical business -- when I came to the company, we picked up spend and it sort of flattened and we've kept it in that similar sort of percentage of sales number all of the intervening years. But what has happened is this New Product Vitality Index, especially in the core, has somewhere between doubled and tripled. So the effectiveness of R&D has become very, very strong, and it's a big -- as David said earlier, what a lot of people perhaps overlook is the impact of these inventory corrections in the second half of our results from last year. The underlying growth is still very, very strong, and we expect it to continue. So whether anybody could ever answer the question, \"What's the optimum spend?\" But if you speculate in your mind and you look forward at the plans that we have for driving this NPVI, and the kind of way we think about it is we separate this Class 3, which is current replacement stuff, that's offsetting natural attrition and the balance of that. So today, this year, the number will be about 32% for the year, net-net, 15% in this sort of [indiscernible] and 17% in new products. You can kind of just get a rough idea of the growth rate which is underlying by just dividing that. It's not absolutely accurate. Just by dividing the -- 32 minus 15 equals 17 divided by 5, gets you 3.4%. So you know that, that's what's the underlying growth in the company. And now where would it be the right thing to do? I think -- we think that right now, we can see our way to around 40%. And that's what we need to get to that underlying organic growth rate that Pat and I talked about what seems like all those many years ago. So I think it's in that range. And the interesting thing then will be where should spend go? Should we -- can we flatten it out? Can we reinvest? Should we hold the investment at that level and the growth rate to that level? That's a ways away, but I think the thing -- the observation we can make is the impact of R&D and the efficiency of R&D has just gone up tremendously in 3M in these intervening years. And that's probably the thing that we ought to focus on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.\nJeffrey T. Sprague: I'm just wondering if we could dig a little further into Display and Graphics, and just a couple of questions. First, can you just ground is on where you ended '11 on your mix in optical between -- however you have it, but I'm thinking kind of TV, battery devices and other, just thinking about kind of that crossover point.\nDavid W. Meline: Sure, Jeff. So if you look at the mix overall, first, for the calendar year '11, it was 53% battery and 47% plug-in. If you look at the mix in the fourth quarter, specifically, it had risen to 58% battery and 42% plug-in. So -- and as we've talked about going to somewhere 2/3 to 3/4 of battery next year, so very much on that trend line that we've laid out in December.\nJeffrey T. Sprague: All right. And that's a revenue number?\nDavid W. Meline: That is revenue.\nJeffrey T. Sprague: And can you tell us where you ended the year on attachment rates for LCD TV?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes, we were -- in the fourth quarter, we were running at about 20%. And we think next year in our plans, we're expecting attached to run between 15% and 20%.\nJeffrey T. Sprague: Okay. And just one other detail question, and I'll pass it on. Commercial graphics and architecture, you pointed to that. Do you discern any particular turn or pickup in commercial construction activity? Was there something unusual going on there? Just any color on that nuance in the segment.\nInge G. Thulin: Yes. Well, commercial graphics is broad-based, as you know, in terms of both personalization and corporate identity programs. And that's going very well, and we are expanding very well in that area specifically. Architecture is a new business, a new investment for us, where we make very good inroad, which means that despite how construction is doing overall, we are able to go into that market and take market share and build our businesses. What's interesting for us is that commercial graphics is often a business that we're given early indicator of down or upturn in the economy, and we have not seen a downturn. And in fact, we're doing very, very well. I think one of the reason is this new personalization program that have been introduced, which was one of them -- when we talked earlier and David made a comment earlier, some investment that we did in the end of the year 2010 in terms of accelerated programs, 2 of the programs that was done there, one was in personalization for commercial graphics and the other one was around labels. So I see now that those programs are really taking off for us and we have really some good momentum going there. So that is the perspective on commercial graphics specifically. So that was early investment, and it's paying off now all over the world actually, as those programs start now to roll out in commercial graphics, specifically on the personalization side.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line on Terry Darling of Goldman Sachs.\nTerry Darling: Dave, wondering if we could talk a little bit more about the nice improvement in pricing again. And I think in the past, sometimes you've given us a breakdown between the electronics businesses and the others. If that's not available, I'm wondering if you can talk about which segments maybe benefited the most on a sequential basis from that improvement.\nDavid W. Meline: Right. So in terms of pricing, yes. I mean, as you observed, we were very pleased with the results. We've been working on this, obviously, through the year. And to see the 2% number print for us in the fourth quarter was very encouraging. If you look at pricing in the quarter x electronics, that was actually 2.7%. So not atypical of the electronics business. We did have price down in particular in optical systems, which impacted us there. In terms of where we have the most significant price improvements, it was most in the areas where we had the most cost pressure, which was more on the industrial side of the business.\nTerry Darling: Okay. And do you have that breakout for 3Q by any chance? I'm sorry, between electrical and nonelectrical? I'm just trying to -- the sequential improvement, was that just electrical getting less negative? Or did the industrial side actually pick up significantly to drive that? Or maybe it was a bit of both.\nMatt Ginter: Terry, electronics, generally speaking, is about a 1 point impact on total price change for the company. So I don't think it changed that much really, Q3 versus Q4.\nTerry Darling: Okay. And what is the price improvement assumption for 2012?\nDavid W. Meline: We've got 0 to 1 in terms of price in 2012.\nTerry Darling: Okay, that's helpful. And then on the strong Health Care margins in the fourth quarter. I mean, maybe backing up, David, I guess, the question, is it relative to where you guys were in December as we think about your organic growth range for the year? Can you just refresh comments on segments above and below kind of the midpoint of that range? And has anything changed there?\nDavid W. Meline: This is on a volume discussion or on margins?\nTerry Darling: Yes. Why don't we just talk about the volume discussion?\nDavid W. Meline: Volume. So yes, so if you think about the ranges that we provided in December for 2012, we don't see any reason to be thinking differently about those trends as we finish Q4 and move into the first half. Obviously, while those trends indicate full year figures, we're certainly thinking, as I said earlier, that Q4 and Q1 are not going to look terribly different in terms of the volume momentum overall.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.\nDavid L. Begleiter: David, could you -- any views on China post the new year? Any visibility yet into your order patterns or order books in that region?\nInge G. Thulin: Yes, this is Inge. What we see, as I laid out earlier, we -- there's 3 things that affected the growth in Q4. And I think most of what was built up for the Chinese New Year came in, in Q4, and we have seen a little bit of uptick in the beginning. But it's too early in this quarter to talk about the orders' inflow in China and the impact for the quarter. But I think the 3 things, as I said earlier, that made the result for China was the successful execution of the government to slow the economy in order to manage inflation. It's clearly the economic environment, overly in terms of exports going over to Europe and United States. But specifically, to Europe, as that now stands for 19% of the exports out of China. And then the prominence in the electronic industry also made, that there was a little bit of slowdown. But as both David and myself and George talked about here earlier, we see all those 3 things type of moving up as the year progresses. But it looked like Q1 for China would be very similar to Q4 as it looks like now.\nDavid L. Begleiter: And just lastly on raw materials, we see a number of your chemical commodity prices come down, but you're still looking for raws to be up year-over-year. Where are you seeing or expect to be seeing inflation in raw materials in 2012?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes. The areas where we see it -- some of our chemicals still are experiencing some level of inflation. Resins as well rubber and rare earth materials are the most prominent areas of cost pressure for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.\nC. Stephen Tusa: Just a question on Health Care. Very strong margin there. And sequentially, I think revenues are flat but the profits were up. What's going on there? Is there a mix issue or something else? And what's the longer-term view on Health Care margin?\nDavid W. Meline: Sure. Yes, I mean, the fact is, is that Health Care, just like the rest of the business, we've gone into a fairly tough environment where we are marshaling our resources and really focusing on managing cost. So as we've talked about pretty consistently, we believe the sweet spot for the businesses is in the high 20s. But from quarter-to-quarter, you're going to see this thing move up and down a bit. So this quarter, we had about 1 point of pickup. Does that again signal that we've got a different view of Health Care going forward in their margins? I would say not at all. What's true is we're seeing very good performance in some of the sectors. So for example, in infection prevention, is having strong performance, skin and wound care as well, which is also helping the results.\nC. Stephen Tusa: What's your most positive margin just directionally? What's your favorite business there, margin-wise?\nDavid W. Meline: Actually, Health Care's portfolio is all pretty profitable.\nC. Stephen Tusa: Got you, so no rebuttification [ph]. One last question, just on the sequencing of the quarter. We've heard a lot about November maybe being a little bit weak. You guys seem a little bit better on your -- on the tone of the economy. Did you see anything change kind of second half of December or towards the end of the year maybe into this year?\nDavid W. Meline: No, we didn't see any new inflection point. Obviously, we like -- the market was looking at 3M and looking for where we're stabilizing, and we're pleased to see that, that occurred in Q4. But as I said earlier, we think now, unfortunately, we're in a fairly weak environment at least through the first quarter.\nInge G. Thulin: I would like, yes, to make one additional comment relative to Health Care because I think there's a couple of elements there that is working very well and is overall based on the strategy for the company. First of all, in infection prevention, this Arizant acquisition that was down last year is playing out very, very well for us. And then in addition, we have introduced some new products here, specifically the new silicon tape that is making a big difference in the market. So many things in Health Care is going on in terms of both driving productivity in the commercialization part but also the execution of the acquisitions they have done and new product introduction, specifically then in wound and skin health. So I think that all those elements is driving good margins for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.\nNigel Coe: Just wanted to -- one of the big headlines to come out of the CES show this year was the introduction of some OLED screens, primarily in the TV market. How does the transition from LCD to OLEDs change the game for your films business?\nInge G. Thulin: Well, we see OLED, of course, coming on. And we don't have any big impact as we go into 2012. In fact, we see with some of the innovation that we are working on in our laboratories that could be an advantage for us because the LED segment need to respond to it. So again, in that segment overall, the important thing is to have innovation so you can meet a competitive threat, and for us -- it's for us to be able to provide our customers with alternatives. And I say a couple of very, very good programs going on that will help them to be able to defend their position. Overall, in that segment, which is the same for -- if you think about some of the Display and Graphics businesses, but also Electro and Communications is that's a very good space for us to be in due to the fact it's about technology innovation and cost out. And that is what 3M does very well. And both those businesses have very high NPVI. I think Electro and Communications is the highest in the company of over 42%. Meaning, as they now develop new platforms for the future, we are there working with them because that is the future for us.\nNigel Coe: Okay. And then just a follow-on. George has talked a lot about inventory adjustments in the past. And you're obviously seeing some pretty big inventory adjustments in Electro and also in films. Can you just maybe describe what you're seeing as far as inventory reductions right now, perhaps focusing on China and Europe? And which businesses are you seeing the most severe inventory adjustments?\nInge G. Thulin: Yes. I think that one thing we see that, generally, inventory levels have reset to healthy levels. And when you go in, as you talk specifically around film businesses for Electro and Communications and optical, they are now at 5 to 6 weeks in the channel. So when we talk to our customers and when we get the information from our own business heads here, its inventory levels have reset to a more healthy level.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies & Company.\nLaurence Alexander: Two quick questions on asset footprints. First, what kind of deceleration or deterioration in the longer-term growth rates in Europe would you need to, say, to significantly rationalize your European footprints? And secondly, George, over the years, you've made several remarks about the need to shift the business model towards more of a solutions mindset with a lot more information technology intensity. Do you think that, that's something which the company needs to do more aggressively over the next few years in terms of larger-scale M&A? Or do you think it's -- or do you think that's within 3M's own skill set?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Yes, Laurence, it's George here. You seem sort of -- if you think about sort of what has really affected your life in the last 10 years, I mean, there's all sorts of different things. But probably 70% of the impact on your life was electronics. And the things you carry in your bags, the things you have on your desk, and so on, so forth, communications. So I don't expect that pattern to change. There are some other supporting things that we don't have time now to go over. But what we've done is sort of gradually cede this into the company, and you'll see in the makeup of the company's products, more and more electronics, more and more software-oriented businesses. I expect this pattern to continue. Whether I'd want to sort of recommend to anybody, to the board in particular, that we make a big -- a very expensive software acquisition because these things tend to be for us much more sort of engineering-oriented. We have a good group in the company already that does that. We'd expand that probably organically. So I don't expect to see any sort of big leapfrog acquisitions in software, Laurence. On Europe, Europe generally speaking as an area has had lower growth than pretty much any of the other areas that we have in the world. These economic cycles come and they go. This one will be the same. I think there's been a trend in our company just progressively to push down and really demand more productivity in Europe. That won't change. I don't think there's going to be any, again, any cataclysmic restructuring program in Europe. We'll just continue to drive it down. Just one last sort of comment. If you just think about attrition in its own right, we attrited around 5% a year. So we can get some pretty good productivity out of that, notwithstanding having to -- not all skills are fungible. So I think it's going to be largely attrition-driven and probably specific issues from time to time, squeaky wheels that we oil, and that's probably about the way that we'll likely handle it.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of John Roberts of Buckingham Research.\nJohn E. Roberts: George, I noticed on the Display and Graphics segment, you got actually a win with your new Power-Over-Ethernet film. Does that drive your content back on to power devices?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Well, very interesting, I -- you have to -- I think the people are going to be very interested in this as it continues to push down on energy. The rate of adoption, obviously, we don't know. It's a new product, we'll have to see. But I think it's a very interesting product. And I suspect it will drive up the content, and particularly, in monitors and all-in-ones as we go forward. So I'm pretty optimistic and pretty upbeat about that. So I suspect, without me getting into the forecasting business on that one product line in that one segment, I think it's going to be a nice lift for the business as the year unfolds and more people adopt it.\nJohn E. Roberts: Is it similar content for device as your optical film?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Well, similar charges per square meter, yes. And a few other bits and pieces, of course, that we get along with that sale through that innovation. So probably content will go up a little bit.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.\nMatt Ginter: Well, thanks for joining us today, everybody. Good questions. And we look forward to talking to you as the year goes on. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line."}, {"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 3, "year": 2011, "date": "2011-10-25 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, October 25, 2011. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nMatt Ginter: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, I've got 2 items just to mention. First, please plan to attend our Annual Outlook Meeting scheduled for the morning of Tuesday, December 6 at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York City. An invitation will go out today. Second, we will announce fourth quarter earnings on January 26, so please mark your calendars. Today, we'll discuss our third quarter results, along with an updated outlook for the remainder of this year. The slide presentation and audio replay will be archived on our website for an extended period. With me today are George Buckley, 3M Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Inge Thulin, Chief Operation Officer; and David Meline, Chief Financial Officer. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements on Slide 2. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. So with that, I will turn the program over to George.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Hi. Good morning, everybody, and welcome. Well, today, David Inge will lead the majority of the formal pieces of the call, but by way of a setup, I'd like to offer a few words at the beginning of the call. The quarter turned out to be very different one than what we expected. The challenges that we faced were primarily 2 causes and 2 effects focus. Cause #1 was words about European sovereign debt and the European economy. Cause #2, was the rapid contraction of the electronics end markets. It began with TV, extended to all the consumer devices and has now crept a bit into factory automation. Effect #1 was a flip in exchange rates as confidence in Europe's ability or willingness to deal with the crisis fell and its economy responded negatively. Foreign-exchange alone will reduce our earnings by up to $0.07 over the balance of Q4. This is the reverse side of having almost 70% U.S. sales outside of the United States. On the second effect, this was simply volume and the under absorption that comes along with it. In the last few months, worldwide IPI forecast for 2011 have fallen by 4,200 basis points. This a reset down in expectations of the global economy. Those who know our company well know 2 things always happen in these circumstances. First, that change is always amplified in the supply chain, temporarily suppressing net growth. And second, we always see the effect early, typically 1 to 2 quarters before our industrial peers. Without these factors or transients, our underlying organic growth would have been almost 6%, so underlying fundamentals are okay. The best in news is this: Electronics markets always recover quickly and early from these types of slash contractions, as do we. With that introduction, I'd like to turn the call over now to David to begin with the details. David?\nDavid W. Meline: Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Page #3. I'm going to start today with a few brief comments on the quarter, along with discussion of our current macro view, which has changed since the second quarter call. At the time of our July earnings call, the late quarter data was hinting that global economic growth was beginning to moderate. We felt it in our results and described it as such. But at that early point, it was difficult to ascertain the extent to which that softness might extend into Q3. Signs indicated this was temporary, and that better growth rates would resume in the second half of the year. Japan, of course, further clouded the picture. In this quarter's results, you will see that several of our businesses grew nicely. We posted worldwide sales of $7.5 billion, a 10% increase over last year's third quarter, and notably, a record for any third quarter in our history. 3 of our 6 businesses posted double-digit increases, namely Industrial and Transportation, Safety Security and Protection and Health Care and our Consumer business expanded their sales as well. Growth in these 4 segments was achieved through a combination of good organic volume, selling price increases and acquisitions, along with a dose of positive currency benefit. So while there is definitely growth to be had in this economy, certain segments clearly hit an inflection point in the quarter and some retreated. Western Europe is experiencing challenges given the uncertainty around fiscal and monetary policy direction. This is impacting consumer confidence and spreading to the manufacturing sector. Our organic volumes in Western Europe declined 4% in the third quarter after a flat results in the second quarter and a 4% increase in the first. The consumer electronics markets, excluding handhelds, slowed considerably as the third quarter progressed, which impacted our sales in Electro and Communications, and we also saw it creeping into factory automation too. We sell a broad array of component solutions to all types of electronic OEMs and roughly 1/2 of this business's sales go to the electronics industry. We know from history that electronic cycles are fast so volume declines are deep and short. But the good news is, is they also normalize quickly. In Display and Graphics, LCD TV remains the story, as OEMs are fighting a battle to lower prices, reduce inventories, and yet still create value for retail customers. By and large, with the exception of Consumer and Office and Health Care, we are a component supplier to our customers. Our products are generally consumed in our customer's manufacturing processes or embedded in the customer's end products. So our business is fairly short cycle. This means that when economic trends turn down, our customers alter production schedules and we feel the impact sooner than most. And those changes are nearly always accompanied by temporary inventory transients, which amplify the impact on our sales. Bear in mind this phenomena works in both directions. When the economy turns back up, volumes recover sooner and our growth is amplified as the channel fills again. We've been through these corrections many times in our past, and we know how to respond. Inge will speak more to this in a few minute moments. With that brief intro, I would like to now turn call over to Inge who will review the quarterly performance of our 6 business segments. Please turn to Slide #4.\nInge G. Thulin: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. While there is no doubt the environment is changing somewhat, there's a lot for us to feel good about in the third quarter. 5 of our 6 businesses achieved positive sales growth with 3 delivering double-digit growth and we posted an all-time record for third quarter sales. Now, let's take a closer look at each business, starting with Industrial and Transportation, our biggest business. Third quarter sales were up a solid 19% to $2.6 billion or 15% in local currency terms. Sales grew across all businesses, with double-digit increases in Abrasives, Renewable Energy, Aerospace and Industrial Adhesives and Tapes. Geographically, growth was broad-based, with sales up 28% in Asia Pacific, 22% in Europe, 15% in Latin America/Canada and 10% in the United States. Acquisitions contributed 6.8% to growth. Winterthur, one of our larger acquisition in this space, is a tremendous addition to our core Abrasives business. It is a technology-rich company in the area of bonded abrasives for hard to grind precision applications in industrial, automotive, aircraft and cutting tool markets. We have long admired Winterthur's technical capability, and we are very excited about the combination of our 2 companies. The integration is well underway and on track. Some of our businesses in Industrial and Transportation were affected by the slowing economic activity. For example, the Industrial Adhesives and Tapes business, which sells across most industries, including electronics, was particularly impacted. In our Industrial and Transportation business, profits grew by 21% to $525 million, with a high respectable operating margin of 20.4%. All in all, it was another solid performance for this business, which represent 1/3 of our global business mix. Let's move on to Health Care. Sales grew 14% to $1.2 billion or nearly 11% in local currency. The strongest growth came from our Infection Prevention business, which drove outstanding high single-digit organic growth in the quarter in addition to a nice boost from the recent acquisition. We acquired this company one year ago and so far, it has been a home run. Early indication saw that patient warming solutions for the operating room were catching on quickly in overseas markets where 3M has a strong presence in the hospital channel. Sales also grew nicely in our core Skin and Wound Care business and in Health Information Systems. Health Care sales increased a double-digit rate in every geographic region, with Asia Pacific up 20%, Latin America/Canada up 16%, Europe up 13% and the United States, up 12%. We have been investing more aggressively in emerging markets over the past couple of years to accelerate penetration in our Health Care platforms, and we are beginning to see the benefits in our results. Operating income in Health Care increased 13% to $367 million and margins were 29.5%. We are very excited about our new products in the health care space. For example, our Health Information Systems business recently developed and commercialized a breakthrough software that helps hospitals transition to new standard cooling system called ICD-10. We've already been selected by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid services to support ICD-10 transition planning in its headquarters in Baltimore. Also, in our Food Safety business, we have launched a new test procedure in collaboration with a major food manufacturer to monitor shelf life and food quality. We achieved excellent sales growth in the Oral Care business, especially in developing economies. Recent acquisitions of both orthodontic companies in Brazil and China have expanded our presence in mid and lower tier categories, which will be critical to our long term success in these early stage, but fast growing markets. Let's now turn to Consumer and Office. Sales increased 7% year-on-year to $1.1 billion or 5% in local currencies. Operating income increased 4% to $244 million and margins were strong at 22.3%. Growth was broad-based in the quarter, with nearly all businesses growing in local currency. Notable performance were in our Consumer Health Care, do-it-yourself and Home Care businesses. On a geographic basis, sales grew in all regions, with particular strength in Asia Pacific at 18%, where we continue to invest in China and India to establish brand presence in these growing parts of the world. Latin America and Canada grew sales 11%, and Europe was up 5%, largely due to positive currency impacts. Sales in the United States were up 4%, a nice improvement year-on-year. Seasonal sales and new products helped drive growth in Consumer and Office. Back-to-school met our expectation and provided a nice lift in sales of our Command brand books and mounting solutions. We also expanded our family of market-leading filtrate products, with a new carbon-based home furnace filter that eliminates odor and allergens. On a global basis, we continue to gain penetration in the home care market, leveraging our leading Scotch-Brite brand. Overall, it was a good quarter for our Consumer and Office business. Now, let's go on to Safety and Security & Protection Service business. Sales rose by 18% to $954 million or 14% in local currency. Organic sales were up high single digits, and we added almost 6 points from acquisitions. All geographic regions posted positive growth, led by the United States at 28%, Asia Pacific at 25% and Latin America and Canada at 21%. Operating profit increased 23% to $202 million and operating margins were at 21.1% for the quarter. This quarter's strong growth was driven foremost by Personal Safety products, with good gains in both respiratory and hearing protection, 2 sites of sizable platforms within this business. We also saw a surge in sales from roofing granules, driven by last summer's heavy tornado season. That demand has worked its way through the channel and we anticipate some slowing in the fourth quarter. We drove double-digit growth in security systems accelerate by the December 2010 acquisitions of Cogent Technologies. Cogent gave us important technology in finger, palm, face and iris biometric systems to complement our existing border security and identification solution. Cogent also expands our reach into law enforcement, public safety and commercial access control applications. During the third quarter, we earned a nice win with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, which is using 3M electronic passport readers in all the U.S. air, land and sea ports of entry. Let's now look at our Display and Graphics segment. Sales were $935 million, down 12% year-on-year and down 14% in local currency. As David mentioned, Optical Films for LCD TVs drove much of the decline. Retail TV demand continues to soften, therefore OEMs are lowering brightness specification in order to reduce prices. In addition, they are slowing production in order to lower inventories. On the positive side, we continue to see strong attachment rates on battery-powered devices such as tablet PCs, smartphones and notebooks, where the value proposition for our films is very strong. Excluding Optical, total Display and Graphics sales declined just under 1% in local currencies. Sales in Traffic Safety Systems declined a bit in local currency terms due to lower levels of highway construction funding by governments in the United States and West Europe.  One of our newer businesses in this segment is Architectural Markets, formed a short time ago to accelerate our penetration in the design solution markets. Products here range from 3M Di-Noc finishes to advanced lighting solutions. This business posted double-digit local currency growth in the quarter and continued to show excellent potential. Finally, let's take a look at Electro and Communication business. Sales were $838 million, up 4% and profits were down just slightly to $181 million. Margins for the quarter were 21.6%. All geographic regions posted higher year-on-year growth, led by Europe and the United States at 7% each. Sales rose 9% in our Electrical Market business, a powerhouse franchise that serves the utility and infrastructure markets. Electrical is a true enduring franchise for 3M that just keeps on growing quarter in and quarter out. We also saw good growth in telecommunication markets in the quarter. Sales in the electronics industry rose just slightly, a considerable change versus the high growth rates we saw over the past several quarters. As David mentioned, this market has slowed, which significantly affected our customers' production schedules in Q3. This slowdown is expected to persist for the next few quarters. Electro and Communication announced a number of growth initiative recently, including an agreement with IBM to jointly develop new Adhesives to enable the creation of microprocessors that are up to 100  layers thick. These chips are potentially 1000x faster than those used today. We also announced a manufacturing capacity expansion for 3M ACCR high-capacity overhead conductors, which will gain traction in the marketplace on a global base. In addition, we are building new capacity for 3M branded Novec products used in electronics, data centers, semiconductors and medical markets. Please turn to Slide #5. As both George and David mentioned, it's clear that the macro trends have slowed and growth rates have drifted lower, which naturally begs the question how are we responding? First and foremost, we will stick to our long-term growth plan and continue to invest significantly in research and development. In fact, we have invested $1.2 billion year-to-date, up 14%. New product introduction will continue to fuel growth as we expand our businesses and drive market share gains. Experience tell us that it's especially important in this times to differentiate ourselves from the competition through great products. This is precisely how we improve our competitive position during the last downturn. Secondly, we remain bullish on our long-term growth in developing markets, and plan to continue investing in those countries. Emerging markets now represent 34% of the company, up from 17% in 2000. In addition, we are targeting $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion of CapEx in 2011 versus $1.1 billion in 2010, a healthy increase. We have good line of sight for future growth needs in all of our businesses, so this new capacity will be critical to our future success. We maintain a strong balance sheet, which enable us to return significant cash to shareholders through the ups and downs of economic cycles. Through 9 months of 2011, we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders via cash dividends and gross share buybacks. At the same time, we are establishing a 2012 plan with maximum flexibility. We expect the global economy will grow, but at slower rates, and anticipate there will be growth to capitalize on, but there will be bumps along the way. There just always are, and we all know it. We currently expect that the second half of 2012 will be better than the first as electronics will take a few quarters to wash through the system. Just as we did 2009, we will take full advantage of this time to engage with our customers to develop unique 3M solutions to their challenges. In terms of driving productivity, we have already been quite active during this year in a number of businesses. The Display and Graphics team, for example, has been reducing full-time and temporary position, primarily in Asia, to address declining factory utilization levels and put in place contingency plans early around spending. Electro and Communications responded to weakening demand with targeted action to improve productivity and reduce cost, while staying fully prepared to capitalize on eventual upswing. In Europe, our new regionalized subsidiary structure is driving speed and simplicity in our operation and will save us $10 million this year. Importantly, all of our businesses have aggressively prioritized and are prepared for whatever comes our way in 2012. Going forward, we have implemented hiring freezes in most developed countries. Replacement will be limited to those key positions that were closest to the customers. Our businesses have also triggered contingency plans with respect to indirect costs, which represent over $4 billion annually, so there's still room for more improvement. And finally, we are considering the need for more aggressive actions as we monitor economic growth in 2012. We will have more to say about 2012 at our meeting in New York City during the first week in December. Again, flexibility in our 2012 plan will be key. This quarter's slowdown could prove to be short and temporary, or it could linger into next year. We are prepared for either. So in short, our long term strategy is intact, our financial condition is strong and we are well-positioned to win in any economic scenario. That is a quick overview of the business result and operation. Now, we will turn the call over to David, who will provide some additional color on the quarter.\nDavid W. Meline: Thank you, Inge. Let's start with sales, so turn to Page #6. We posted a record third quarter sales of $7.5 billion, up nearly 10% year-on-year. In dollar terms, the growth was broad-based, with all geographic regions increasing year-on-year. Of note this quarter was Latin America/Canada region with 14% growth year-on-year. This was the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth for the region. Currency was a net positive in Q3, adding 3.1% to sales. FX added 5% to sales in both Asia Pacific and Europe and 3% in Latin America/Canada. However, sales were impacted negatively by the late quarter surge in the dollar, which cost us over 1 point of sales growth. As I mentioned earlier, organic volume growth slowed in the quarter to 1.9%. Volumes increased in all geographic regions with the exception of Europe. More specifically, Western Europe experienced a 4% decline in organic volumes for the quarter. The 2 factors I mentioned earlier, namely the decline in Western Europe, along with slowing electronics, together, hurt 3M's overall organic volume for the quarter by nearly 4 percentage points. Normalized organic volume growth for the company, therefore, was closer to 6%. We continued to raise our selling prices in the quarter, a necessity in light of higher raw material costs. Prices rose nearly 1% year-on-year, adjusting for Optical, where price down is necessary in order to compete, prices for the company rose nearly 2% in the quarter. Through 9 months to date, all of our other businesses are now in a positive price position and are expected to more than cover raw material cost inflation for the calendar year cumulatively. Acquisitions added nearly 4% to sales in the quarter. Please turn to Slide #7 for a look at our income statement for the quarter. Sales, as I mentioned, rose 10% in the quarter, and gross profit dollars grew 6% year-on-year to $3.5 billion. Gross margins were 46.6% versus 47.9% in last year's comparable quarter. We were able to neutralize raw material inflation with selling price increases in the quarter, and we are on track to fully offset raw material inflation for the entire year, with the exception of Optical. As the quarter progressed, our sales did not develop as expected, particularly in September. Demand patterns were very good at times, but choppy during others. As Inge mentioned earlier, we took action to adjust our factory loading levels in some businesses, but the effects were not fully realized in the third quarter. The resulting under-absorbed overhead largely explains this quarter's gross margin decline. Helping to mitigate these factors are ongoing savings in our factories, including faster line speeds, waste reduction, yield improvements, energy savings and other ongoing productivity improvements, driven by our Lean Six Sigma teams around the world. SG&A rose 13% year-on-year, with 10 points of the increase coming from FX and acquisitions, underlying SG&A therefore rose 3%. Similarly, R&D investment rose 10% versus third quarter of last year, maintaining a healthy 5.2% of worldwide sales. 6 points of the R&D increase related to acquisitions and FX. Our business teams are working aggressively to achieve a 32% NPVI target for 2011, which would be an outstanding result considering a lower sales outlook. Operating income was $1.6 billion, up slightly year-on-year, and margins were 21%. Earnings for the quarter were $1.52 per share, down $0.01 versus last year's third quarter. The tax rate was 28.6% in the quarter versus 26.8% last year, which cost us $0.04 per share. A lower share count added $0.02 of benefit in the quarter. Please turn to Slide #8. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1 billion, and we converted 94% of net income to cash, consistent with our historical third quarter average. Networking capital impacts were slightly positive year-on-year, as both inventory and accounts receivable turns were right in line with third quarter 2010 levels. During the quarter, we contributed $248 million to our pension and OPEB plans, $55 million less than in last year's third quarter. At present, we are planning to contribute another $200 million to our plans in the fourth quarter, which would put the full year pension and OPEB investments at $600 million in total. Cash taxes paid were $43 million higher year-on-year. Investment in CapEx for the quarter was $336 million, up $108 million year-on-year. We anticipate full year capital expenditures of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion, up from $1.1 billion in 2010. More than 1/2 of this investment will be in international locations supporting our ongoing strategy to localize production and better serve our customers around the world. Gross share repurchases in the third quarter totaled $849 million, putting us at $2.2 billion through 9 months of the year. For the full year, we now anticipate spending in the range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion, up from our prior range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion gross for the calendar year. Turning to Slide #9. With 3 quarters of the year behind us, let me address our updated outlook for the year. We now expect that earnings per share will fall within the band of $5.85 top $5.95 per share versus a prior expectation of $6.10 to $6.25. Organic volume growth will come in between 3% and 4% for the year versus a prior forecast of 6% to 7.5%, reflecting the more challenging economic environment we face. This is expected to reduce full year earnings by $0.25 to $0.30 per share. Partially offsetting this is the impact of a lower share count we have been more aggressive in purchasing our stock of late, which has the effect of boosting full year earnings by $0.04 to $0.06 per share. On the tax rate, we now estimate that our full year tax rate will be approximately 28.5% versus our previous projection of 29%. This equates to an additional $0.04 of earnings versus our July guidance. Finally, foreign currency impacts will be positive for the year; however, recent U.S. dollar strength has reduced the estimated benefit by $0.06 to $0.10 per share for the full year versus our prior forecast. Approximately 2/3 of this reduction can be attributed to the fourth quarter. Full year operating margins will be approximately 21% for the year. As a reminder, we are absorbing $0.22 per share, pension and OPEB expense headwinds in our 2011 results. Our new guidance suggested for this item implies year-over-year EPS growth of 8% to 10%. Lastly, I would like to share our early thoughts on next year's pension and postretirement expense. We are currently estimating a $0.10 per share headwind in 2012 related to pension and OPEB expense. This forecast assumes that the discount rate on our U.S. plans remains at 4.5%, which is equal to the rate at September month end. It also assumes U.S. asset returns of positive 6%, also equal to our actual performance for the first 9 months of the year. This wraps up our formal comments today. I look forward to seeing many of you at our meeting in December for a complete discussion of our 2012 plans. We hope you can make it. Now we will be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies & Company.\nLaurence Alexander: On demand trends, can you give a little bit more detail on what you're expecting in terms of year-end shutdowns, and if any of the regional end markets where you've see a deceleration, you're already seeing signs of trends troughing?\nDavid W. Meline: Okay. Yes. On the first question concerning year-end shutdowns, what we see in particular is in the areas where we've seen weakening demands. So, for example, in the Optical systems division, we expect in the fourth quarter to have a continued weak demand in that area. And so, our factories supporting that activity will be running much lower than their full capacity, approaching the level that we experienced last year in the fourth quarter. If you look at D&G for the year, we, had last time indicated we thought Display and Graphics sales for the full year would be about flat. We're now expecting that to be in the low to -- in the mid to low single digits on a negative basis. If you look at the Electronics business in ECB, likewise, we're seeing reduced demand and declining requirements from a number of our customer areas, not only in consumer electronics, but also as we have mentioned, spilling over into some of the factory automation area. So we will have lower demand there, which will lower overall sales for that sector to the mid-single digits for the year. In terms of troughing, I would say we haven't really seen yet -- we don't expect to see an upturn yet. But what the indication is right now on October sales is that we're running  pretty consistent with what we had had for the overall third quarter sales space.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Laurence, this is George here. This is, kind of, a little bit on to the backing to what David said. We typically see these things when they happen, if you sort of look at the cause and effect, if you go back to the numbers in IPI in the last couple of quarters, they've dropped by 2 full-percentage points, 200 basis points. What we always see is, that sort of amplified in our supply chain and then it bumps along the bottom, and for a couple of quarters, depending on the efficiency of the supply chain, clearing the excess inventory. And then it begins to creep back up. So we wouldn't expect to be seeing it just yet, but we would probably, if that model that we used in 2009, that seem to work so well there. If that continued, then you'd expect to see that, sort of, begin to sort of ease back up towards the end of the year or maybe into the first quarter next year. That's kind of what you'd expect from the demands that we've seen in the past.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.\nC. Stephen Tusa: I just have a question on the 100 bps of margin improvement for next year. Is that coming from the unusual factory loading, is some of that reversing in the fourth quarter? How visible is that margin improvement?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes, so obviously, we're still right in the middle of doing our '12 planning right now. But the way we're looking at this is, with the running rate where we expect sales to be more moderate next year -- sales growth to be moderate, what we're really looking at is rebalancing our plans so that we're going to run much tighter on the cost side through the year. And so we would expect that to show up -- that improvement to show up in combination between not only cost of goods, but a big piece of that we would expect to see in the SG&A area.\nC. Stephen Tusa: Okay. On the plant front, your CapEx went up pretty dramatically this year. Should we think about kind of CapEx being flat to down next year after this big bump up this year? How do you kind of manage your gross spending in -- from a capital perspective?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes. What I would say is that, exactly. We've seen an increase this year, which is being driven across the business as we localize our production around the world and respond to the fact that coming out of the last recession, we've run up against capacity limitations in a number of the areas. In the context of what we're looking at for next year and beyond, right now, we're not expecting a double-dip recession like the kind of recession we had in the last period. And therefore, we expect actually to see those capital expenditure demands to continue into 2012.  So we don't see that right now backing off significantly at all.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Yes, Steve, we've never -- sorry, go ahead Steve.\nC. Stephen Tusa: Sorry. Go ahead. One last question, just -- I think we're back in the kind of flat to down organic for the fourth quarter. Can you just give us an idea of the segments and kind of the moving -- there's a lot moving around here, obviously, electronics, pretty weak. But the rest of businesses, holding up okay from a growth perspective. Could you may be give us an idea of how quickly some of the non-electronics businesses slow into the fourth quarter?\nDavid W. Meline: Sure. So in terms of by segments, the non-electronics businesses. So if I look at Consumer and Office and Health Care, we expect that the running rate on those, on an organic volume basis, will be similar to what we saw in Q4. So if you look at the full year sales for those businesses, we expect them to finish a full-year basis to be at the low end of the original guidance we'd given last year in December. If you look at ITB and SS&PS, in particular, we're seeing some softening in the third quarter. We expect the running rate in the fourth quarter to be similar to the third quarter rates, which would put those 2 businesses towards the low end of the range that we've set out last year for organic volume growth for those sectors, and the primary driver of that softening is what we saw in Europe in the quarter. So I think that's -- answers your question.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Steve, this is George. Let me just dip in one thing on the CapEx. Obviously, we allow CapEx plans and plant capacity in building over a period of many years. And our guys have not backed off their positive feelings about our growth prospects going forward. And about the many markets that we're managing to make great inroads into. So I think we wouldn't necessarily want to send any signals that we're suddenly giving up on the future just because these source of turbulent issues that you take in place partly in Europe and partly in the consumer electronics business. So we're just -- just want sort of reassure you that there is a pretty bright future out there and we expect to make it happen.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi.\nDeane M. Dray: George, it's been a while since we've asked you to look into the crystal ball. You're really helpful in that -- at the early stages of 2008, but just give us your perspective. We heard from David give kind of 2 scenarios, it could be the shorter slowdown version or it could linger into 2012. And just from the basis of the de-stocking phenomenon, we've seen this before, but I never got the sense that there was a lot of restocking going on, so maybe that will help dampen it. But just kind of take us through your thinking about the scenarios from here.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Yes. Sure. I happen to have the unfortunate position, or joy, I'm not sure what it was, of forecasting that last sequencing and getting it right. And I think it was you that said I couldn't get out of the business until I got it wrong. So I hope I'm not going to get out of the business right now, but anyway, let me tell -- give an answer to your question. The modeling that I did actually back -- and it was a long time ago, almost in 2010, suggested that we would have -- I'm speaking here, Deane, about U.S. numbers. We can use U.S. as kind of a proxy for the world, but the U.S. would begin positive growth. It would peak -- that growth rate would peak somewhere around the middle of 2012. But the average over the half cycle would only be about 1.8% or 2%, and that's what that forecast suggested. So we're not actually expecting any kind of a big double-dip. In fact, I've called it internally a double dimple if you did -- it actually came, a little bit of a play on words I know. So I think we certainly see the reset -- we certainly see the worries I think, in the consumer markets. A lot of stuff driven of course by this European sovereign debt idea. But I think, probably, somewhat slower growth next year, Deane, for the United States. My personal guess is -- in fact the calculation says 1.8%, that I personally did for next year. So, you can take that as positive because it's -- at least the numbers are positive and it's not a sort of cataclysmic downturn. So, I think we'll see this kind of contraction. It will pass through the system. Those markets which are being affected, absent Europe, are pretty fast turnaround markets, Deane. So I think we're going to be okay for next year. I don't think -- absent some pension headwinds, I think, we'll see because of returns and discount rates. But above that, we feel quite confident we'll still have a decent year next year.\nDeane M. Dray: And your comment about the destocking might not being as severe?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Well, of course, we've made the calculations based on the same model we used in 2009. And they actually add up not too far off the numbers that we've seen, Deane, and you've got this aberration of Optical going out there, it's kind of muddying the water. But even if you did the quick calculations dropping from 5 to 3, we usually see that delta of 2, amplified by about 3, which will give you negative 1. At the growth that we're getting from NPVI, would put you back up in the mid-2s -- early 2s, and that's about what we see. So, it seems like the model still works as long as you don't try to put too much precision and accuracy into it, Deane. It seems to be working okay. And if it followed the same pattern in supply chain efficiency that we've seen before, the thing would begin to ease and in December, maybe early in the first quarter of 2012, recognizing of course, December itself is usually a pretty kind of meh month for most of us anyway, since there's not much activity. But generally, more cautious, but generally positive outlooks, Steve -- Deane.\nDeane M. Dray: And then last question for me, just on Slide 5, David referenced the ability to be more aggressive on restructuring, and we'd be interested in hearing, what are the trigger points that you're looking for in terms of when might you start doing that further cost-cutting?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes. So if you look at the comments that I think I made on that, right now, what we're looking at is, first of all, 3M's model, if you think about our business model, we're always in some kind of a change. I wouldn't call it a restructuring, but we're adding, we're trimming, we're moving people, we're redeploying assets. And so, that continues. So as Inge mentioned in the couple of the business, while we haven't talked a lot about headline restructuring, we've adjusted the manning levels, for example, in Mike's D&G business by 1,200 people in the last quarter. And we're adjusting in electronics, where we're also seeing the biggest effect. So we're making those changes as part of a normal course of the business. We continue to do that obviously in a weaker growth environment, overall, we're also making adjustments, but the $5.85 to $5.95 we have in the guidance now does not contemplate any type of additional special restructuring costs beyond the normal course that we're doing. And in terms of the planning for next year, frankly, we're going through that right now. As I said, as we looked at it, we were driving towards a point improvement for the business. That will involve taking a more cautious line in terms of how we're investing to grow, and that growth is  going to be delayed. And eventually, we have to look at all of our businesses and make sure we're competitive. So we'll have to come out with more details here as we firm that up.\nInge G. Thulin: This is Inge. Just a comment, David comment on Display and Graphics and Electro and Communications. As you also see on the result, of course, West Europe -- and we have taken action there relatively early in the process. I think already 18 months ago was when we looked upon that organization and we did 2 things: We split off Central East Europe and Middle East Africa from West Europe. So we separate out our organization, and at the same time, we regionalized in West Europe. And that you saw the savings that we see there, around $10 million for this year. And -- so that have been to adjust the organization based on their situation in West Europe. So, I think that's an important thing for us to make sure that we optimize the structure, reduce the layer, go for more investment in the front-end and type of reduce in the back offices. And that's one of the things to where have gone in Europe and form those regions, where we today, rather than have 4 fully subsidiaries. In Nordic, we have -- now 1 Nordic organization. We have 1 organization in Benelux, rather than 2 subsidiaries. We have 1 region in Alpine versus 2 subsidiaries, so Switzerland and Austria, and we have also Iberia, which is a combination of Portugal and Spain. Although savings is helping us a lot and we're adjusting that as we go.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.\nSteven E. Winoker: Let me just start with the -- couple of follow-ups to the earlier questions. First 1, on that restructuring, how much restructuring is already built in for this year in terms of -- I know you're saying you're not doing it beyond what's normal, but what is the normal amount that's baked in?\nDavid W. Meline: We don't -- to be honest, Steve, we don't quantify in a specific way x amount of dollars in a quarter or a year because it's the normal course of the business that the guys run. So as I say, redeploying resources, re-purposing assets is normal of course. So I frankly wouldn't call out a particular dollar amount attributable to that.\nSteven E. Winoker: Okay. That's fine. Just -- I often do hear that from some of the other companies, so that's why I'm trying to get at that. And on the CapEx side, how much of that is maintenance versus growth CapEx?\nDavid W. Meline: Hold on, I would -- well, let me talk about it trend wise. What we've seen this year, and if we look at the 2012 plans, there's definitely been a shift for us moving, obviously, more to the growth investments. So it's probably up, if I were to guess and Matt can confirm after the call, but it's probably up 10 points from something like 50% to 60% is what we would call growth CapEx in 2011. And we expect that to continue.\nInge G. Thulin: I think that it's in that neighborhood, Steve, but we'll follow up.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Steve, just let me say one other thing, which I hope will be helpful to you. Just -- remembering that we're investing to try to get a lot of the manufacturing capacity we currently have in the wrong places, in the right places. So there will always be an element of our CapEx spend, which is a little above, perhaps, what you might relate just to demand alone, so there's an element there. And so the patents that you see flowing from that are greater spend overseas, greater spend in markets which are growing very fast, energy conservation, and so on, and so forth. Some of which probably not may actually be resident here in the United States. And then last, but not least, one of the things that we decided we're really going to push on this coming year is to try to find a way to allocate an incremental cost, a piece of that capital to focus on driving gross margin, which is a supporting piece of the overall numbers that we're going to target for improvements next year. I would tell you that, while David is absolutely right, we haven't finalized these plans at all. We're still in that process. If you imagine, some elements of it had already been exposed, and we feel pretty confident, not just from a gross margin improvement location for efficiency and through automation, but actually in the overall cost reductions, we feel pretty confident we can get out those numbers or even better numbers. So it's well within our sights, it's well within our capability, and we'll give you some more details on that, Steve, in December, when we speak to you.\nSteven E. Winoker: Okay. And just last question, on the op margin declines in Health Care of 30 basis points and Electro and Communications of 120, I noticed that volume price, together, were up 5.6% in Health Care and 90 basis points in Electro. So just maybe give us a sense for -- on the impact of, given that dynamic, what pricing was and what the investment level was, I know you have increased investments to some extent there. Just a little bit more clarity about why you had these going at opposite directions.\nDavid W. Meline: In terms of margins, see if I can respond, and if not, you can come back at me. Health Care, we did 29.5% in the quarter. As we've said before, we think that's the sweet spot for the business in terms of, on the high 20s. We are getting the kinds of price improvements that we've expected from the businesses. They're modest, because obviously, there's a lot of pressure, in particular in the mature markets, but we've been very encouraged here in Health Care through the year, we've seen increasing momentum for the business in the emerging markets as we've been investing to improve our position. So margins, we look at that, we think that for the foreseeable future is a good level from a planning perspective. In terms of ECB, we have not seen an overall price decline. Of course think about ECB as a combination of about half of the businesses is in the communications and in the electrical infrastructure space, and half is in the consumer electronics. So, a combination of those is, we're able to maintain price on an overall basis. And the key issue for us in terms of managing the price cost equation in consumer electronics, of course, is to continue to be specked into new products, to continue to innovate so that we can offer value to the customer and continue to get acceptable margins on the products. And I would say that's definitely true, despite this temporary correction that's taking place. We're very pleased with the momentum in the business in terms of achieving exactly that objective.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Additional comment on Health Care. I think if you -- as I made some comments in my opening remarks, we have accelerated our investment in emerging market for Health Care, and we now start to see the result in terms of penetration. Also, as we build out our capabilities around patient warming, that is going right into Infection Prevention based on the acquisition we made 1 year ago, that is also working very well for us. But there's some investment on that, which is mostly for additional investment into the international markets, where we happen to see opportunities.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nAlina Khaykin: This is Alina Khaykin sitting in for John. Just a few quick questions. One, on the raw materials. I know you said that you expect that the pricing that you put through so far will recover the raw material cost. But how much pricing do you think you'll have to give up, if any, when raw material costs do decline, say in 2012?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Alina, this is George. Historically, that's not happened. I think, perhaps -- we suffered a little bit in the opposite direction in this particular case. We were probably a little bit late to the party on price this year. We've done some great job, I think, of catching up. But of course when you see a declining market, it is harder to get price, but we haven't found anything in our history that would suggest that we have to give up price. So I think that the chances of that happening, Alina are low, but I think it's a good question.\nAlina Khaykin: Okay. And one other thing. Can you just talk about where the vitality index is now and kind of how it's tracking and what's really driving that?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Yes, sure. Well, it's running around -- I think our target for the end of the end year, we were hoping to get to around 33, but it's running around 32. There was a big -- this is just a sort of, in a sense a part of it is an exercise in arithmetic, there was a big drop off of the big Optical product that was $500 million in sales. So arithmetically, it was just a bit of a harder target this year, but it seems to be running very, very well. I got some data from Chris Holmes in the industrial business yesterday that suggested this thing continues to accelerate and we think ultimately, it's unquestionably the way to make sure our growth rate is sustained. Notwithstanding the fact you do get these transients that most people in our company do see, and they come and they go. And we see both sides of them. We get the penalty when their adjustment is down, and we get the benefit when their adjustment is up. But they're not long-lived. They're typically about 6 months, and we hope that patent will follow here in this particular case too.\nInge G. Thulin: And that's the corporate average. If you take Electro and Communication, it's way above that. And that's also one of the reasons why we continue to make sure we make the right investment in Research and Development as we move ahead for some of those businesses. One, Electro and Communication, where it's very important to have the latest technology as the market will turn at the time here, which we think is in a couple of quarters.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.\nShannon O'Callaghan: On the margins for next year, maybe just a little more color. I mean, Health Care, you're saying, high 20 sweet spots, so that kind of stays where it is. I thought that was kind of the thinking on consumer too as you try to build that more internationally. So are there any segments were you're expecting sort of greater than 100 bps to get the whole thing up more?\nDavid W. Meline: I would say, again, early planning, we haven't finalized, Shannon, so we'll do that in December certainly. But do we expect any big swings? I would say probably the area that we'll be focused on in terms of possible change in margin will be in D&G because we expect frankly, that the TV business, which is part of the Optical systems division, is likely to continue under pressure next year for us, which will put some pressure on the margin in that business. But -- so take that into account. We think that it's still reasonable to expect to move the business backup, in this case, more to a 22% type margin from where we expect to complete the year at 21%.\nGeorge W. Buckley: And you can expect, Shannon, in some places -- as you kind of scan down the array of businesses that we have and the geographies that we have, there are different leverage ratios in different businesses. Some are at 1 or a little under 1, some are at much higher. And the obvious correlation is those that have the lowest leverage are those that we're making most investments in where we expect the highest growth, and those that we have the greatest need to either restructure or find ways to cut cost and get productivity, they will have the highest leverage. And so let's say, it's a bit of a smorgasbord of different numbers right across the company. But net-net, certainly not preliminary work, it looks well within the chance of doing.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Okay. And then you mentioned sort of weakness spilling over into Factory Automation, which was kind of interesting. I mean, is that isolated to kind of the electronics end markets that you're seeing or maybe a little more color on that comment.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Well, I made the comment because what I wanted to do is not just dump consumer electronics, but to recognize that some of the businesses that we serve, serve not just consumer electronics, but electronics more generally in medical and even in Automotive in some cases. So I wanted to just hint to people that it's not -- this is not just in these locations alone, and you can well imagine that if weakness was to persist for a long time in consumer electronics, but then you have to expect that it would then ultimately begin to creep out in other places. We do see it in our results, Shannon, we do have, for example, in the Industrial and Transportation business, our industrial Adhesives and Tapes business which is in that segment serves the electronics market -- all electronics markets, and they certainly saw some softening as well, which was consistent and contemporaneous with that in the more traditional electronics businesses that we report separately. So the -- I suppose the thing that we all wonder about is, is this going to be contained only in this area. The beauty of electronics is the blasted thing comes back so fast. I remember, Shannon the forecast on TSMC utilization being at 35% in 2009, and some people tried to convince me that they would remain under 60% for 5 years. And I said, it's just not going to happen, guys. And so these things, just they do, they do recover very, very quickly. I mean, you could argue that there needs to be a catalyzing event in the end market, but I think it's too soon to -- I could be forecasting any broader malaise, and with a little bit more data, we'll know, but I think for now it's a bit too early for that kind of forecast.\nShannon O'Callaghan: But just to clarify, are you seeing that spill over into Health Care, on auto and other areas yet or you're just saying if it continues, we would expect to?\nGeorge W. Buckley: I'm suggesting if it continues, we'd expect to. It's not in Health Care right now. In fact actually the Health Care results, as you've seen, they had a tougher period of time last year and had begun to sort of recover this year, in fact, they're doing quite well. And Automotive has really followed the same pattern. You do have a little bit of sort of another fly in the ointment as you might say, which is this issue of Thailand. You've got these floods in Thailand, and Thailand is a great source of Automotive components for the world, in particular for Japan. And they have a very -- they are a strong 2-wheel market. So, as I sometimes say, just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water, not to use a pun in Thailand, we may yet see some other cascading impacts from our supply chain in Thailand that give Japan a little bit of a ding as well. So that's additive to this mix, and it's too soon to tell whether that will be or will not be a problem.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research.\nJeffrey T. Sprague: Having mentioned Japan, I wonder, George, Can you -- are we totally kind of normalized there? And I'm wondering, have you seen or are you seeing any insurance recoveries in Japan yet?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Japan is actually probably doing a little bit -- notwithstanding what I said about Thailand, Japan is probably doing a little bit better than what we thought, and it's probably a little bit in advance of where we thought in its recovery. So I think that part of it is okay. Remind me the second piece of the question, Jeff, I forgot sorry.\nDavid W. Meline: Insurance recoveries.\nJeffrey T. Sprague: Any insurance recoveries yet?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Oh, insurance. Yes. We've not actually got any money in over the transient, but we met with our insurance people yesterday and there were some -- without me being specific about the numbers, because David will strangle me if I am, there was a reason for optimism that's somewhere around half of our number -- of our impact might get covered.\nJeffrey T. Sprague: Is that included in your guidance?\nGeorge W. Buckley: No, it is not.\nJeffrey T. Sprague: Okay. And I'm just wondering, bigger picture on Display and Graphics now. I guess, the good news on all those pressure on TV is that, what's the percentage of the Optical segment has to be declining definition? How far are we away from some type of crossover here where handhelds and other products maybe, overtake TV in surface area or dollar value or however you want to look at it?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Very close is the answer to that question, Jeff. Now we're down at about 20% detachment rates in TVs. That thing historically in the old days, in the glory days of Optical, was up in 70s, it sort of went through a transition over a period of couple of years. Bumped down even as low as -- we were expecting to go as low as 12 or 13. I don't think it have actually quite made that number. But it's certainly going into the teens, and now we're bumping along in the 20s. I think in all candor, it's really -- it's like a tale of 2 cities, it really is. The mobile device, hand-held type device market, even the monitor devices, some lovely new innovations due to hit the market in monitors that you'll see that we benefit from. But in the -- that seems to be completely robust. It's a wonderful, wonderful business. It grows rapidly, highly profitable. TVs on the other hand is the flipside of that coin. It's a market which is characterized by way too much capacity, it has scrambles per share, full channels, incentives to retailers, incentives to consumers to flush it out. And of course then, that all backs up in very, very heavy pricing pressure on people -- so that TV piece of the business is not all that profitable, but net-net, Optical is still very profitable. So I think we're getting to the point, Jeff, as you asked really, where it's just ultimately, I think in 2 to 3 years, becomes a vanishingly small part of the problem and ultimately, if not disappear, it will certainly fade into the background of our company.\nJeffrey T. Sprague: Great. And just finally, Inge, good to have you on the call. I'm wondering if you could give us a little more granularity on Europe, I think until this quarter, most companies would say weakness is in the periphery, but maybe not so much Germany and other places. But we have been hearing now more kind of weakness in the core. Can you just elaborate on what you're seeing in Europe and how you think the fourth quarter plays out?\nInge G. Thulin: Yes, I think -- as we all know, as many things going on in Europe. Everything is starting maybe with consumer confidence that is down, right? But if you look upon it geographically, there's a -- it's a couple of places that still are doing well. And Germany is doing relatively well, so is Nordic and also the Alpine regions. So that means that Germany, Switzerland and Austria, together with Nordic, are still doing well for us. And I'm saying, well, we have local currency growth there in the quarter from 8 to 12 percentage. So doing well, slowing a little bit. And why it's slowing, it's very much also due to the fact that there is a -- government spending is down, which means that for traffic safety and security, that will slow down our business and also a little bit into Health Care of course, right, even if that's a private sector. So that's slowing a little bit. And then we saw, generally speaking, I would say, over Europe in this quarter, specifically, as you saw our growth was down that the manufacturing sector is cutting back production and over time in the plants. And Automotive was a key driver for that. So when we looked at upon it, we would say that, Industrial and Transportation business is a big portion for us, our company in total as the manufacturing sector slowed down a little bit lead by Automotive specifically, we felt that of course. And then you take the government spending holding on, which done -- it impacted Display and Graphics, specifically in Traffic Safety Systems. I think that's what we saw. You know, as we know that still, Italy, Spain and in some cases, U.K., has a little bit of challenge of growth. We also saw, due to the Industrial and Transportation, we also saw a little bit down in respirators, which is going into the overall manufacturing sector. On the other hand, if you take Central East Europe and Middle East Africa, it's doing well for us. So the growth is still coming there. We are doing well, and in fact, Middle East Africa, as you know, we've been -- not we, but the world have had a war that's going on there. And our organization, they have done remarkably well. Now one thing that I would say relative to Europe is, everything is coming down to leadership. And I can tell you that our leadership in West Europe is remarkable and very strong. We have local managing directors in those countries except for 2, which is in U.K. and in Iberia. And those people have been through this before, and they are very, very experienced. And they can take, under this localization strategy that George laid out and we have executed here the last 5 years, this is now a string for us. We have very strong people on the ground that no other countries, and can act immediately. They don't need to wait 24, 48 hours in order to figure out what is going on and get some direction from us back here. Being on the country, they can take action immediately, they speak the language and have all the authority and we have empowered them to take action very fast as things are becoming tougher. So I will say that, the one thing I think that we as management here feel very good about is the strength of our leadership as managing directors back in West Europe and in time like this when we see news, the whole time and everyday in the papers, so what is going on or what is not going on, you sleep a little bit better when you know that you have a very seasonable management back there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Terry Darling from Goldman Sachs.\nTerry Darling: David, I'm wondering if I could just clarify the commentary on the fourth quarter organic picture. I think I heard essentially D&G expected flattish year-over-year, Electro and Communication down significantly and the other businesses kind of close to 0. If we focus on an average that gets us to 0, which gets you to the high end of the 3% to 4% range, is that basically the picture?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes. Just to walk through it again, we expect in D&G and ECB for Q4, on a year-over-year basis, to be down negative growth, which will be somewhere between 0 and mid-single digits. And then the rest of the business as we expect, will continue to run close to the levels -- around the levels that we saw in Q3. Does that help?\nTerry Darling: In terms of the year-over-year growth rates?\nDavid W. Meline: In terms of -- yes. Yes.\nTerry Darling: In other words, Industrial and Transportation around 8%, Health Care around 5%, 6% [indiscernible that gets you to 0?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes, that type of the trend. So what I expect when we close the year, if I look at my total organic volume for ITB and SS&PS, it'll be at the low end of the original guidance range. So we had said 7% to 9% for ITB for the year. I expect to be towards the low end of that range. SS&PS, we had said 4% to 6% for the year. Again, I expect to be at the low end. In both cases, the key driver of that, which is a softening from what we expected when we were on the call in July is primarily around Europe and a little bit in ITB. They sell into the electronics business.\nGeorge W. Buckley: Terry, those are the annual numbers. We can work through the, what it means here off-line.\nTerry Darling: I guess just where I'm heading with it is, to try to understand in the context of the new guidance, are you assuming that you have further deceleration in 4Q or that the rate of decel in September just kind of continues into 4Q?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes, we're looking at 4Q right now as being in the range that we experienced in the third quarter. So relatively flat.\nTerry Darling: Okay. And to try to come at the impact from inventory, I don't know if it's possible to do this, but if you look at, just the delta in the organic revenue growth guidance for the full year, call it 3.5% versus 7%, about $800 million on a year-over-year basis, I'm just wondering is there any way to swag at what the impact from the inventory clearance in electronics and other areas might be in that context?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Yes, this -- it would be a slag. This is George, Terry. Recognizing it's really a good idea to make too many swies, but I would say that's -- it's a good -- that inventory question -- it's probably 1.5 of growth on the year will be my guess.\nTerry Darling: Okay. that's helpful. And then, just in terms of the confidence in improving margins next year, how are you thinking about R&D? I mean, you got sort of this 2-speed world where developed markets -- it's where the pressures are coming from ex-electronics, which is global. You're starting -- you're trying to still grow the emerging markets. How does R&D shakeout in your thinking preliminarily here at this point for '12?\nGeorge W. Buckley: I don't think there's any material change in our outlook on R&D, Terry. I mean, it comes from a couple of points. Number one, these are not like factory resources that you can kind of turn on and turn off. These are PhD scientist that in the end -- they're not something you can park away and bring them back in a quarter or a half years time. So you have that challenge. Above and beyond that, we've always taken the view, Terry, it certainly works so very, very well for us in 2009 that we can't eat sea prawn  -- in this kind of time, it's ever more important to build and differentiate our products through new product development in R&D. And it's worked so well for us. So in the future, Terry, I don't see any material changes in that as an approach. We may have the margins, we often have -- David and I and now Inge have a little bit of a kitty that we keep to one side that we will invest in new business development. That can be $100 million, even $200 million in some years. We probably will be -- a little bit more circumspect with those sorts of things. But I think in the net core R&D, we don't expect to change our philosophy essentially at all.\nPatrick D. Campbell: Thanks, everybody. It's a busy day, with a lot of companies reporting. We have a few still in the queue, and I apologize. We are going to end the call, but we'll follow up directly with those that are in the Q&A queue. George?\nGeorge W. Buckley: Well, thank you very much, everybody. It's great to talk to you all again. And we look forward to talking to you sometime in December. Thanks a lot, guys. Goodbye.\nDavid W. Meline: Goodbye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the 3M Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, July 26, 2011. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nMatt Ginter: Hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2011 business review. Today, we'll review our most recent results, along with an updated outlook for the rest of this year. The PowerPoint presentation accompanies today's conference call, which you can access on 3M's Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Today's slide presentation and the audio replay will be archived on our website for an extended period of time. With me today are George Buckley, 3M Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Meline, our Chief Financial Officer. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide #2. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K list some of our most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. So with that, let's get started, and I'll turn the program over to George. Please turn to Slide #3.\nGeorge Buckley: Thank you very much, Matt, and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us today. We really appreciate it. For the numbers, this was another very good quarter for 3M. Sales rose 14% to $7.7 billion, an all-time high for any quarter in our history. We were on track for $30 billion plus in sales for the year. Operating income was $1.7 billion and margins were nearly 22%, with 5 businesses above 20% for the quarter and the sixth one knocking on the door. We posted earnings per share of $1.60, an all-time record in the second quarter for us, and we returned $1.1 billion in cash to shareholders via a combination of share buybacks and dividends. Free cash flow was $1.2 billion, and we converted 100% of net income to cash in the quarter. What is most impressive is that we achieved these results in a quarter that had more than its fair share of challenges. If you'll recall that in our April earnings report, we described some of the headwinds that we expected would affect the second quarter, and in fact, they played out largely as we expected. We knew the second quarter was going to be the nut hole of the year. And if we could do reasonably well going through it, we'd likely do okay in the balance of the year. For example, in Japan, we expected and outlined that the knock on effects of March's earthquake would be at their worst in the second quarter. They're getting as the year went on. We estimate that this temporarily reduced our sales growth in the quarter by just under 2.5%, margins by 50 basis points and earnings by $0.07 per share. We expect that these impacts will weigh in the second half of the year, and in fact, there is reason for hope beyond that as the reconstruction phase begins. We're also more optimistic on the recovery of insurance claims. Also in the quarter, as we anticipated, we experienced fewer orders for optical films, LCD TVs. The LCD TV  business is a cyclic business with the periodicity of about 2 years late over the general economic cycle and it's simply going through one of those down cycles that reflect the inventory corrections, and ultimately a less robust consumer end market. Recall please that last quarter, we describe the LCD deep channel as full, and with about 3 weeks excess inventory on hand. And we know that this always comes  pricing attachment rate pressure. This is a business where the retailers make 4% margin with 15% to 20% down price annually or 4%, if you like, in 1 quarter. Retailers and set manufacturers must correct quickly in these situations to stay in business, and in fact, they did respond with sharp production cuts in the second quarter. When they do, it gives us fits and starts. On the whole, our optical films sales declined by 22% in the second quarter, causing a 1.3% drag on organic growth. LCD TV, however, remains a fundamentally good industry, driven by innovation, and OEM seeked to partner with 3M to make that innovation happen. And overall, optical is a fine business with $1.6 billion in annual sales with operating margins in the 20s. However, we do sense some weariness among some of the OEMs, as TV prices begin to approach bottom and the asymptote of total cost in price is reached. I believe in the future, the market will bifurcate or trifurcate into performance, mass and entry markets. There are very definite signs that one or more manufacturers will begin focusing only on the high-performance segment, and ultimately, we're being more value-add, more features, better pricing and some overall stability to the market. This is a market primed for a new entrant with a unique value proposition. But for now, LCD TV is less than 40% of our optical film mix and other applications such as smartphones and tablet PCs continue to grow very nicely. I will start this next part of my talk by reminding listeners that I'm not an economist. But on the economic front, there is no doubt that Q2 data suggests global economic growth moderated. And we felt that within our results. You have to be careful not to let the Japan and Optical issues cloud the 3M data. Beyond those more obvious impacts, it appears that consumer related end markets, particularly consumer electronics, are feeling the effects of stress.  With our product to market mix, we tend to see those impacts come and go quite rapidly. As a team, we have a collective view that things were just a little bit harder in Q2, no collapses, no catastrophes, just that bit tighter. We've all seen this economic phenomena before and very clearly so in the last 2 economic cycles. Both recoveries were initially very fast and experienced big jumps in profits, then, too, in oil and commodity prices. Last time, it was also complete by higher interest rates. These various forces plus things like increased consumer savings rates, all impact the consumer's ability to spend money on other things. As these transient ebbs and flows occur, the economy often takes a breather or pause, if you like, as it gradually adjusts to the new realities around costs, interest rates, credit and prices. Economic recoveries are never linear, and along this recovery path line are intermittent periods of slow growth, still growth, mind you, but only slower. This is how we view today's situation. We believe that global economy's in a slow spot for a while, but will reaccelerate again as commodity prices ease, fuel cost reduce and spending is redirected elsewhere in the economy. So nothing has fundamentally changed, and we are well positioned to capitalize on that growth and certainly more so than others. Even with these challenges, we posted double-digit growth in the second quarter in 4 of our 6 businesses, with particular strength in Industrial and Transportation at 25% and Safety and Security and Protection Services at 20%. Organic volumes rose 3.2% for the quarter, impacted, of course, by Japan and H1N1. And without these transient headwinds, volume growth was closer to the 6%. TVs added another 1.3% drag to this total.   I do not tell you this on an excuse or exclude basis, I do it solely  to help listeners understand the underlying strength in our model remains good. As the coming quarters roll out, Japan's effects will subside and pass. H1N1 is already closer rolling off, and LCD TV will do its normal cyclic thing coming back as innovation producers of new products and consumer spending increases. Currency was, again, a help to us. But even with that benefit, we had 5 or 6 businesses increase their sales in local currencies. Selling prices increased 0.8%, a noticeable improvement versus the first quarter, reflecting a lot of good progress by our business leaders to offset raw material increases. And finally, acquisitions added 4 points of growth year-on-year. So these are the highlights for the quarter. All in all, I'm well pleased with our performance, and please now turn to Slide #4. On last quarter's call, which was shortly after the earthquake and subsequent tsunami in Japan. We provided our early review of the potential impact on our business. I thought it would be helpful to provide our latest update today. On the whole, things are progressing about as we expected. From a sales standpoint, demand has been stronger than anticipated in the automotive OEM and also in energy-saving window films used in the construction and repair of residential and consumer -- commercial buildings. Offsetting this to some extent has been consumer electronics, where our OEM customers slow production in the second quarter to work off excess inventories. Weak end market for demand, for LCD TV demand was also a factor. In terms of cleanup and reconstruction, the Japanese government approved 2 budgets totaling $60 billion. From that amount, funds have been released to support temporary housing construction efforts and to partially support the cleanup. There remains a massive amount of debris that needs to be cleaned up before any rebuilding can be done. So it's unclear exactly when that rebuild will begin. But efforts  are methodically in motion, which is not surprising given the magnitude and complexity of the required effort in Japan. As things improve, we have  of course working to capture additional sales for our businesses. But here, I highlight 3 focus areas in particular. The first relates to cleanup and repair, where we expect to see some nice demand for our Personal Safety products, as well as do-it-yourself consumer goals used to repair homes, buildings and factories. The second area relates to energy savings, namely in the area of energy reusing protective window films. And finally, as the rebuild goes into motion, we expect to see some demand pickup in our infrastructure-related businesses such as traffic signage, telecoms and utility solutions and commercial construction. In the second quarter, we estimate that the earthquake and its aftermath ended up costing us about $160 million in sales, which, as I mentioned, hurt our total company growth rate by 2.4 percentage points. The corresponding loss in pretax[ph]  profits was $80 million or about $0.07 per share. These estimates are largely in line with our expectations. It appears that the second quarter will be the worst of it, and we expect a modest $0.01 to $0.02 negative impact in the second half of the year. At this point, these estimates do not include any possible insurance recoveries. This should tell us that we will be successful in recovering a meaningful proportion of these losses, but we have taken a conservative stance at this point, and we'll share more details as the situation in Japan unfolds. Let me quickly take you through the performance of our businesses. If you please now turn to Slide #5. In Industrial and Transportation, which represents over 1/3 of our company, we posted another excellent quarter. Sales increased a whopping 25% to $2.6 billion with all major geographic regions posting double-digit growth. In addition, all units within the business contributed to that growth, reflecting our strategy of broad-based investment and to getting more of our businesses growing. The weak dollar also added to sales, contributing about 7 points of growth in the quarter in TV [ph]. There were some real stars in Industrial and Transportation this quarter. Renewable energy, for example, grew its sales by 61%, so the recent investments we've made in Singapore and elsewhere are really paying off. Abrasives grew its sales by more than 50%, a combination of double-digit organic growth, along with the newly acquired sales from Winterthur, which we bought in March of this year. On a sidenote, for interest, our Cubitron II platform recently won the TechAmerica Foundation's American Technology Award in the manufacturing category, a real achievement by our people. As I stressed many times before, this is proof positive that innovation can be applied everywhere, and it works to differentiate the company no matter how superficially slow, uninteresting or boring a market might seem to be to some people at first blush. Our Aerospace and Aircraft Maintenance business also grew sales by 35%, and in 3M's largest divisions, Industrial, Adhesives and Tapes, sales growth was 25%. The list could go on. Profits in Industrial and Transportation increased 17% and margins were 20.6% for the quarter. Moving to Health Care now, sales rose 14% to $1.3 billion and, if you don't pardon the pun, margins remain very healthy at nearly 29%. Acquisitions contributed 5 points to growth in Health Care, which was largely attributable to our October 2010 acquisition of Arizant, a leader in patient and food warming systems for hospitals. This business continues to exceed top and bottom line objectives and quickly became earnings accretive. So thus far, we like what we see. Lastly, our market leading Littmann brand, electronic stethoscope was used on the space shuttle to transmit astronaut's heart sounds to earth. It's a very nice exposure for this important new product platform in Health Care. In Consumer and Office, sales increased 9% for the year, about half organic and half due to currency. We're doing all regions of the world with particular strength in Latin America at 23% growth, and Asia Pacific at 21% growth. Europe also drove 20% plus growth, also caused by currency, but still the business drove mid-single-digit organic growth in that region. U.S. growth was 1% year-on-year, comparable to the results from most major retailers and influenced by low consumer confidence levels and persistently high unemployment. I have pointed out in the past, and it's still true today that consumer companies in general are struggling to grow. So comparatively, our results are quite good. Our consumers in many places are strapped.  Encompass in general is low. Our team continues to find new opportunities to expand the business. Profits in Consumer and Office declined 4% in the quarter, reflect the continuing ongoing investments in new products, brand development, marketing sales coverage in developing economies. These investments are delivering hugely accelerated growth in China, for example, where sales increased 51% in the second quarter, and in India, which grew its Consumer and Office sales by 29%. This, I think, bodes very well for the future. But even with these investments, Consumer and Office generated close to 20% operating margins in the second quarter. I should also mention that just this past week, we announced the acquisition of the do-it-yourself and professional business of GPI Group. This deal will give us an excellent array of complimentary products from brands in the area of DIY tapes, hooks, insulation and floor protection products, and importantly, will be become a critical beachhead for our DIY business in Western Europe. I know sales here are just under EUR 100 million. And we expect the deal to close sometime in the fourth quarter. Turning now to Safety, Security and Protection Services, sales rose an impressive 20% in the quarter, including about 7 points from currency. All geographic regions generated double-digit sales growth, with particular strength in Latin America at 32% and Asia Pacific at 24%. Worldwide organic growth in this business was north of 5%, despite a near 3-point drag for H1N1 related comparisons. On the other hand, we saw some additional sales of personal and protective equipment related to the cleanup efforts in Japan. Less than the loss of H1N1, it helped the growth rate regardless. Operating profit increased 23% and margins were a strong 24% for the quarter. Moving now to Display and Graphics, second quarter results were $973 million in sales, a decline of 7%  year-on-year. Operating income was $222 million, and margins were just shy of 23% for the quarter. As I mentioned, optical was the biggest driver of the sales decline, with LCD TV related declines, partially offset by continued strength in smartphones and tablet PCs. On the new product front, optical recently introduced a family of new film solutions for tablet applications. They increase both brightness, enhance outdoor viewing and reduce the overall thickness of the backlight films. So while the LCD TV space may be tough at the moment, the pace of innovation never really slows. Elsewhere in Display and Graphics, sales increased year-on-year in commercial graphics and architectural markets. Traffic Safety Systems also had positive second quarter sales growth, albeit all currency related. So underlying growth was down slightly in that business. Highway construction spending remains soft in both U.S. and Western Europe, but we'll begin to flow eventually, but we're not counting on it from a planning perspective. Finally, Electro and Communications had another very good quarter. Sales rose 14% to $864 million. Operating income was also increased 14% to $200 million, and margins were still at 23.1%. We, again, posted double-digit local currency growth in our electronics markets materials business, driven by solutions for semiconductor and consumer electronics, most notably tablet PCs. We continue to see this as an attractive area to invest, and in fact, during the quarter, we opened a new temporary wafer bonding application lab in Taiwan for 3D integrated circuits and ultrathin wafer handling. We also posted strong double-digit sales growth in the electrical markets business, which serves the power utility and infrastructure markets. Our team here was energized by yet another win in the area of high-voltage overhead power contractors, or ACCR as we call it. A major Brazilian unit utility just installed 3M's ACCR in Sao Paulo coastal area, which represents the 7th application to date in South America. ACCR will turn about $40 million in profitable sales this year, and we are excited about its potential in the future. This is a quick summary of our business segments. Now I plan to turn the call over to David. David?\nDavid Meline: Thanks, George. If you could now turn to Page #6. Second quarter sales increased 14% year-on-year to nearly $7.7 billion. During the quarter, we saw particular strength in our general industrial and personal safety businesses. As George mentioned, organic volumes contributed 3.2% to growth, and over 7% adjusting for Japan earthquake impacts, H1N1 and optical. Selling prices continued to accelerate your, increasing 80 basis points for the quarter and a nice improvement versus the flat price performance we saw in the first quarter. If I adjusted for electronics-related businesses where price down is a necessary part of the business, prices for the company rose 1.3%. With few exceptions, our businesses have enacted at least one round of price increases, and several have implemented a second or third round, depending on the severity of raw material increases in their businesses. Price increases should get progressively better in the third and fourth quarter, the exception being optical, where we are expecting a somewhat tougher pricing environment in the third quarter. Acquisitions added 4% to sales in the quarter, and currency was a positive 6.1%. Second quarter gross profit increased 10% to $3.6 billion, and gross margins declined by 1.6 percentage points. Foreign currency impacts hurt gross margins in the quarter due to the weak U.S. dollar, as did higher pension and OPEB expense, along with higher raw material prices. SG&A rose 17% year-on-year due to 4 primary factors. 7 points of the increase related to foreign exchange effects as the weak U.S. dollar resulted in higher translated costs from foreign subsidiaries. Another 6 points was due to SG&A increases from businesses we acquired within the last 12 months. Higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense contributed 3 points to the overall increase. And finally, this quarter, we continued to invest to support future growth in areas such as sales reps, advertising and promotion. R&D investment rose 15% versus the second quarter of last year and was 5.2% of worldwide sales. Our labs are introducing new products at a very high rate, and we expect that new products as a percent of sales will rise again in 2011. Operating income rose 4% to $1.7 billion, and margins declined just over 2 percentage points. Underlying operating income growth was 14% adjusted for Japan H1N1 and pension and OPEB expense headwinds. Second quarter tax rate was 27.1%, up 0.5 point versus last year's second quarter. Through 6 months of 2011, our tax rate was about 28%. For the full year, we now expect the tax rate to be approximately 29% versus a prior expectation of 29.5%. Net income also rose 4% to $1.2 billion. Again, if you adjust for Japan, H1N1 and pension and OPEB expense, net income would have grown by 12% year-on-year. With that, let us focus a bit more on the change in the operating margin. Please turn to Slide #7. We reported a 21.6% operating margin for the quarter, an outstanding level on an absolute basis in and of itself, but it did decline by just over 2 points from the unusually high margins we saw in last year's second quarter. I would like to walk you through the reasons for that change. First, organic volume growth in the quarter was 3.2%, which contributed 30 basis points to the operating margin. Selling price increases only partially offset raw material inflation, resulting in a net margin penalty of 50 basis points in the quarter. So on the whole, organic volume growth leverage and net raw material price inflation were offsetting. For 2011 in total, we are driving towards a 0 dollar impact from raw material inflation, net of selling price increases. I'm confident for the majority of our businesses  we will get there. Earthquake-related disruption in Japan hurt second quarter operating margins by 50 basis points, which was very much what we had expected. Again, it appears that the second quarter will be the worst of it. Higher pension and OPEB expense penalized margins by 80 basis points year-on-year, and currency impacts reduced operating margin by 60 basis points in the quarter. To sum up the margin discussion, the major factors affecting this year's results should get better in 2012. Japan is troughing as we speak, and we have every reason to believe that Japan growth in 2012 could be quite good. Pension and OPEB expense could become a tailwind, assuming current interest rates and projected asset returns. Currency is obviously, difficult to predict, but assuming the dollar only stays at current levels, the margin impact we've seen this quarter would wane over time. So while it is early yet  to make a definitive call on 201,2, this set of comps appear to be in our favor. Please turn to Slide #8, where I will review second quarter cash flow highlights. We generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow in the second quarter, and converted 100% of net income. Operating cash flow rose $313 million year-on-year, with cash taxes accounting for the majority of the variance. U.S. tax payments in Q2 of 2010 were unusually high due to audit and estimated tax payments. These payments returned to a more normal level in Q2 of 2011. Investment in capital expenditures totaled $295 million, an increase of $115 million  year-on-year. A substantial portion of this investment is addressing supply constraints in a number of businesses that are growing rapidly, including renewable energy, traffic signage in developing economies, optically clear adhesives and glass bubbles. Importantly, our CapEx is increasingly shifting towards international markets and fast growing developing economies in particular, as we continue to migrate our manufacturing to better balance our sales with our manufacturing capability. We estimate that full year CapEx will be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Through the first half of the year, we have spent $1.4 billion on gross share repurchases. Half of which was completed here in the second quarter. That is a quick summary of our second quarter results. And now, I hand it back to George. Please turn to Slide #9.\nGeorge Buckley: Thank you very much, David. Now for a few words about our full year outlook. Given the Japan tsunami tragedy, TV market dynamics and some signs of a slower economic growth, we always knew that second quarter would be the most challenging in the year. The test now is to figure out what's most likely to happen in the rest of 2011. We know that as faster growth resumes, we will see the rapid benefit of that. In Japan, automotive plants are coming back on stream. And since the largest part of our automotive sales are what we would call, spec in components. And if you've seen market share among OEMs could impact our sales if we are expecting  on the substitute car sales. So I see some upside in automotive in Japan in the second half and ultimately, in their reconstruction activities. We begin to see sales increase in protective equipment and window films and similarly slow in Japan-based consumer electronics. It appears that our industrial, safety and security businesses will remain robust in the near term. As a counterbalance to that, given the loss on some tack [ph] in the LCD TV market, I see no upside in optical this year, unless fuel prices continue to fall and consumer spending in general begins to improve. As new TV models are developed for lease,  however, we usually regain attachment rates. Outside the TV business, our cost sales in China, Taiwan and Korea remain strong and showed no signs of abating. They're all well into the 20s range and even 30s in one case. As to whether the  Chinese government can execute a soft landing in dialing back growth, I'm quite confident that they will pull it off. The Chinese government is stuffed full of some of the most brilliant and best educated minds in the world, and based on history, I, for one, will not bet against them. Let's also remember that this soft landing is pulling back growth from about 11% to about 9%, not from 3% to 1%. And the counterbalancing effects of easing inflation more than offset the slightly lower growth. More of a demand may be leaking outside China, adding to let [ph]  [demands elsewhere and muting the overall impact. Some pretty good news is that we have been gathering strength in the United States, with growth rates beginning to accelerate. In fact, we grew 8.7% in the second quarter. It appears that we are beginning to gain share. The Census Bureau data shows U.S. inventory was a little bit higher, possibly suggesting some transient corrections happened in June. But durable goods orders were up 1.9%, arithmetically consistent with recorded expansions in U.S. GDP. Overall, the leading economic indicators are positive for the U.S. and for most of Europe, except for France. So I remain mildly optimistic, not for huge growth spurt, but for gradually improving market conditions later in the third quarter. We have good momentum of price recovery, which I think will continue to accelerate, and this bodes well for margins in the second half. Netting all of these factors together, we continue to expect organic sales growth will be in the range 6% to 7.5%, including an expected 1% drag from Japan. No material change versus our prior expectations. So for 2011 in total, putting this together with the acquisitions, price and a more positive currency outlook, we're expecting strong double-digit growth with revenues easily eclipsing the $30 billion mark for the year. We now expect that per share earnings will be between $6.10 to $6.25 range versus a previous expectation of $6.05 to $6.25. So we're taking up the low end by $0.05. All in all, after a good second quarter, yet slightly tougher economic picture, we believe this is the right way to think about 2011. Thank you all very much for your attention, and we'll now be happy to take your questions. Thanks a lot, everyone.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners.\nJeffrey Sprague: George, putting into account your [indiscernible] there, still little unclear [indiscernible] that you untouched in the back half to your prior [indiscernible] given that LCD is coming in weaker, that LCD just awash of that[indiscernible] actually something stronger the back [indiscernible] you're thinking at the end of the [indiscernible]\nMatt Ginter: Jeff, it's Matt. Could you please just try to repeat your question? You were breaking up on our end.\nGeorge Buckley: You've got a voice activated phone but it sounded [indiscernible]. We heard about half of what you said.\nJeffrey Sprague: I was just wondering if there's something in particular you see better in the back half of the year relative to your prior expectation, the fact that you kept your organic growth range the same with LCD looking tougher or is just the LCD just really kind of caught up in the 150 basis point range there.\nGeorge Buckley: I think Jeff, I mean, we always knew even, obviously, going to the second quarter, we knew that this was going to be, I call it the nut hole, that we were going to get dragged through this year. So I think the second quarter was just fine, and we see a lot of strength in the industrial businesses, in SS&PS. Pricing favoring us going forward, so it seems to be good momentum on price recovery. Japan, here and there, generally more optimistic, particularly in automotive. But then you've got this always,  you said, Jeff, of optical, which is probably pulling in maybe a $0.05 drag on the numbers. So all in all, it's really a pretty good story going forward, with the exception of that 1 point. And we see probably, maybe beginning in the late third quarter, probably a little bit of reactionary. I'm not talking about any great transition to some sort of great new growth future, but I think the economy, as it's gone through this kind of pause, will go through another point of inflection sometime around the end of the third quarter and begin to accelerate again. So we remain pretty optimistic, and the numbers in modeling that we've done suggest that this is a reasonably robust set of numbers on our forecast.\nJeffrey Sprague: Great, and then as a follow-up, maybe kind of a 2-part follow-up, but thinking about the margin walk, both as it relates to price and FX. Obviously, FX moves around. I think that historically, your margins on FX conversion have actually been decent, sometimes even higher than the segment average. But you had a 60 basis point headwind from FX this quarter. Is there something different going on in the mix there? And along the same lines, thinking about that margin [ph],  is the price that you have in effect now the way you exited the quarter? What you need to kind of reach the parity you're talking about or is there more that you need in the back half the year?\nDavid Meline: Yes, this is David Meline. On the first point, as it relates to the FX impact on the margins, what you do see is you see some variation from quarter-to-quarter, primarily because of the fact that we have hedge gains and losses. In this case, we had losses as the dollar was weakening, and it created a higher than sort of average impact on the quarter. So that will move around from quarter-to-quarter. But over time, as I had said, we expect that FX will impact us more or less similar to our operating margins. Secondly, in terms of pricing, as I said, yes, we had a number of price increases that took place, both in the first quarter as well as late last year. We had some more in the second quarter, which we didn't have the full effect of through the quarter. So while most of the action has taken place with the exception of, for example, consumer, where we will have some price increases in Q3, we will see -- just because of the fact that we'll have the full effect through the second half, will help us somewhat on pricing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.\nSteven Winoker: Just I want to dive into the core growth experience in the quarter just a little bit. I'm looking at the 4 percentage overall volume in price number here versus the 9 last quarter. And an arguably, a slightly easier comp than last year's. If you kind of go through where -- which segment did Japan impact the most? For example, Electro and Communications, which was down from 17% growth last quarter to 8% growth this quarter. Maybe give us a better sense for where the Japanese experience was felt most.\nDavid Meline: Yes, the biggest impact in Japan was roughly half of the impact of Japan landed in ITB. So you see ITB had very good growth again in the second quarter, which reflects the overall momentum across the business, but it was certainly impacted negatively in Q2 by Japan. The second most significant impact was in the electronics space, which is the combination of the impact on ECB, which, as you've just pointed out, you can attribute part of that decline to what happened in Japan. And also, there was some impact of Japan on the optical business. So part of it is just moving to a more normalized level of sales for ECB that you were talking about, and we're pretty pleased. I mean, we had a 12% first half growth in the business. We expect that to continue, and we think it's reasonable to think about double digits for that business for the year.\nSteven Winoker: Okay, and where did you guys come out on the New Product Vitality Index this quarter?\nGeorge Buckley: It's running in about 32%, Steve. So it's still doing very well. I mean, this is what I said on my talk. You just got to be careful not to so get confused by the underlying growth, how it was impacted by Japan and in particular by optical. It's running still pretty robust, and ties very well with the kind of arithmetic way we're thinking about, the kind of calculus, shall we say, of how we translate those NPVI numbers back into growth. So I don't think in the underlying business, Steve, there's anything really to be concerned about. Japan obviously is going to pass. OPEB adventure [ph] will get a little bit better next year. Optical will do kind of its cyclic thing and H1N1 headwinds cease. So I think the underlying strength of the company is still very, very strong in what was always going to be a little bit tighter quarter for the company.\nSteven Winoker: Right. But it doesn't change your longer-term target outlook of 70[ph]?\nGeorge Buckley: No. Not one iota, not one iota,  Steve.\nSteven Winoker: Okay. And then just a follow-up on the price cost. So it sounds like the cost inflation was 130 basis points, I guess, relative to pricing of 80 basis points in the quarter. And if you're looking at 0% impact, that was for the full year, right?\nDavid Meline: Correct. We're aiming to get the offset on accumulative basis for the calendar year.\nSteven Winoker: So that means you're expecting inflation to abate significantly?\nDavid Meline: Certainly, we're seeing that with the strong move we saw in the end of last year and the first quarter, that, as you know, has started to stabilize. So as we look at on a year-over-year basis, yes, we will see some stabilization. And then as I was saying earlier, with the price increases that have been put in, we'll have the full effect of those in the second half. So obviously, we're expecting to get a better matching of performance to get that offset in the second half. And quite honestly, our early view of '12, would say, we expect to continue to see some raw material pressure. So we'll be looking at what we're going to need moving into next year in terms of managing our prices as well.\nGeorge Buckley: Obviously, the raw material expectations, Steve, is very much tied to what expected demand is. If demand is -- I'm talking about global demand -- if that's high, we'll see probably still continued pressure on commodities and really, the point Dave is making is -- and the indication is we're probably going to be a lot more aggressive on price and make sure we capture that early. It remains to be seen, yet whether some easing of commodity prices will happen. Some have come off of their highs. But I think the actions that we've taken  bottle up better for the second half on margins than they have in the first.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nJohn McNulty: Just Another question on the raw material front. In the past, 3M never seemed to have much of an issue with raw materials. Clearly, this inflationary environment is a little bit different. I'm wondering, what if you had to do in terms of changing how you actually deal with your customers on the topic of raw materials. And how much more in terms of changing do you fundamentally think you have to do so that in the future, if we do assume that raw material inflation continues to be an issue for the next few years, you don't necessarily have to deal with this constant playing of catch up?\nGeorge Buckley: Well, I think the -- first of all, John, no customer, particularly the closer you get to the end market, no customer likes price increases. They don't like getting them. We don't like giving them. We don't like getting them ourselves. So nothing really is changing that in that. But I think the volatile commodity market is sort of owned a new chapter, I think, in a sense it opened a new chapter in customer relations. Customers understand this stuff. They watch it themselves. They're global players. Many of them play in these commodity markets themselves, and they understand the issue of commodity inflation. So we go to them. We have people who are extraordinarily good at this kind of customer relationship. We work on the basis of no surprises. We try to warn customers early. We try to tell them what we're suffering, and therefore, I mean, in the end, it may not necessarily make them anymore sympathetic to our case, but at least they understand it. And it doesn't cause the kind of reactionary negative sort of feelings that you might if you didn't have such good relations. SO I think, John, that it's likely to be a feature of the world going forward I would say. But of course, what it also does for us is there's a constant drumbeat in our company of trying to find ways to reduce the impact of these things, substitute materials, different materials, lower usages of those materials, that kind of  constant pressure cooker that we have in our company to ease the impact that these sort of things have on us and then ultimately, have on our customers. So I don't think that the -- I can't expect it to go away, but I think most of it is being conditioned to the fact that this is a kind of the way of the world. Now to come to the last part of your question, which was how can we avoid this kind of delay. I think it's a structural issue in our company, John, that the procurement is separated from our operating divisions, and also we have relatively long supply chains still. They're shortening but they're still relatively long. And before you see the impact in our P&L accounts, it tends to be a sort of a somewhat several month delay. And about the only way that we can really, I think, improve this is to be a lot more vigorous of putting in prices probably before we actually see the impact in our P&L for these individual divisions. So they may be kind of an operating philosophy change that has to get made by us, but they would be things I would to offer to you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Terry Darling of Goldman Sachs.\nTerry Darling: I guess, follow-up on second half assumptions that you're making in implied in guidance for the optical business, George or Dave. Can you help us with what will you think that business is going to be from an organic perspective in the back half?\nDavid Meline: Yes. What I would say is that very much in line with what we've talked about, but we think that the optical business is going to struggle in the second half. If I look at D&G in total, we gave guidance at the beginning of the year where we thought that the sector would grow in the range of 3% to 7% for the year. Right now, we're thinking for the year that we could be flat as a business. So obviously, that implies some weakening, primarily in the optical business and then a little bit we've also seen that with government spending is being controlled,we've  also seen some weaker performance in our signage business, which we're hopeful will improve, but we're being cautious about that as well.\nTerry Darling: So can you be a little specific on where that down 22% on optical is assumed to be going there? And I guess, the first half versus first half was kind of flat, so to get off this 2Q trend, the second half last year versus the first half, obviously, was -- I guess it was pretty similar, actually, right? So you're thinking you're kind of moving sideways from here. Is that sideways to up a little bit, I guess, just the way the numbers would?\nDavid Meline: Terry, I'm going to have to get back to you. I'm just looking at Q1. We're down 22% in Q1. We would have been down a little bit on dollars in the first quarter as well, but let me come back to you on second half Q2. Yes, the toughest comp in optical actually will be Q3 for us.\nTerry Darling: Okay. And then I guess, on the question of pricing, I just want to be clear. You need to get some incremental pricing in the second half to get to flat for the full year. Did I hear that correct? or you have it where you need at this run rate?\nDavid Meline: Yes. If you look at the raw materials and pricing outlook, a few points. One is that, as we had said last time, we now expect raw material price inflation for the year to be 4% year-over-year. So that's consistent with what we had previously indicated. And as pricing has stabilized in that market, we think the risk of that running higher on us this year is certainly abated. Secondly, we've been driving, aiming towards full price offset in the calendar year, and the businesses, if you look across the businesses, we expect certainly 5 of our 6 segments will deliver on that. The one risk we have is, of course, in the optical business, where we expect to see more price pressure continuing in the second half. So exactly how that plays out, we can't say. But we continue to drive towards parity in that regard.\nTerry Darling: But Dave, just to make sure I understand. If we just talk about the 5 of the 6 segments, are you still confident you'll get to 0 for the year? Do you have the pricing you need at this run rate or do you need to get incremental price in the second half to get to the 0 in those 5 to 6?\nDavid Meline: Yes, we have the pricing we need with the exception of the consumer business, which the nature of that rhythm of price adjustments takes place primarily in Q3.\nTerry Darling: Okay. That is helpful. And then lastly, George...\nGeorge Buckley: Sorry, that 4%, we have about 25% of cost of goods sold -- sorry, 25% of sales is material purchases. So that produces about a 1% drag overall on margins. So if we get a net 1% gain in price, that offsets that. And that's coming more in the second half. So that's why David is saying we expect kind of a more optimistic outlook on pricing margins in the second half.\nTerry Darling: Okay. I wanted to ask about M&A real quick. But maybe I just need to clarify. Within the operating income margin, Dave, did you reduce the corporate expense assumption? Is that corporate expense going to be lower now versus what you thought before for the year?\nDavid Meline: Are you asking for the third? Did you ask me for the third and fourth quarter,Terry?\nTerry Darling: I'm thinking about, I'm just thinking about your full year expectations for the corporate expense item that maps  to the 2Q number that was about $93 million at the segment level. Have you reduced that expectation for the full year? In other words, your corporate costs are coming in better than you thought.\nDavid Meline: I think from an assumption perspective, the right assumption is to assume that will remain as previously guided in terms of the full year.\nTerry Darling: Okay. And then just lastly, George, I'm wondering, on the bigger picture, M&A landscape, the acquisition impact a little less than prior. Is that deal prices getting a little less attractive or some other factor going on there? Maybe just comment on how you're seeing that landscape broadly.\nGeorge Buckley: Well, you've point your finger on a good point, Terry. Prices are high, and you know the way we are. We're conservative. And certainly, we're not going to be chasing expensive tails just for the sake of the getting expensive deals. But for now, we see no reason to come off the forecast that we've made. It may well be that, that will change. But for now, I think the hopper of acquisitions is full. It's rich in the sense of plenty of opportunities. So it's too soon to sort of say anything different than what we said in the past, Terry. But I would agree with your sort of general observation that prices are a little bit higher than they have been here before.  And as is traditional for us, we don't like that.\nMatt Ginter: [Operator Instructions]\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from Citi Investment Research.\nDeane Dray: I would like to get some color on discretionary spending because between CapEx and some of the SG&A investments, it doesn't sound like you're letting up at all. So in light of some of the potential soft patch you're working through, you're certainly not changing the investment framework. So just kind of give us the color as to how you're feeling about these discretionary investments and how that might change in the second half.\nDavid Meline: Okay. So certainly, we've set out a plan where we expect good growth for the business through the calendar year. As we've talked about, we've upped our capital expenditure plans for the calendar year from last year where we invested $1.1 billion. Now we're looking at $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. As you can see, that, that will land more in the second half and then in the first as we have a number of projects that are underway, in particular internationally, where those will start coming on stream either late this or into 2012. So we expect that trend to continue. We don't see any reason that, that's going to change. We expect that our capital investment in terms of as a percent of revenue,  probably continues through '12. And as long as the economy continues, we're going to need that capacity. In terms of investing in the business, we've tried to lay out here to get fairly specific on the SG&A to help you to interpret what is going on in the business.  And what I would say is 2 things: one, is we continue to invest in our growth platforms, which certainly involves taking on additional commitments in terms of staff, in terms of advertising and merchandising. But we also have a discipline in the company, where we expect to get 5% productivity annually. So when you look at the net increase, it's not huge. But if you look at the second level, the fact is as we continue to invest in the business because, as George had articulated, we think this is a pause, but it would be inappropriate for us to be pulling back in a very severe way at the moment.  So there are some businesses, of course, that have their own specific challenges, but generally, we continue to stay on our plan and continue to invest for growth here.\nDeane Dray: And just my follow up was on the comment on insurance recoveries. I know that, that's out of your hands of in terms of what the actual settlements will be, but when you refer to the expectation would recover these losses, were you referring to actual damage or loss of -- business interruption? Could you clarify that, please?\nGeorge Buckley: Well, Deane, on the loss of, actually, equipment, that's an easier claim to make on. On business interruption, that's a little bit more sort of nefarious  because they want some time. The insurance companies want some time to see how sales unfold, did you recover some sales in the future, and of course, you have the argument are those sales fundable [ph], are they the same sale, replacement sales. In the case of the automotive businesses, when you have a specified in component, just because some -- maybe the Japanese are out of the market, maybe Persia [ph]  replaces them with a car, but you may not be specified in on that virtual cost. So we think we can sustain an argument that there was a good loss of business case, and it will take some time. But overall, our insurance people here in the company who are very, very good at this, all the other experiences they have, very good at this. They become increasingly optimistic at a decent percentage recovery of the total loss that we've reported so far.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JP Morgan.\nC. Stephen Tusa: So did you say that Display and Graphics is going to be flat? That's an organic number for the year is what you're talking about?\nDavid Meline: That's correct, yes.\nC. Stephen Tusa: Okay, and so -- but you said the toughest comp is kind of still to come the third quarter, so would you expect a similar organic number as the second quarter in the third quarter? Or is it kind of a consistent third quarter, fourth quarter type of growth?\nDavid Meline: Yes. So what I said, toughest comp is for the optical business. They had a very strong momentum still through Q3 of last year. So as we look at the current dynamics in the business where we're quite cautious on the industry right now, we expect them that the year-over-year will be tougher in Q3 for optical, whereas by Q4 of last year, as you know, we saw quite a significant correction in the optical business. So that comp will be not quite as difficult.\nC. Stephen Tusa: okay, because, I mean, to get back to flat after another tough comp in the third quarter, I mean, you're going to need a pretty solid double-digit increase in the fourth quarter for the segment assuming the kind of optical is the key driver. Is that kind of the way you guys are thinking about it?\nDavid Meline: What we know is that if you look at D&G in total, only about half of optical is D&G. So we continue to have good momentum in terms of the CG business, our commercial graphics. We expect that traffic signage, even though we've had some delays in government spending, that will continue to grow for us. And then, as I say, the comp on OSD, on optical will not be as quite as difficult in the fourth quarter.\nC. Stephen Tusa: Okay. And then just rounding out that line of questioning, it looks like so just looking down the segments and the other segments in your guidance that Industrial, Transportation, Electro doing better than expected, Health Care and Consumer and Office looks like you need to look to get to your previous annual guidance. You need a little bit of an acceleration here in back half. Is that the right way to think about it? Or are those businesses   kind of  steady state?\nDavid Meline: Yes, if I could kind, Steve, good question. So where we have the very good momentum and if you look at compared to our full year organic volume guidance that we've given last year, certainly, ECB and ITB, we could see them coming a little bit above the high end of that 7% to 9% guidance we gave last year. Safety and security has got good momentum here, coming into the second half, and they've also lapped the H1N1. So they could come at the top or even a little bit above as where we had indicated, which was mid-single digits. And then consumer and Health Care, if you look at our original guidance, 5% to 7% on the year, we think they'll come in towards the low end of that range, which does, as you point out, indicate a little bit of a recovery, which, for us, looks reasonable consumer. We're coming into a season where, while it's early to say, we foresee some recovery there. In Health Care, specifically, we saw second quarter was running similar to the first in terms of the medical and dental business. We were encouraged by the continued sales there. We had a specific issue in Health Care in Q2, where our drug delivery systems business had some delays in some contracts. So that pulled down the result in Q2, which we don't think is going to repeat in the second half. So I think your comments are right on Consumer and Health Care. And then D&G, we talked about.\nMatt Ginter: Steve, can I clarify one thing. This is Matt. I think what Dave had quoted volume expectations for D&G, we're talking organic volume, okay? So remember, D&G absorbs some price down every quarter. So if you're looking at total organic sales dollars, including price, you may be on a slightly different basis than he was. And we can clarify offline.\nC. Stephen Tusa: I'm just talking about the D&G negative 10 this quarter, so will it be better or worse than that on the third quarter?\nMatt Ginter: I was talking about the full year guidance. So Let's cover this one offline, Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies & Co.\nLaurence Alexander: Two quick questions. One, what is your read on the pace of August shutdowns in terms of year-over-year comparisons particularly in automotive? And secondly, has raw material inflation started to affect the CapEx or the capital cost for new project? That is if you were doing the same amount of CapEx next year, how much would you need to lift the CapEx budget to do same amount of projects?\nDavid Meline: Okay, on the first question on automotive, certainly, if I start with Japan, which is impacting obviously, globally, we're seeing a recovery in OEM volume in the third quarter.  We expect they'll still be slightly below their original plan. So in the 90% to 95% range, and that will pop up in the fourth quarter slightly above their original plan. The issue for, as you probably know, the issue for the OEMs in Japan right now is that while their supply chains are back in good order, they're facing limitations on the availability of power. So we see that pattern in Japan in the second half. In terms of rest of the world, certainly, we observed that the schedules are stronger in the third quarter. If you look on a year-over-year basis, it's quite impressively stronger partly due to the fact that the market is recovering. And secondly, partly due to the fact that there's a market share shift as people are quite happy to fill in where the Japanese OEMs have left some gaps. In terms of -- could you repeat the second question, Laurence?\nLaurence Alexander: How much raw material inflation would be flowing through the capital spending budget if we're thinking about 2012 compared to 2011? For the same number of projects, how much could you have to lift the CapEx budget?\nMatt Ginter: You talking just inflation on capital cost themselves, Laurence?\nGeorge Buckley: On the materials, pledges to the capital budget, Laurence, is that what you're seeking -- what you're asking?\nLaurence Alexander: And how it's flowing through to your total -- basically, last cycle we saw capital spending budgets move sharply higher as we move later in the cycle. Are you seeing any signs of that happening yet?\nDavid Meline: No. Yes, certainly, what we've seen is -- as you know, we're increasing our capital investment this year by $200 million to $400 million from the prior period, specifically because we've got a number of areas where we run into  capacity limitations. We do foresee that trend in terms of absolute spending to continue to rise. Would I call it an expectation of a sharp increase in 2012? No, I would say a steady increase. And what we observe is kind of a sweet spot for the company given our level of the vertical integration here is typically in around the 5% range in terms of percent of revenue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner of Barclays Capital.\nScott Gaffner: Just wanted to start with a follow-up on the acquisition front. So you took out the unannounced M&A out of the acquisitions. I'm just wondering you had $2 billion to $3 billion budgeted for M&A for the year. If some of these acquisitions don't come to the table, I mean, where could we look to put that money to work outside of M&A?\nGeorge Buckley: Well, I mean, the answer to the question is an obvious one, Scott. It will provide other opportunities to do other things with that capital. But without getting ourselves sort of out in front over our SKUs as we sometimes do in this part of the world. We have a pretty full hopper of opportunities. So I think it's too soon to give up on that, Scott. But as we said earlier to one of our colleagues,  prices are little bit tougher, they're a little bit higher. There seems to be more optimism on selling prices by the sellers. And so we will be prudent in the way that we invest our money, your money actually. But I think it's too soon to tell. It's too soon to sort of giving up on that and deciding what plan B is. But obviously, if plan B came along, we're always going to prefer internal investments, and buybacks and dividends are always be an important part of what we do. And they will certainly get consideration if and when that time comes, Scott. But I think it's too early to say right now.\nScott Gaffner: Okay, and then just looking at the margin guidance for 2011, we've got about 30 basis points increase year-over-year at the high-end and maybe 70 basis points down year-over-year on the low-end. What gives you confidence that you can actually take the margins a little bit higher in 2012?\nDavid Meline: Yes, well, that's right. There's some specific items that we can see right now would be tailwinds for us next year. For example, if, in fact, interest rates stay at the levels where we started the year and we see return on assets as we have in our plans, that would, then, on a year-over-year basis give us about $100 million tailwind next year in terms of pension expense, which would help our margins. The second most obvious factor to us right now is the fact that we expect Japan, which is being -- which is clearly a drag on the company this year, will be  at least neutral. And quite honestly, we're optimistic that we'll see that become a tailwind for us next year. And then the third factor is we intend to continue to grow the business. And if you look at the incremental margins from additional sales that the company generates, it's quite impressive. And we have the choices, then, to choose to either reinvest that in the business, maintaining margins or depending on where we are, also allowing that to manage to the bottom line as well.\nGeorge Buckley: So Scott, it's not only the volume increases, probable volume increases in Japan, which would get us leveraged. But Japan is fairly strongly accretive to the overall company in margins. So you'd see that impact coming forward, too. So there's quite a number of these things that we see. There's, of course, by that time, we ought to have been caught upon on this price raw materials issue as well. It remains to be seen. Nobody really knows where that's going to go next year, the prices versus raw material game. But I think there's 3 or 4 or maybe 5 different things that are very positive in the margin accretion game.\nDavid Meline: But I would say we're just beginning the planning process right now, so it's really early for us to talk about where we're going to land in 2012. And there are a lot of pluses and minuses. There's a lot of uncertainty about what's going to happen with the economy. What we do know is that we're making progress in terms of driving towards our long-term goals. And so we've got good momentum in the business, but there's obviously, still a lot of open questions. I think the right framing for us is to think about the company delivering margins in the range that we've demonstrated over the last several years, and really, we continue to focus on confirming that we can have a sustainably higher growth rate. So on the margin, we're tending to look at where those opportunities are to ensure that we can deliver on that higher level of growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.\nUnknown Analyst -: This is actually Ron C. Billingham[ph] ,  sitting in for David. It looks like volumes declined to 3% from 6% in Europe. Could you just comment on what was driving that? Give us a bit of color.\nDavid Meline: Yes. In Europe, what we did see in the second quarter and you're absolutely right, we saw an overall softening take place in the economy, which affected the business. We continue to be quite, honestly, very pleased in terms if you look at the organic volume performance versus the industrial production there. We're satisfied that we're continuing to gain share in the overall market. But what clearly was the case is for us, at least, the European business was impacted by softness in some of the markets, including in the U.K. and in Southern Europe in particular. So we had those impacts. We also had a contract in one of the divisions that ended. So we had some specific reductions in sales. And if you look at the drug delivery systems business that I talked about earlier, a big portion of their business is in Europe. So we saw some delays in contract awards, which flowed through the European results.\nGeorge Buckley: We've had lumpy sales in some of those contract-based -- project-based activities.\nUnknown Analyst -: Actually, that's very helpful. And lastly, just on growth in Germany, could you comment on what you guys saw in Q2 year-over-year?\nGeorge Buckley: Well, Germany remains very strong. It's one of the -- perhaps, one of the models that other countries ought to use. Obviously, we gained some currency there. But it remains very, very strong, been running in total in the 20s. So it's really been quite remarkable.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR Capital Markets.\nAjay Kejriwal: Just on the Health care Margins, so it sounds like you had some lumpiness and acquisitions probably hurt margins in the quarter. What's the outlook from here? And I know in the past, you  have called out Health Care as a high 20s, this probably the sustainable rate. But any expectations there for the second half? Should we expect Health Care margins around these levels or some modest improvement?\nDavid Meline: Yes, we -- I think you've anticipated the answer, which we think that the high 20s is really the sweet spot for the business right now, balancing in terms of delivering to the bottom line and ensuring that we're investing appropriately, both in terms of new technologies and products, as well as we've talked about in the past, the key focus for our Health Care business is to continue to expand their footprint, in particular, focused on emerging markets. So the answer would be, I think from a planning perspective, continuing at this kind of margin level into the second half is the right way to think about it.\nAjay Kejriwal: Good. And then very quickly on ITB. So as these Japan issues resolve in the second half and volume comes back, is it fair to say margin improves sequentially from here? Or are there other things we should be thinking about?\nDavid Meline: What we see right now, as I've said earlier, we see good momentum in the ITB business. It's a business that was affected by raw material cost increases, a little bit more severely than most of the others. They've done a good job in terms of putting in pricing to offset that. So we think they've dealt with the -- at least, the near term issues on raw materials. What's impacted, in particular, their margin here in the first half, including the second quarter was a combination of the impact of Japan, which is, as I mentioned, an important business for ITB, as well as they've done a couple of acquisitions and we had some purchase accounting that was impacting us here in the second quarter, as well as some start-up transitions. So with Japan, waning, at least, becoming neutral to the business and then with the acquisitions gaining momentum, we think those would be tailwinds for the business in the second half.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura Securities.\nShannon O'Callaghan: On the share repurchase plan, maybe I missed what you said for the year, but I think initially, it was supposed to be $0.05 to $0.10 of tailwind in the guidance this year. I mean, are you expecting the share count to still trend lower from here?\nDavid Meline: In terms of share count, yes. If we kind of walk through that, what we've said at the beginning of the year is from a gross buyback perspective, we would do $2 billion to $2.5 billion. We did $1.4 billion in the first half. So obviously, trending at the high end of that range. What's also the case is we said that on a net basis, we would do I think $1 billion to $1.3 billion. And what we are seeing is more reissuances than originally planned for in the year. And therefore, in terms of the average share count, it is correct that we expect the average share count to be somewhat higher this year than we had originally indicated.\nShannon O'Callaghan: And then George, I just want to maybe flush out your comments about the bifurcation of the LCD TV market and get your feeling. You mentioned something about new entrants, and just give us a sense where do you think your attachment rate bottoms and the what is this -- where do you see yourself playing out in kind of the new mold as that market develops?\nGeorge Buckley: Yes, it's an interesting question, Shannon. It really is an interesting question because everybody is trying to sort of figure out where this market goes. Is it something that kind of -- everybody sort of has a rough to bottom. Will the market sort of stabilize, mature and have some sort of more of middle ground approach? But I think ultimately, the quality set manufacturers are talking about trying to find ways to add more features and not be quite so much there in that sort of down and dirty area and try to use some of their brand power, some of their creative power, get help from guys like us to sort of by the way to differentiate them. Because really what always happen is as markets come to the bottom, Shannon, is as you kind of plumb the depths, a substantial number of customers say, you know what? I don't like this plumb depths. I want some more features. And so manufacturers, set manufacturers in particular, are kind of preparing for that. And so I think that the way that this attachment rate goes, it probably stabilizes in the late teens. I think probably -- I mean, if we're optimistic, it might be 20, but I think it's in that late teens area, probably dedicated more to the performance segment of the business. And we'll have to see whether continued innovation allows us to push back attachment rates in that business. Remember, we're really speaking about TVs here. There's not an issue in the handhelds or monitors, and I think even in some of the technology develops in monitors where nonpowered monitors, USB port powered monitors need film. So some of those pushes, Shannon, will alter the kind of complexity of the business and  maybe help us a bit with monitors.  But I think all in all, this is a business that will settle down and TVs, probably in that late teens area. The blended business being in the 20s margin. The challenge always for all of us and not just us for you, I know, is when you look at integrated over a year or over a year and a half, average over that period of time, this ends up being a very good business, $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion, 20 points, 25 points margin in that kind of spread. You'd see it. Then, what's not to like? What's not to like sometimes is the ups and downs. But it has, over the years now, become a much smaller portion of our business. And its ability to sort of impact and really hurt us in any meaningful way has now wind. We just take a look at this quarter alone. Really tough time for optical, but yet the company delivered on target earnings and also, with Japan, headwinds and some general economic tightening. So I think it shows -- it bodes well, generally speaking, for the company, there is optical becomes less and less a factor, and that business becomes closer to maturity. Stability will, I think, ensue in that market. The market players will establish themselves in a quality end, that will be the place we play. And I think overall, probably in the next 2 to 3 years, we'll see this business stabilize into a much more regular kind of commoditized consumer-type pattern with some down price but not with the kind of volatility and bouncing around that we see today.\nMatt Ginter: Thank, everybody for joining us, spending  time this morning. We look forward to talking to you very soon. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line."}, {"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 1, "year": 2011, "date": "2011-04-27 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, April 26, 2011. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nMatt Ginter: Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2011 business review. With me today are George Buckley, 3M Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Meline, our recently appointed Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Today, we will review our first quarter results, along with an updated outlook for the rest of this year. A PowerPoint presentation accompanies today's conference call, which you can access on 3M's Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Today's slide presentation and the audio replay will be archived on our website for an extended period of time. Take a moment, if you would, to read the forward-looking statements on Slide 2. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of our most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. So let's begin today's review. I'll turn the program over to George, and please turn to Slide #3.\nGeorge Buckley: Thank you very much, Matt, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. From the numbers, you'll clearly see that first quarter was again a very good one for 3M. We posted over 15% top line growth, and if we correct for Japan and H1N1 effects, organic growth was running at about 10.5%. So we continue to post growth rates which are among the highest in the company's long history. We delivered $1.49 EPS in Q1, which is an all-time high for the company in the first quarter, and all of this was done at a time when Japan's troubles cost us about $0.03 per share or about 70 bps net of sales growth, all of which was organic, plus of course the additional challenges that we saw in the Middle East. The unrest there cost us a little under $10 million in sales but nothing significant. The growth rates were high across the board, with E&C, Electro and Communications, leading the way at 21% growth; and Industrial transportation almost equaling it at 20% growth. I&TB will be about $10 billion segment for us in 2011, and to see a unit grow this fast in industrial space is quite remarkable. 5 of our 6 reporting segments reported double-digit sales increases in the quarter, with Display and Graphics also very close to double digits at 9% total growth. Currency clearly helped us to be sure, but even without that, 4 of the 6 reporting segments reported double-digit local currency growth. Emerging markets were again stellar, with sales up 24% led by developing Asia. We saw double-digit sales growth in all geographic regions, including 10.2% in the United States. We had 47 countries in our portfolio, including the United States that reported double-digit sales growth. And can you believe that Germany's sales growth came in at 24.3% in March, just slightly behind China. This is, I think, a real testament to the progress that we are making toward being a higher growth company. We've now had growth in excess of 9% for 6 consecutive quarters, which is a firm indication that we're cracking the growth code. Unlike most other experiments in growth, I think we've proven we can grow multiple businesses at once, not just those that happened to be in naturally high growth spaces. This is being done by the innovation of our people. I think we're also proving that we can grow all the way through the economic cycle. Companies can acquire growth, yes, but I'm still very much a believer that organic growth is the true test of the company's long-term innate value and capability. Unless there are no unforeseen geopolitical problems, it seems we will exceed $30 billion in sales in 2011 for the first time in our history. Our acquisition strategy continues to advance, too. In the first quarter, we closed 2 sizable deals, Alpha Beta, which is Taiwanese tape manufacturer; and Winterthur Technologies AG, a supplier of precision bonded grinding technologies. Both will give us new competitive capabilities that will help customers and make us even more competitive. Other recent acquisitions such as Cogent, Attenti, and Arizant are all progressing very nicely and all ahead of plan. In the quarter, acquisitions added 3% to our sales growth total. It wasn't all plain sailing in the quarter, as pensions, OPEB, purchase accounting, damage in Japan and raw material prices have chipped away a bit of our growth margins, but most of these items we knew ahead of time, and they will ease or pass away as the year goes on. I'll just remind you again quickly here that optical systems has an industry normal annual price down environment that is baked into these numbers. Selling prices turned positive inside the quarter for the company in total. Turning to the first quarter highlights. Organic volumes are up 9% even with the adjustment that I mentioned earlier. We maintained operating margins at 21.6%, with all businesses coming in at or above 21%, a phenomenal result in consistency. Operating income was up 9% on the year to $1.6 billion, another first quarter record, or up 17% on an underlying basis when we eliminate nonoperational items such as Japan, H1N1 and pensions. David will address this topic in detail in a few minutes. The quarter also included the announcement of 3M's 53rd consecutive annual dividend increase. And in addition, the board authorized a $7 billion share repurchase in February. For the quarter, our gross share repurchases were $680 million, a great start. Again, it was a tremendous start for the year. Let me quickly take you through some of the performances of our business. Our largest business, Industrial and Transportation, turned in an absolutely superb quarter, with sales growth of 20% and operating income up 17%. Renewable Energy continued on a roll with sales up 68%. Aerospace was up 38%, and our core abrasives and industrial adhesives and tapes were up 31% and 23%, respectively. Industrial achieved record quarterly operating income of $516 million, with operating margins of 21.1%. The acquisitions I mentioned earlier, Alpha Beta and Winterthur, were both in this business. I want here to acknowledge the creative work of one of our dear friends, Tony Stokes, the Head of our Automotive division, we all met at our last investor meeting, who sadly passed away 10 days ago of a heart attack. And he delivered 16% in what became his final quarter. Tony took a division with relatively low growth, and with the force of imagination, inspiration and innovation, made it a regular double-digit performer even with these Japanese effects. Thank you very much, Tony. We're all going to miss you. Healthcare sales rebounded nicely, up 13% in the quarter, with double-digit increases in every geographic region. Operating income jumped 7% to $369 million, with operating margins at 29.4%. Here too acquisitions were important, contributing over 5% to sales. The Arizant acquisition is going particularly well, outperforming both sales and profit expectations, and the integration is tracking well ahead of plan. Consumer and Office achieved sales growth of 10%, including a little over 2% from acquisitions. When you see what's happening in consumer companies around the world and the office environment broadly, it's really quite remarkable. Operating income was $215 million. Importantly, Consumer did well in Asia Pacific and Latin America, 2 areas of high growth investment focus for us, with a 31% sales increase in Asia and an 18% increase in Latin America. So our investments are clearly making a positive impact. These investments are reflected in COB margins, which are down 2.5 points from last year's high levels. So while we're seeing some short-term margin erosion, the key for us is to remain committed to invest and drive this business for the longer term. In addition, COB, like other businesses absorb raw materials increases in the quarter, also affecting margins. On the product front, the new Filtrete Water Station received the Silver Edison Award for innovation in the consumer packaged goods household category. Sales rose 9% in Display and Graphics, with our Commercial Graphics business and newly formed architecture markets leading the way. In optical systems, LCD TV demand is softer, as smartphones and tablet PC demand remain very robust. Knowing the fascination with optical, I'll expand on this in a few minutes. Overall, the segment posted income of $230 million, up 9%, with operating margins a strong 24.4%. One acquisition note, we just announced the acquisition of Original Wraps Inc., a small company in the commercial graphics space. This company specializes in the design of personalized graphics of vehicles, which is turning into another growth opportunity for us. Safety, Security and Protection Services posted a sales increase of 14%, which would've been over 20% if it were not for H1N1 comps. Operating income was up 9% to $199 million, with operating margins at 21.4%. We expect this unit to be a sizable beneficiary of increased protective equipment sales when rebuilding in Japan begins in earnest. Also, in the quarter, the head of SSPS, our good friend, Jean Lobey, announced his plans to retire on June 1. I'm very sad about this, since Jean has done an absolutely superb job building this business, and we wish him the very best. Thank you, Jean, again. I know his successor, Julie Bushman, will continue Jean's good work. FYI, Julie was the former Head of our Occupational Health business reporting to Jean. Finally, Electro and Communications' momentum continued strong in the quarter, with sales up 21% and record operating income of $178 million, also up 21%. Within this segment, our electronics markets materials posted its sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit local currency growth. Needless to say, we're very happy with the performance of this business, and we continue to invest in it. For example, in the quarter, we announced an expanded global capacity for optically clear adhesives to support the growth of consumer electronic devices, and 3M and Quanta formed a new company to manufacture projected capacity of touch sensors for the personal computing market. We showed you some of the exciting new inventions coming your way in our recent investor meeting in St. Paul. In addition, EMD, our Electrical Markets business, which serves the power utility and infrastructure markets, also posted double-digit gains. There's lots of excitement in Electro and Communications these days. So that's a quick run-through of our business segments, and before I turn the call over to our new CFO, David Meline, let me once again salute the many business contributions of Pat Campbell over the last 10 years or so. He's an important figure in 3M's history, and has been absolutely essential to the transformation of 3M into a faster growing enterprise. Thank you very much, Pat, and we wish you a long and happy retirement. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to David Meline. David?\nDavid Meline: Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. I'm glad I had the chance to meet many of you at our meeting here in March in St. Paul, and I look forward to meeting more of you in the future. Meanwhile, thanks for joining today, and please turn to Chart #5. On a GAAP reported basis, first quarter earnings were $1.49 per share. This is an all-time record for any first quarter, adjusting for the onetime pharma gain in 2007 and a healthy 16% increase over last year's $1.29 per share. As a reminder, last year's results included a onetime noncash income tax charge of $84 million or $0.11 a share resulting from Medicare Part D changes in the U.S. Patient Protection Act. We exceeded our own earnings expectations in the quarter, a good result considering that Japan was an unanticipated headwind. We estimate that earthquake-related disruptions hurt our earnings by approximately $0.03 per share, which represents lost business in Japan plus our best estimate of impact in other countries. The earnings impact included in lost profit on reduced sales plus some onetime write-offs of inventory and fixed assets. We expect additional Japan-related headwinds in Q2, which are factored into our outlook, of course. We assume that these headwinds will wane during the second half of 2011 and we could see additional sales opportunities in businesses such as protective respirators, traffic safety solutions and commercial graphics to name a few. George will have more to say about Japan in our forward outlook in just a bit.  Overall, this was a very good quarter for 3M, and we are off to a strong start in 2011. Let me walk you through the details, please turn to Slide #6. If you have followed 3M for a while, you know that our financial objectives call for accelerated sales growth, coupled with stable but premium margins and returns on capital. I think this quarter's results fit that description quite well. Sales in the quarter rose 15%, with 9 points coming from higher organic volumes, 3 points from acquisitions and another 3 points from favorable currency movements. Selling prices rose slightly in Q1, but importantly, they improved each month during the quarter as our businesses have stepped up aggressively to help to offset raw material headwinds. As a reminder to you, price down is a normal part of the business in a few select 3M businesses, Optical being a prime example.  Excluding Optical, selling prices increased nearly 1 percentage point in the quarter. With respect to organic volumes, we achieved nearly 9% growth in the first quarter even with some headwinds. First, Japan, which hurt sales by just under 1 point year-on-year, the other material headwind was H1N1. In last year's first quarter, we estimate H1N1 added approximately $45 million to sales, which did not repeat in 2011. Adjusting for these factors, organic volumes rose 10.4% in the quarter for a multiple of 1.8x global IPI. We continue to be encouraged by the broad-based nature of our growth. Over the past few years, we have seen steady improvement in the number of businesses that are growing their sales. This gives us confidence in the robustness of our portfolio versus past periods, when growth was limited to 1 or 2 of our businesses. In fact, nearly all of 3M's 40 divisions in nearly 70 countries operated with positive first quarter sales growth. We expanded sales in every region of the world in the quarter, with Asia Pacific up 21%, Latin America up 23%, Europe up 13%, and the U.S. and Canada both up 10 percentage points. And as George mentioned, all 6 of our business segments expanded sales during the quarter. Gross margins declined by 1 point year-on-year, which was largely due to higher raw material inflation. The good news is our businesses have been raising prices with more to go. For the full year 2011, selling price increases are expected to offset raw material inflation. The positive momentum that we saw in Q1 gives me confidence that we are on the right track. March selling prices were up versus February, February was up versus January, and January was up versus December. So we're trending in the right direction. SG&A and R&D rose 16% and 17%, respectively, with increases primarily attributable to continued growth-oriented investment, currency translation and acquisitions along with higher pension and OPEB expense. on a percent-to-sales basis, SG&A and R&D were similar to first quarter 2010 levels. Operating income rose 9% to $1.6 billion for the quarter, and margins were down about 1 point to 21.6%. Underlying first quarter income growth was much stronger, however, after considering a few transient headwinds. If we adjust for Japan, H1N1 and pension and OPEB expense headwinds, operating income rose a strong 17% year-on-year. The first quarter tax rate was 28.6%, up 2.5 points year-on-year, excluding the Medicare Part D related tax charge in the first quarter of 2010. Last year's rate benefited from a corporate reorganization that allowed us to increase ownership in one of our international subsidiaries. These benefits did not repeat in the first quarter of 2011. We continue to expect the full year 2011 tax rate of approximately 29.5%. GAAP net income rose 16% in Q1 or 7% excluding the Medicare Part D tax expense increase in the first quarter of 2010. Again, adjusting for Japan, H1N1 and pension and OPEB expense, GAAP net income would've grown by 24% year-on-year. Please turn to Slide #7. As I mentioned on the prior slide, operating margins were 21.6% for the quarter, a level that many industrial-based companies can only aspire to, but margins were 120 basis points below prior-year levels, and I would like to articulate the primary reasons why: First, organic growth of nearly 9% boosted first quarter margins by about 80 basis points. Raw material inflation net of selling price increases hurt our operating margins by 90 basis points. So net-net, organic volume growth leverage and inflation essentially offset one another in the first quarter. Business disruptions related to the Japan earthquake hurt operating margins by 40 basis points. This effect is expected to increase in Q2, but in the second half, we expect it will pass. We believe that our automotive OEM and consumer electronics related businesses will absorb the lion's share of this impact. Higher pension and OPEB expense penalize margins by 70 basis points year-on-year. This will hurt margins in all quarters of 2011, but using assumed asset returns and current interest rate levels, pension expense is expected to decline in 2012. Please turn to Slide #8, where I will review the first quarter cash flow highlights. Free cash flow was $502 million in the first quarter, with cash conversion of 46%. This was lower than our typical first quarter, which averages around 70% cash conversion. Conversion was lower for 3 primary reasons: One, we invested in an additional $168 million in working capital in the quarter in support of growth. In the receivables area, for example, it is not unusual to see receivables rise late in the first quarter only to subsequently fall in April as payments are remitted. That is precisely what happened this quarter, given that March was such a strong sales month. Taxes also had a negative impact on conversion year-on-year. We received an $82 million tax refund in last year's first quarter that did not repeat this year. Also recall that in the first quarter of 2010, we booked an $84 million tax charge related to changes to Medicare Part D. This was a noncash charge, which therefore benefited last year's free cash conversion. Finally, capital expenditures totaled $231 million, up 47% or $74 million year-on-year. Our full year CapEx estimate remains $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. Importantly, we are directing more of our capital investments towards international operations and developing markets in particular, and a larger portion of spending is directly aimed at new growth programs. Despite a lower Q1 conversion, we expect to achieve 100% conversion for the full year 2011. We spent $680 million on share repurchase in the first quarter, so a nice step-up here. Finally, we invested nearly $500 million on acquisitions, primarily the closing of Winterthur and Alpha Beta. That is the quick summary of our first quarter business performance. At this point, I will turn the call program back to George. Please turn to Slide #9.\nGeorge Buckley: Thank you very much, David. I'd now like to give you some flavor on the outlook for the coming quarters, as best we can see it at this stage. Let's first speak for a moment about the Japan situation. Last year, Japan was about 25 -- $2.5 billion in sales for us, so it was around 9% of our total. It will interest you to know that Japan had been clocking around 9% sales growth prior to the earthquake. While we finished down 3% in organic local currency sales for the month of March, sales was still up 5% in local currency for the first quarter, fully showing you both the underlying sales momentum there and the impact of the earthquake. The human cost to us was blessedly small, with no employees or family members losing their lives and only about 10 families losing their homes. We've done everything possible to help these people. Thankfully, few of them, without forgetting the scale and the tragedy to them as individuals or to their families. The earthquake and its tragic aftermath ended up costing us about $27 million in the quarter or $0.03 per share, and we estimate that it will cost us about $140 million for the year or somewhere between $0.10 and $0.13 per share depending on the geographic and end market mix of sales. These are worldwide impact numbers, with only about half of the direct impact being in Japan. Industries which are affected around the globe are obviously those with Japan as part of their supply chain. But on a positive note, the Northeastern Japan ports are now open, and there appears to be some basis for optimism about a gradual bettering situation in TEPCO's Fukushima Power Plant, with cold shutdown at the reactors forecast by year's end. We've also purchased backup standby power generators for the 3 largest plants to ease any concerns about electricity supply. So logically, we expect the impact of Q2 to be worse than it was in Q1, so things will probably get a little bit worse due to Japan before they get better. This is partly because there's a full quarter's effect in Q2, and partly because the component shortages will likely become worse for a while as the quarter unfolds and existing stocks are drawn down. However, Japan is mobilizing well. We expect this to be the worst of it, and the negative effects will gradually abate as we move into the second half of 2011. We think the Japan impact in Q2 is in the range of $0.07 to $0.08 per share, with about half of this total coming from our Automotive business. Q3 might be a small negative, but Q4 should become gradually positive. So net-net, a small impact in the second half of the year. We'll see new compensating demand from reconstruction in telecoms and electricity distribution, construction and safety apparatus, plus rapid refilling of automotive and distribution pipelines, and we all know the power that that has to drive results. We're focused -- focusing on organizing development now. Not everyone agrees with me, but worries about the Japan's impact on the world economy should also be significantly more muted in H2, second half, as new sources of component supply are found by Japanese companies or alternatively where their competitors take share and fill the same sales gap with their own finished goods. I think the net of all of this is that the Japan situation, while fluid and challenging in parts, seems more than absorbable and manageable within our guidance. So far, we have not included the benefits of any insurance recoveries or receivables in our earnings forecast or any strong rebuilding recovery in Japan, which may begin sometime in the third or fourth quarter and possibly wash over into all of next year. But we know historically that restocking will begin before -- a little bit before demand. So this is another upside for the year. As we all know, success in insurance claims is a duel between the tenacity of the insured and the terms and conditions of the policies and doggedness of the insurers. So we're taking a conservative stance. History suggests, however, that we'll be successful to a reasonable degree. We know that our Optical Systems did very well in the first quarter, with volumes up nearly 12%, but also the TV channel, which is about 40% of Optical Systems division sales, is still a little full with about 3 weeks excess inventory in the channel. History tells us that retailers and set manufacturers will correct this excess inventory quickly with production cuts plus the impact of model change that will take place in the second quarter. But in contrast, the largest set manufacturer, Samsung, only broke even in this business in Q4 and lost money in the first quarter. It is forecasting higher sales in the second half. So the correction may not be that severe, but for planning purposes, we've allowed some volume contraction from the loss of LCD TV attachment, which frequently happens in the ebb and flow of competition and pricing in that channel. The institutionalized 10% to 15% annual price down is already included in our numbers. I think it's important here to make a point about the increasing strength of 3M's broad portfolio of businesses. We're no longer the 1 or 2 trick pony that we once were. When we feel confident enough to take up our estimates for the year even in the face of the scenario I just described, it's clear that Optical does not hold the same weight relative to our businesses that it once did. In 2005, Optical was roughly 8% of the company sales and 18% of company profits. Today, due to growth in so many new areas, it's about 5.7% of our sales and only 7% of our profits. Still important, it's only about 1/3 of the economic impact on 3M that it once was. It's still volatile and hard to forecast, yes, but now I think it's time to stop worrying only about Optical. The balance of Display and Graphics business is also seeing very robust demand. Commercial graphics is very strong, with sales well north of 20% in the first quarter, and this is nearly always a precursor for bettering economic times. For the year, even with Japan, we expect that operating margins will be between 21.5% and 23%, with the lower end largely a function of potential onetime cost on deals not yet identified or closed. There's no question that for now overall U.S. manufacturing seems to be weathering the economic storm reasonably well and a weak dollar provides opportunities for export. I think that 3M's growth and that of the U.S. economy is still going strongly lead by emerging markets. The demand for construction equipment is also robust. On housing, just when you think it is at the bottom, it seems to get worse. So I think housing prices will still have some way to fall this year, but ultimately, at some point, that will attract more buyers. That will be the start of the housing recovery. In the United States and parts of Western Europe, we know that the bugaboo still remains high unemployment. Automotive demand remains vibrant, with non-JOM manufacturers probably able to apply a lot of the lost volume from Japanese sources. We're also seeing strong sales growth in renewable energy, whose growth rates were up 68% in the first quarter.  Abrasives, automotive, air and water filtration and electronics generally, particularly in adhesives and high-tech fluids and multi-touch technologies all grew strongly. The growth is really broad-based with too many areas of growth to mention specifically, and it's innovation that's driving it. I don't want to seem like Jeremiah, and I mean the prophet here, not the bullfrog, but I can also see a similar set of economic circumstances emerging to those that we saw in mid-2008, with a weak dollar, rapidly increasing oil prices, higher commodity prices and treasury yields, et cetera. But on a positive side, liquidity is plentiful, and banking is far more sound. On a certain degree, it's a wide range of forecasts and outlooks. For example, the latest global insight forecasts called for global IPI to fall significantly from 5.5% to 4.2%. We have to imagine that a combination of Japan, commodity inflation, the Middle East, persistent high unemployment must take money out of the world economy and contribute to somewhat slower growth, but ultimately, only history will prove some prognosticator correct. I keep on hoping for a quarter without this level of uncertainty, but that doesn't seem to be likely for a while. We're monitoring the situation very closely, and with so many unknowns, we're staying conservative, as you might expect from us. Our motto is to prepare and invest physically for the upside but to prepare mentally for any downside, and we're certainly more upbeat than some. As George Bernard Shaw said, \"The best way to predict the future is to go out and create it,\" and that's the business that we're in. Based on the underlying performance of the company, on our momentum, on currency impacts and high levels of new products, when we net it all this together, we remain much more optimistic and pessimistic about the year. The net of all of our reasoning is that we expect the organic sales growth to accelerate from a range of 5.5% to 7.5% to a new range of 6% to 7.5% including the 1% drag from Japan. So that moves the underlying top end of our range x Japan up to 8.5%. So for 2011 in total, with acquisitions priced and a more positive currency outlook, we're expecting double-digit growth in revenues. Demand has been so strong in some new product areas that we may need to add fixed capital there to keep up. Earnings are now expected to be in the $6.05 to $6.25 range even after the Japan impact, but we make no allowance for the positive upside of insurance recoveries. Thank you very much, everybody, for your attention. We'll now be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies & Co.\nLaurence Alexander: I guess 2-part question. First, on raw materials. What's your inflation assumption is for the year? And are you seeing any end markets or regions where you're starting to get concerned about demand disruption because of inflationary cost pressures?\nDavid Meline: Yes. On RM [raw materials] inflation for the year, we're expecting around 4%, which is what we experienced in the first quarter, and we expect that will continue. In terms of end market impacts, we have not seen the impact -- even though we have varying levels of inflation going on, we haven't seen that curtailing the strength of demand for us at this time.\nGeorge Buckley: So, so far, so good, Laurence.\nLaurence Alexander: Thank you.\nDavid Meline: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Morgan Stanley.\nScott Davis: George, one of your last comments of the presentation just related to need to add capacity, and I want to dig in to that a little bit. If we think about the last upcycle, you did spend a fair amount and added a fair amount of capacity in areas that were tight at the time. How do you balance adding additional capacity with some of the other options out there, and maybe those options include just: a, raising prices or capturing a little bit margin; or b, just putting more emphasis on fixing some of the supply chain issues that you've had on a legacy basis and freeingd up some capacity that way? Is there some granularity you can provide for us there, please?\nGeorge Buckley: I think investments our growth, Scott, has always proven to be the best return. We're getting 23% returns or thereabouts on -- and maybe even higher than that incrementally. So to walk away from growth and let somebody else take some share strategically is probably not a great idea. So usually, when that kind of demand comes along, we're obviously going to ask ourselves the question, is it sustainable? Is it real? And if it proves to us that both of those questions are answered yes, we'll make the investment. And some of the stuff that we're speaking about, Scott, is in Optically Clear Adhesives and the stuff that's getting put into tablets and displays, touch-enabled technologies which are just taking off like rockets. I mean, you've seen the demand reports on some the electronic guys, and we're servicing those people. And you even saw I think in our meeting here, Scott, some of the quite wonderful new technologies that will enable completely clear touch, both side touch, we showed you those kind of gizmos on watches and games that are going to be enabled by this. So we think it's the right thing to do versus some of the other choices we have. And we think, ultimately, it provides us stronger company and a better return for our shareholders.\nScott Davis: I understand. George, can you try ring-fence to that? I mean, are we talking about $200 million, $300 million of additional possibly? Or are we talking more in the range of $1 billion?\nGeorge Buckley: No. We're talking about only -- we work on the basis, Scott, of no surprises. We always think that's better for our investors and actually for our Board of Directors and even for ourselves. We're talking about probably only another maybe $50 million or $100 million on top of what David already outlined to you. That's the kind of the order of the scale we're speaking about.\nScott Davis: Okay. It's pretty material.\nGeorge Buckley: Just easement, not some rapid sort of back of the truck kind of scenarios.\nScott Davis: No. I understand. And just a quick follow-up. I mentioned supply chain improvements just because I haven't heard you talk about it in a while as a driver, and I know you're 5, 6 years into the -- at this point...\nGeorge Buckley: We are. We did everything that we said we were going to do, Scott, and it still hasn't beaned off. I think we've moved up in our regional sources of prior target, maybe 2 or 3 points from sort of the early to the middle 60s. And so there's just huge amount still to be had in terms of benefit to the company. But we are building these plants as fast as we can, and the demand is coming almost even faster. So our ability to catch up while the strategy is right, our ability to catch up is limited. So it's really going very, very well for us. So we don't see this as a failure but rather as a success.\nScott Davis: Yes. If I could, the other point I would add is, what you see this year in 2011 is the first time the company is now having more than 50% of its capital deployed internationally. So as we see the recovery in demand, we are adding capacity and where we are adding it is internationally close to where the growth is. So you're seeing that shift happening as we speak.\nGeorge Buckley: We think this is a good problem, Scott..\nScott Davis: Thank you. Yes, I understand. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Cornell of Barclays Capital.\nRobert Cornell: You guys made these comments about exceeded your own expectations in the quarter and you took the organic growth up x Japan to 7% to 8.5%. Maybe expand on where in fact the quarter did exceed your expectations by business, by geography, whatever.\nDavid Meline: Yes. Okay. What I would say is, first of all, we saw geographically pretty broad-based over-performance to our plan. We saw that happen, I would say, modestly over plan in the emerging markets. As you know, we've got very strong aspirations for emerging market growth. But from me, most encouragingly, we saw good performance in Western Europe in our mature economies, as George mentioned in Japan, before the earthquake hit, and also in the U.S. So geographically, it's quite broad-based. In terms of sector-wise, we continue, obviously, to have very good momentum in the Industrial and Electronics space. They were modestly higher than what we'd expected. And importantly, we saw healthcare for the first quarter after several quarters where they really struggled with growth we saw what perhaps is an inflection point on their growth rate as well.\nRobert Cornell: Maybe it's a little too early to ask, I mean, would you -- I heard a comment about Germany doing especially better. Is it do you think a function of the feet on the street there, the labs in those countries, the product vitality, and at this point, is there anyway to assess which are the various 3M initiatives are driving that strength?\nGeorge Buckley: I don't know that I know the exact answer to that question, Bob. We could certainly find it out and give it to you afterwards, but we're seeing very strong penetration. With the new creativity we've put into automotive, we're seeing strong growth in those areas. Obviously, the things that we're providing for general industrial production is also benefiting the -- there was good growth in dental. It was almost in fact toward the end of the quarter, Bob, also listing telecoms, it really has been right across the board. And David is right, we tend to be optimistic about our ability to create growth. We tend to be more pessimistic about the ability of Western Europe and the United States to create growth. But they were very, very strong this time, and we're hoping that, that means it wasn't a flash in the pan,  but it means we've actually made some -- turned some real corner on those things. So just across the board, Bob.\nRobert Cornell: Thanks. Again, on Japan, though, you guys have put out some numbers here that looks fairly specific given the magnitude of problems there. I mean, how have you've been able to dig down and be this specific you think with regard to the impact both on sales and earnings over the next 3, 6 months, whatever?\nGeorge Buckley: Well, the folks in Japan led the initiatives, Bob. This quite wonderful, sometimes unhelpful, but quite wonderful matrix system that we have here. So they took it from Japan, ran down all of the threads of the various businesses. How they run into different countries, the very supply chain, to kind of knock-on inventory type of analysis that you would imagine. And is the best number that we could come up with. We're not going to bet our pensions on the absolute accuracy of this number, Bob, but you can well imagine we thought it was -- instead of sort of doing some handwaving and giving you some foo-foo dust, we said we want to try our level best to give you a size of it. Make sure -- bigger than a cup and smaller than a bushel basket or maybe smaller than a bushel basket or bigger than a container. So that's what we tried to do. I think, ultimately, the number will be wrong to some degree or another. And I'm hoping that we're being pessimistic in the overall impact that this has.  Because I do think there's some self-correcting influences going on in other businesses around the world, Bob. I mean, both in Japan, nearly all suppliers have -- they don't have a single source of supply. So may have to do some requalification as we've done, but there'll be sort of things that fill the gap. So ultimately, I'm hoping it will turn out to be a bit pessimistic on this, a bit conservative.\nRobert Cornell: Yes, fine. Final question for me. Did you exit the first quarter with the price cost parity, or are you still on the ramp towards price cost parity?\nDavid Meline: Well, as you saw, we exited the quarter with 0.1 positive price, which is the first positive price we've seen for I think 6 quarters. And in March, we were at a half point. So as I said earlier, we were ramping up, which obviously to get to parity for the calendar year, we're going to need to continue to ramp from there, and we see that happening across the businesses and around the world.\nRobert Cornell: Good. Thanks, you guys.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.\nSteven Winoker: So let me just keep this to the 2. The first one is on that 48% gross margin number. And that you mentioned 4% raws up, you mentioned the 1% or 90 basis point impact negative on price to raw. So that to me implies about 310 basis points of positive pricing including optical in the quarter. Am I thinking about that number the right way? And if so, can you talk a little bit on pricing, particularly maybe as it affects some of the units like consumer and office, how are you managing to drive that pricing with regards to that's a separate impact from mix, I take it? And are you seeing consumers trading down? Sort of talk if you could just expand on the pricing dynamic to give us a sense and comfort level that you're going to be able to continue to offset raws during the year.\nDavid Meline: Yes. And I guess as you might guess, we have a variety of situations in terms of the price patterns across our businesses and across the world. Certainly, first of all, what we see is that where we have the most significant cost pressure is in businesses including industrial. And so what they've been doing is they actually went in and in the first quarter implemented price changes. And now as we see continued raw material pressure, we're expecting to have some more in the second quarter. Other businesses, which have a pricing cycle that might be tied to, for example, an annual pricing round such as in areas like consumer and healthcare, we haven't yet seen the full impact of price changes. And that's a process that's going on in a number of cases, either as we speak or going to take place in the future. But generally, 3M enjoys a very strong position as a price leader in many of the markets we participate in, so we typically have very good pricing capability more so than many of our competitors in a particular space, and we don't view this task as being something that we won't be able to accomplish.\nGeorge Buckley: There's another thing behind the scene, Steve. And that is that the higher the rate of new products, the more ability we have to sidestep price. Because prices, any calculations of price, the better pricing on new products is not included. Secondly, you can imagine, we also have behind the scenes very, very strong and powerful relentless operational focus on driving out costs. So the first thing we do when we see this source of price increases coming is what can we substitute, what can we requalify, where can we go with resourcing or substitution. So that takes place. We have yield issues that we constantly are driving at. So using our Six Sigma capabilities and the plants to drive out costs, so it's not only about price. We don't sit back and sort of let the prices come back and just say, can we overcome it with price, because oddly enough, this is a chance to become more competitive. If you can wipe the cost, the underlying cost, you don't need to chase as much price. And in some markets, of course, you can't even get it, but what it ultimately does, it just makes you more competitive. So there's all this kind of activity, a sea of activity behind the scenes, Steve, that helps us chisel awareness.\nSteven Winoker: So maybe as a follow-up. If you can dive into the consumer and office business case of the quarter then, you said that some of the pricing hadn't come through there. I mean but still, we're seeing OI down despite volumes up. And I know there's a lot of dynamics there. Maybe you can just use that as an example in what you're describing.\nGeorge Buckley: Well, I'll get Matt to sort of call you back with the details, Steve. But you've got the cost  tackifiers and polypropylene, which are oil derivative products. Polypropylene is used in most of the sort of the Scotch-Brite and also in our respirators, those sorts of products. Pricing on polypropylene, obviously, is part and parcel of prices on oil. Price of paper, of course, is another issue in consumer and office. And price of plastics more generally of which they sell a lot. So that's what you see, and on top of that, as we said in the notes of the call, we've been investing a lot of money in growing Asia. This is a real big opportunity for us, Steve, for the future. It's going to cost us some money for now, and we see also -- but you got to speculate to accumulate, and we see this massive opportunity in Latin America and Asia, and are pumping more money into those areas. Happy to figure the details later if you want, Steve.\nSteven Winoker: Okay. Thanks.\nGeorge Buckley: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.\nJeffrey Sprague: For David or George, but David in your preamble, you kind of mentioned that classic balance between growth and margin at 3M, and the R&D numbers are obviously directly apparent in the P&L. But wondering if there's anything else that kind of stands out in the margins in the quarter in terms of marketing, other product development actions or things like that. You perhaps took an opportunity in the quarter given what was going on in the top line.\nDavid Meline: Well, if you look at R&D and SG&A, what you would have observed sequentially is that the absolute spend level is roughly comparable to Q4. And what I would infer from that is the fact we said that we had a number of heavy investment programs that we were undertaking in 2010. And those are now in the base. So what you would expect or what you should expect is that we wouldn't see the absolute spend go down. But now we're running with those businesses in our base business, and they're starting to pay off. We're starting to see growth from those incremental investments. They're not fully delivering the kinds of income and margin that we expect, but it's the kind of thing that we have to stay with. So what I would take from it is that the investment plans that we put in place are continuing, and we're starting to see the kinds of initial indications that that's going to support our growth and we can still deliver the margins that we aspire to.\nJeffrey Sprague: And if we could perhaps take that and just drill it into a business, perhaps healthcare, you mentioned that growth is finally showing some signs of life. The margin is back down into the high-20s. Again, using that business as an example, is that where the margins in healthcare need to be to drive satisfactory growth in that business? Are margins actually even want to kind of go lower as you're pushing growth? Obviously, there's some deal impact in there also but...\nDavid Meline: Yes. Well, we've been pretty consistent in indicating that margins in the high-20s for healthcare is the right kind of place for the company to be. That reflects the fact that we are investing in the business for new products and new innovation to grow, and we think that, that can continue. As I mentioned, we saw an inflection in the growth for the first time in some time. Is that the trend? Well, actually, not. It's 1 quarter, right? But we think we're moving in the right direction on that.\nJeffrey Sprague: And just a quick follow-up, if I could. You mentioned the international investment, but given the tight capacity situation overseas which you are, I guess, it's fair to say chasing to some degree, although in a good way, to what extent have [indiscernible] and to what extent are you kind of leveraging weak dollar? And thanks, I'll pass it on.\nGeorge Buckley: Well, I think it's almost opportunistic. We were doing it when there was a strong dollar, Jeff. So we're not ramping it up because of that. And I think ultimately, that will reverse itself. So the strategy to go to the markets that are growing fast regardless of the exchange rate is clearly there. We'll capitalize on some benefit while it washes into our P&L account in the short term, but it won't alter our strategy 1 bit. It's where the growth is. It's where the opportunities lie. Of course, we're hoping, as we were just saying, that healthcare is now back on a little stronger track. We're hoping the United States, perhaps it's beginning to yield to the innovation pressure. And we don't see ourselves -- when you think about all of the currency's that are involved, Jeff, across the world, there's almost a sort of self-leveling, some are gaining on us, some are weakening against us. So I don't think we're doing that or even getting that just because of pricing. I suspect that would be more a case, Jeff, in capital equipment is what I think.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you very much.\nGeorge Buckley: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi.\nDeane Dray: I was hoping to get some more color on the automotive exposure for 3M. Based on our estimate, it's around 11% of total revenues, but it's got a nice split between OE and aftermarket almost evenly. But what are you baking in for production? You called out Japan impact for auto, but this is \u2013 it has other global implications. So what are you baking in over the near term on these production disruptions?\nDavid Meline: What we're assuming is that in Japan, in Q2, that production will be down about 50%. So that obviously impacts us in Japan, and there's also some knock-on effects externally. The data that we refer to most commonly is CSM, if you're familiar with them, as a kind of a leading indicator or economist in the auto space.\nDeane Dray: And what -- in terms of the ripple effect, I mean, there's some level loading going on where other production should benefit, have you factored that in as well?\nDavid Meline: No, we have not. So we don't -- we have the best visibility on the direct impact with the Japanese suppliers, and we have not factored in sort of the secondary effect of potential market share gains, which I think you see on a delayed basis, because if for example, the Americans or the Germans are gaining share, they can draw on their inventories, so you wouldn't expect to see an impact of that until you get out of the second quarter into the third and fourth.\nDeane Dray: Great. And then just last one for me would be related to M&A. And it's clear that 3M has the balance sheet capacity for more transaction. I'm interested in hearing any commentary about the capacity on deal integration. Is there -- could there be any bottlenecks within the organization that have multiple integrations going on simultaneously? And are there any pinch points there? Or do you feel very comfortable with the ability to add more deals over the near term?\nGeorge Buckley: It seems to work out okay, Deane. Obviously, it's a big company, and while we do a lot of acquisitions they're spread right across the company. So it tends to be different people doing the integration. There are maybe here and there some pinch points in finance and IT that you get some of the same people having to deal with these issues, but it does not seem to have been an impediment to us so far, and the biggest acquisition we've ever done, which was the Aearo acquisition has run like absolutely clockwork. So I think we continue to get better at them. I think we continue to be more realistic about forecasting, about pricing, and I think we've done a pretty good job of executing deals recently without too many times overpaying for them. I'm pretty pleased with the way it's going so far, Deane. And we do have a lot of capacity and there's stuff down the pipeline as you can well imagine, but it's all sort of front and central, bolt-ons, stuff in the core or near to the core that you'd expect of 3M, and while we always hope for something more significant, we tend to be pretty balanced in our attitudes toward risk and not wanting to do something that might in some way damage the company.\nDeane Dray: Great. Thank you, and I like the 3 Dog Night reference too.\nGeorge Buckley: Thanks, Deane.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Begleiter: George, in Optical, given the price down and lower attachment rates, can you still grow earnings in this business in 2011?\nGeorge Buckley: My guess is it will be about flat, Dave. I mean, 1 point up, 1 point down, that kind of spread. So I think for now, probably a flat income stream is about the best we can probably hope for. Maybe not the best, but that's probably the most likely we could hope for.\nDavid Begleiter: And would you expect resumed growth next year in this business?\nGeorge Buckley: Well, you always hope for those sorts of things. But it's a constant battle of bringing more for less to the end customer, and some of these end customers are pretty tough. They've got their own set of issues that they're wrestling with. But this has been a remarkable business in many ways, Dave, and you have to give great testament to the creativity of these people who -- when you think about what it's like in a $2 billion business to take a 12% price down year after year after year, 3 years in, that means $400 million coming out of the cost. It's just vast. And I think it's a testament to the capability of the people at 3M. And I really mean this. This is not some sort of slop off thing. These guys have done absolutely marvelous, and I imagine that they will continue to do the same, Dave, and it's where I think ultimately the capability of company like 3M with its scientific capability, it's magnificent world-class manufacturing, will ultimately be the last man standing and many of the smaller competitors that don't have this kind of capability that can only sell on price that they can only sell on low-margin...we'll ultimately, we'll win that battle. I'll bet on 3M.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you very much.\nGeorge Buckley: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR Capital Markets.\nAjay Kejriwal: So on Display and Graphics, good to see the nice performance, and this is without any sizable boost from Optical. Used to be that when Optical sneezed the segment caught a cold. So looks like the other businesses are kind of picking up the slack here. So maybe talk about what you are seeing commercial graphics, what's driving the growth, it looks like very nice double digit in the quarter. So talk about initiatives and what are you seeing in end market spending there?\nGeorge Buckley: Well, you see, it's a number of different things. We're obviously seeing great growth in the core of that business. What we've done, Ajay, is to roll out over the last few years, Bob and his guys have rolled out a range of new products at more attractive pricing but good margins. So we've been able to appeal to a wider swath of the marketplace. We've got some nice little fledgling activities in various parts of that in projectors, in some stuff we're doing for fast food retail, that if it works well, could become an actual blockbuster. But I'm not at liberty to tell you too much about that right now. So there's a lot of great great undercurrent -- groundswell shall we say of initiatives in that business. And of course, let's not sort of -- let's not sidestep the wonderful presence in the market that our Traffic Safety business has. We are the most competent, the most able, the most competitive company in this space. The most innovative, our signs are the best, they last longer. Here and there they maybe cost a little bit more, but we are the kings of this particular castle. And so this is a great segment, although over the years has been buffeted around by Optical. That doesn't mean that the core, the base of this business is not great, and that's what you're seeing.\nAjay Kejriwal: Good. And then just 1 more on your guidance, the 4% to 6% sales contribution from acquisitions, what is the earnings accretion that's implied this year? And then what do you expect for '12?\nDavid Meline: We have small but positive earnings accretion in 2011 in the plan. Generally, from a planning perspective, as a portion of those acquisitions that are in that number have not occurred yet, we assume either those would be neutral or slightly negative within the year. It depends a bit on the timing as to when they occur. But overall, slightly positive. And obviously, in 2012 and beyond, we intend to ramp up those results, which is why we're doing these acquisitions in part.\nAjay Kejriwal: So net-net, maybe flat past acquisitions, and what do you expect to do this year just in terms of the earnings impact and then for next year positive?\nMatt Ginter: Ajay, for 2011, it would be a few cents accretive based on the deals that we have. The important point though, which is the one David brought out, is for the additional 1% to 2% that we haven't yet executed but are sort of in our thinking, depending on the timing of that, could influence that number. So in other words, if those deals happen later in the year and we have purchase accounting that happens later in the year, there could be some impact there. But right now, our thinking is a few cents favorable in '11.\nAjay Kejriwal: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Terry Darling, Goldman Sachs.\nTerry Darling: And, David, I want to thank you for the kind of the bridge on Page 7 on the operating margin walk. I'm wondering if you can talk us through those buckets as it relates to the second quarter year-over-year perspective and kind of how those pieces change. You have talked about price raw materials getting a little bit better. Presumably, you're still assuming that's a little bit net negative. Maybe we start with that one.\nDavid Meline: Yes. So what we expect is in the second quarter that as you have just said, we exited Q1 with better price performance, and we expect that to continue. But I believe that in Q2 we'll still be somewhat negative. Obviously, as we laid out here, the Japan earthquake will become more significant in Q2 on the negative side before the second half basically trending towards 0. The pension OPEB expense is a constant through the year, so you can expect that to be similar. And then, obviously, our organic growth in holding the guidance at 6% to 7.5%, this 8.9% is slightly above what we expect to be the case for the year. And obviously, Q2 will be pulled down a bit by Japan and could be to the extent that we see some inventory correction in the Optical space.\nTerry Darling: Okay. So Dave, the $0.10 or so, I guess, that equates about 120 basis points negative just to your point there, is that about right? Or is there something in the tax calisthenics that make that a little different?\nDavid Meline: Terry, could you repeat the question? It wasn't clear.\nTerry Darling: So on the Japan earthquake impact in the second quarter, you've quantified that from an EPS perspective, and I think $0.10 at the high end. If you just work your way back up, unless there's something funny with the tax calisthenics for just Japan relative to the company total, that would be about 120 basis points impact in the second quarter, is that sound right or is that too strong?\nDavid Meline: We've showed you $0.07 to $0.08 on Japan on Chart 9 in the second quarter.\nTerry Darling: So it's $0.07 to $0.08?\nDavid Meline: Yes. So that would translate -- I don't know the exact number, Terry, but it wouldn't be the 120. It would be something a little less than that.\nTerry Darling: Okay. And then on the organic volume leverage, I mean, the Q1 bridge kind of implies 10% incrementals. Presumably, that's the kind of the dampening effect of the year-over-year strong growth in SG&A and R&D. And so that would moderate in the second quarter to where the base volume incrementals would go higher. Is that fair?\nDavid Meline: Yes. If you that year-over-year Q1, the leverage we got on our growth, it actually ex-factors looks pretty typical of what we expect from organic volume leverage. The ex-factors, of course, are those captured on the page, plus another one, which is on a sequential basis, of course, we had option expense that's more heavily weighted in Q1, and that's going to come off in the subsequent quarters. So that, all other things being equal, you can expect an improvement in our margin just due to the reduction in terms of option expense.\nMatt Ginter: Terry, that number in Q1 is about $60 million higher than it will be in Q2, 3 and 4. They are front loading the Option expense.\nTerry Darling: Okay. So it sounds like wrapping all that up, down year-over-year but less significantly than Q1?\nDavid Meline: Correct.\nTerry Darling: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of John Roberts of Buckingham Research.\nJohn Roberts: Maybe I'll finish with one on LCDs since that's where you didn't want us to focus. The full year '11 guidance previously had been flat to down 5%, I thought. And I thought that first quarter might be one of the tougher, worst comps, but it was actually up mid-single digits there. As we go to the second quarter and third, are we still going down? I guess I'm just trying the trajectory of the year as we progress here through the next couple of quarters.\nDavid Meline: Yes. So the trajectory for the year, what's true is we think that, first of all, at D&G level, the kinds of margins and growth we showed at the total Big B we think is still pretty good guidance for the year. We've got, as we talked about, very good performance in terms of traffic safety. Seasonally, that will get better. C&G, the Consumer and Graphics, is continuing to perform well. So if you look at the whole package, we think that D&G guidance is pretty good for the year. If you look at Optical specifically, yes, Q1 came in well as we recovered off of the very weak performance in Q4. If you look out for the year, what we expect to happen is that in Q2, it wouldn't surprise us if there is an inventory correction in the channel. And then secondly, if you look at the half year, the second half of the year, certainly end market demand is forecast to be improving. But we do foresee the likelihood of some lower level of attach rate for us for TV to the tune of down to 25% attachment rate. So as I said, when you add it all up, we think D&G guidance is quite good, but you might get some level of remixing, both across the quarters and between businesses to get there.\nGeorge Buckley: The flip side of this coin, John, is that tablet demand and pad demand, which you know is just going up like a rocket ship, and we're the suppliers to those folks. So you've got this, kind of, pools and eddies shall we say across that display business in the Optical Systems business where you've got some parts are really just rocket ship strong. Others, which you go in through the typical torture cycle like LCD, where it's every sort of -- it's a micro cent per square light year are -- at issue. And that's why people make switches. So this is a battle that we've fought and lived in, sometimes won, and I don't think we've lost it very often, but we certainly got our nose bloodied once or twice. I don't think this is going to stop. But it's why we pointed out that as we are growing in so many of these other spaces so quite wonderfully with so much innovations across the company, that ultimately less and less and less, over a period of time, this business becomes a smaller piece of our puzzle. And obviously then, it makes it less important to you and more easily manageable for us. But I still think ultimately we will be the last man standing in this business, and this will then mature to a nice steady business with reasonable margins and maybe GDP plus growth rates. That's where I think this ultimately goes in, say, 3 or 4 years time from now.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you.\nGeorge Buckley: Thanks, John.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.\nMatt Ginter: Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us. Had great discussion. Appreciate the questions, and we look forward to talking to you very soon. Bye bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation."}], "2013": [{"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 4, "year": 2012, "date": "2013-01-24 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M fourth quarter earnings conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) It is recommended that you use a landline phone if you are going to register for a question. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded; Thursday, January 24, 2013. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nMatt Ginter: Thank you and good morning, everyone. On today's call, we will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2012 performance along with the 2013 outlook. Inge and David will each make some opening comments and will leave plenty of time for your questions. Recall that during the fourth quarter, we announced a realignment of our major business groups. Segment reporting for the new organization will begin in the first quarter of 2013. Today's results are presented on the basis of our existing segment structure. We will furnish supplemental, historical, business segment, sales and operating income information reflecting the segment realignments in an 8-K and expect to see this filing sometime around mid-March. There'll be mention of few upcoming dates and events. First our 2013 earnings conference calls are set for April 25th, July 25th and October 24th. Also, we will host an Investor Meeting on the afternoon of Tuesday, December 17th. I know that December calendar fill quickly, so please hold these dates and more details will be available later this year. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide two. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Now, please turn to slide number three and I will turn the call over to Inge.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Matt, and good morning everyone. I appreciate you for joining us today. For 3M, 2012 was a year of preparation, progress and performance. We developed and introduced our new vision and strategies and we aligned our organization more closely with our customers and markets. We combined several businesses for increased scale and relevance and we formed new businesses in promising markets. We brought new streams to marketing, sales and e-business and we gave new emphasis and leadership to lean Six Sigma, and we put in place a dedicated team to more efficiently integrate our acquisitions. Today that team is hard at work on both, the FSTech and Ceradyne acquisitions. You will recall from our November meeting that Ceradyne is both, a good business and is strong technology play to build out 3M's ceramic's platform. I am very pleased that in 2012, we brought portfolio prioritization into the forefront of our how we manage the company. This is important for long-term success and we are using the process to improve short-term results as well. In a few minutes, I will discuss several actions we have recently taken. Perhaps the most significant progress we made last year was the strengthening of 3M's commitment to innovation. We expect R&D to approach 6% of sales by 2017 and you will see some evidence of our increased investment in the fourth quarter of 2012. Finally, as you all know, we reset our financial goals for the next five years. We now have targets that are both realistic and aggressive with real possibility of upside. All these actions are evidence of preparation and progress. Let me summarize our 2012 performance. Please turn to slide four. For the year, earnings per share were up 6% to $6.32. Operating income rose to $6.5 billion or 5% increase. We maintain outstanding margins of 21.7% with five out of six business segments delivering above 21%. Sales for the year were nearly $30 billion. In organic local currency terms, sales increased 2.6% with particular strength in Latin America/ Canada, up 11% and the United States up 4% for the year. Asia Pacific was flat for the year in organic local currency, impacted heavily by a soft global consumer electronics industry, and Europe, Middle East, Africa was down 1%. Currency impacts reduced worldwide sales by 2.4% and acquisitions added nearly a point. We returned $3.8 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which was 86% of net income for the year. Finally, return on invested capital for the year was 20%. In summary, a solid year of results during uncertain economic times. The 3M team is well aligned and the company well positioned to win in 2013 and beyond. I will now turn the call over to David for more detail on our fourth quarter 2012 results. David?\nDavid Meline: Thank you, Inge. Let's begin with slide number five where I will breakdown the fourth quarter change in sales. Fourth-quarter sales rose 4.2%, our strongest increase of any quarter in 2012. Organic growth was 4.3% as volumes rose 3.6% and selling price increases were a positive 0.7%. Acquisitions added nearly one point to sales growth in the quarter and foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by one percentage point. On a geographic basis, Latin America/Canada was once again our fastest-growing region with organic local currency growth of 9.7%. This performance was broad-based with all six of our businesses generating positive organic growth in the region including double-digit increases in healthcare, safety, security and protection services, consumer and office and electro and communications. Brazil and Mexico both posted impressive results. Brazil grew 11% organically in the face of a still recovering economy and Mexico grew 10%. Organic local currency growth was 5.8% in Asia Pacific. Japan declined year-on-year reflecting continued tough economic conditions and the rest of APAC rose nearly 10% on an organic basis. For non-Japan Asia, this was the best quarterly growth performance in nearly two years. China was a significant contributor with organic local currency sales growth of over 16%. We also had another very good quarter in the United States with organic sales up 5.2%. Consumer and office led the way with strong double digit performance. In EMEA, or the combined Europe, Middle East and Africa, fourth quarter sales declined 1% on an organic local currency basis. Western Europe was down 0.6% year-on-year. The economies there have stabilized but are not yet growing. Our teams in the region continue to focus on market share gains and productivity. Let's now review the income statement. Please turn to slide number six. Sales for the quarter were $7.4 billion, an increase of 4.2% in dollar terms. We generated $3.4 billion in gross profit and maintained strong gross margins of 46% for the quarter. SG&A spending rose 1% and we have increased R&D investments by 10% versus the fourth quarter of last year. Operating income increased 5.8% in Q4. Operating margins were 19.5%, up 30 basis points year-on-year. Four primary factors contributed to the margin change. First, as I mentioned earlier, we grew organic volumes by 3.6% in the fourth quarter, which we leveraged into approximately 50 basis points of higher operating margin. Second, the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices added 1.4 percentage points to fourth quarter margins. Selling prices increased 0.7% year-on-year, largely due to carry over price benefits from actions taken earlier in 2012. Raw material raw material cost deflation was approximately 3.5%. Third, acquisitions in total reduced operating margins by 50 basis points. As Inge mentioned, we are in the process of integrating two recently closed deals Ceradyne and Federal Signal Technologies. Both integration efforts are going well with no major surprises, and from a financial perspective, we are right where we expected to be at this point in time. Adjusting for these deals, operating margins would have been 20% in the fourth quarter. Finally, we experienced lower factory utilization in Q4 versus the same quarter of 2011, which combined with the other factors hurt fourth quarter operating margins by 1.1 percentage points. All things considered, we delivered full year operating margins of 21.7%, right near the midpoint of the 21.5% to 22% range we were expecting. Fourth quarter earnings per share increased 4.4% to $1.41. Average diluted shares outstanding declined 1% year-on-year, which added [$0.01] to EPS. The fourth quarter tax rate was 28.7%, up two percentage points year-on-year which reduced earnings by $0.04 per share. The fourth quarter concludes another year for 3M, and with our plan in place and our organization aligned, we anticipate a strong 2013. Let's now review our fourth quarter performance on business by business basis. Please go to slide number seven. Sales in the Industrial and Transportation business were $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 4% on an organic local currency basis. We achieved good growth in a number of businesses, including industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives, automotive OEM and personal care products. We posted double-digit increases in two businesses, specifically liquid filtration and aerospace and aircraft maintenance, where we continue to win business and penetrate further into these important markets. Our Renewable Energy business declined 12% on an organic local currency basis. On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales in Industrial and Transportation increased 6% in Latin America, Canada and the United States, and 4% in Asia-Pacific. Industrial and Transpiration's fourth quarter organic sales were flat in EMEA. Operating income was $469 million and margins were 18.8%. Adjusting for Ceradyne, Industrial's operating margins were similar to fourth quarter 2011 levels. Now, let's move to Healthcare. Fourth quarter sales increased nearly 6% on an organic local currency basis to $1.3 billion. Healthcare generated $430 million in operating income in the quarter, up 11% year-on-year and operating margins were 32.3%. Continuing the trend from recent quarters, the growth in Healthcare was very broad-based. All businesses posted positive organic local currency sales growth in Q4, led by food safety, health information systems, skin and wound care and oral care. On an organic local currency basis, sales increased in all major geographic regions with double-digit increases in Latin America, Canada and Asia-Pacific. In developing markets, Healthcare drove nearly 15% organic local currency sales growth continuing our recent success in these areas and we expect the momentum to continue. In developed markets, our healthcare team continues to generate solid profitable growth despite ongoing government austerity efforts in many major countries. In summary, a superb quarter for healthcare. Now, let's look at the Consumer and Office business. Sales were $1.1 billion this quarter, up 9% on an organic local currency basis and operating income rose 29% to $230 million. In the United States, sales increased at a double-digit rate in the fourth quarter. Holiday sell-through was good and we saw some holiday related sales shift from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. This shift boosted our Q4 growth rate by an estimated 1.5 percentage points, year-on-year. We continued to benefit in the U.S. from a strong flow of new products in consumer and office, such as our recently introduced line of Command Clear wall hooks. We are also gaining excellent traction in safety products for the retail channel, most notably in protective eyewear under the 3M TEKK brand. Finally, Filtrete brand filters grew well in Q4, boosted by colder weather patterns in many parts of the country. Elsewhere in consumer and office, we also drove double-digit organic local currency growth in Latin America/Canada and low single-digit growth in both Asia Pacific and EMEA. On a worldwide business basis, our strongest growers were consumer health care and DIY with positive growth also in home care products and stationery and office supplies. All in all, this was a strong quarter for our consumer and office team. Let's take a look at our display and graphics segment. Sales in the fourth quarter were $910 million, an increase of 8.3%. Optical systems had a good fourth quarter, with sales up double digits and stable profit margins year-on-year. Optical finished the year largely as we had expected. We also posted positive organic local currency sales growth in architectural markets, traffic safety systems and commercial graphics. Display and graphics grew 12% organically in Asia Pacific, 10% in Latin America/Canada and 5% in the U.S., EMEA sales were down 2% year-on-year. Operating profits in display and graphics were $152 million, with operating margins of 16.7%. Margins declined 2.5 percentage points year-on-year, primarily due to the FSTech acquisition along with start up cost in a couple of businesses. Let's examine safety, security and protection services business. Fourth quarter sales were $904 million, down 2% on an organic local currency basis. We posted good growth in most businesses with notable strength in infrastructure protection and personal safety products. Sales declined in our security systems division as the market remained soft and the business has been under strategic review. Inge will address the actions we are taking to better position security systems for success going forward. On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales rose 13% in Latin America/Canada, and 1% in Asia Pacific and declined 7% in the U.S. and 5% in EMEA. Operating income in safety, security and protection services decreased 5% year-on-year to $162 million and margins were 18%. Margins declined 50 basis points impacted by the aforementioned challenges in security systems. Finally, let's review electro and communications. Sales in this business totaled $776 million in the fourth quarter, up 1.8% in organic local currency terms. Operating income total $142 million, down 6.5% year-on-year and margins were 18.4%. On an organic local currency basis, sales increased in touch systems, electrical markets and telecom. Sales declined a bit in consumer electronics and we are anticipating first quarter will be similar. In geographic terms, Latin America/Canada rose 10%, the U.S. increased 4% and Asia Pacific rose 1%, while EMEA declined 3% in the quarter. That concludes my discussion of the business segment results. Let's move on to cash flow. So please turn to slide number seven. From a cash flow perspective, fourth quarter was quite similar to the same quarter in 2011. Free cash flow was $1.23 billion, up $10 million year-on-year. We invested $507 million capital expenditures during the fourth quarter down $10 million versus fourth quarter of last year. Full year CapEx was $1.5 billion, which was in line with our expectations entering the year. Free cash flow conversion was 124% in the quarter versus 128% in last year's comparable quarter. For the full year 2012, free cash flow conversion was 86%. We returned over $1.1 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter including $714 million in growth share repurchases and $407 million in cash dividends. For the full year 2012, we returned $3.8 billion to shareholders or 86% of net income. So that concludes our review of the fourth quarter. Now I will turn the call back over to Inge.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, David. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to spend a few minutes on 2013, and how we are working to strengthen 3M. I said earlier that 2012 was a year of preparation, progress and performance. With a planning behind us 2013 is a year of putting our plan into action and truly competing to win. To win, we are strengthening our portfolio, and at the same time, working to resolve some challenging business issues. For example, in November, we announced a combination of our security systems division with our traffic safety systems division. In recent times, these businesses have not performed to the standards we expect and we are addressing these issues head-on. Government spending for security has decreased over the last few years and those same factors have also affected our traffic safety systems' business. In a big picture bringing these two businesses together creates an opportunity to optimize the overall business and increase efficiency. We announced last week a restructuring in these businesses that will result in the reduction on 300 positions worldwide and we will take related Q1 charge of $8 million. In a company of our size and breadth there would always be some businesses under strategic review, and while the specific solutions may defer the underlying principle is the same. They will not stay under strategic review for long. We will take action. And in context, these situations are few when compared to 3M's overall portfolio of outstanding businesses. For 2013, we will continue to drive our strategies, invest in innovation, commercialize new product as quickly as possible and work to take market share everywhere. We have confidence in our plan and our people and in the planning estimates we gave you in December, which you can see on slide 10. We expect 2013 earnings per share in the range of $6.70 to $6.95. We look for organic local-currency sales growth of plus 2% to plus 5%. The tax rate is expected to be 29.5% to 30%. And finally, we anticipate free cash flow conversion of 90% to 100%. As for the near-term, we are naturally a bit more cautious. There remains a degree of uncertainty as we see some economies growing and others are slower to recover. The same dynamics can be found in specific markets. Healthcare is doing well for example, while consumer electronics just have to recover fully. Specific to the first quarter, we anticipate approximately $30 million of restructuring and one-time acquisition cost. This includes the $8 million in restructuring cost I mentioned earlier. The point is, we will execute our plan to keep improving and growing the business. Thanks for your attention. We will now take your questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning.\nInge Thulin: Morning.\nDavid Begleiter: Inge, just in Industrial, sequentially, the business sales declined $73 million, but operating profit declined $106 million, sequentially. Can you just describe exactly what drove that dynamic Q3 versus Q4 in Industrial?\nInge Thulin: Yes, I think we have some businesses that do well and continues to do well there, like automotive did well. I think one of the impacts is the RED business that we had an issue with and have had during the whole year. The way we look upon RED is that is relatively small division for us, generally speaking, it is a $400 million business and you can look upon the segment, it has two segments, one conservation and one generation. Conservation is like the window films for us, that was type of flat. On generation side, which is wind and solar, as you know, on the global market that is a declining market. So we were down in that side. So I think that was a big piece for us during the quarter for the industrial in total.\nDavid Meline: If I could, David, as we look at industrial performance in the quarter, the sales were quite reasonable in terms of 4% growth year-on-year. Certainly, Q4, we always see a decline in activity including margins. As you know, as we called out, we were also impacted by the cost in Ceradyne.\nDavid Begleiter: Very good, and just, Inge, on consumer electronics, you mentioned it would be like weak through Q1. Any further insight in to when it might pick up via your customer's order book or?\nInge Thulin: No, I think 2013 will look like the beginning of 2012. It will look like the same. So we don\u2019t know of the ways it will be coming but probably sometime in the end of Q2 is the indication that we can see at this point in time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you, good morning everyone. Inge, back in November, you gave us some good insight to your thinking around business under strategic review. I just wondered if there is not anything else moving around? I think, at the time, you said there was about $2.5 billion of sales that were, maybe, in the crosshairs. Could you just give us some color on how big security and transportation is, now that you have put together, as a percent of that? And if there is any other businesses moving around in that thought process?\nInge Thulin: First of all, as I said, we are taking action related to that. As I said, that\u2019s about fixed combined or closed in order to see the advantage of the businesses and if we can fix them moving forward. So I think this is a first good step for us. We believe by combining those two divisions that there is very good synergy for us in between the two businesses. Just to make a comment around it, both those businesses that are based on material as the core. So we are very strong in both those businesses in the core relative to material. Then both businesses are type of reaching out and go into more solutions around electronic. So that is the advantage of combining them in order to look upon the synergy. So when we look upon it specifically, you have elements of the customer facing opportunity, which I think is still very precise in terms of execution and then you can get leverage around technology, business processes, compliance and then manufacturing and supply chain. So when you do that, combine them, you will get more efficiency and also from an organization perspective around the world where we have all the subsidiaries. It will work very well for them because they get more focused, more dedication and can execute better. In many pieces there, as you know, is project management. So you need to have a specialist that is working with us. So combined those two businesses, we feel very good in terms of, this is something we can fix, it is something where we will win and we will move them forward. Some other businesses, without calling them out, we are working on that in order to solutions for them as an outcome around the strategic review. So this was two of them that we looked upon in order to make sure that we can win for the future. I will update you as we go and the actions will be taken.\nJeffrey Sprague: And these two combined, would be the biggest single piece of businesses under review now?\nDavid Meline: So, if you look at the businesses under review, we have called out as part of that the security division was in there and that was a business, $400 million to $500 million of revenue out of that $2.5 billion. Traffic safety was not part of that group but inevitably as you look at how to get the right alignment across the businesses in our total portfolio, we made that change\nJeffrey Sprague: Inge, can you, or David, provide a little more color on what you are seeing in China, the organic growth in the quarter, any particular end markets that are standing out, and I guess everybody's question really is, is there a legitimate recovery of some sort now underway there as opposed to kind of the hopes for one that everybody had last year.\nInge Thulin: Well, we saw recovery. And as you saw, we had growth in the quarter of 16% in total. Our base business, which is excluding electronic was like 10%, so that's a good uptick for us. And, I would say then and that's a quarter for us last year, right? 2012. Looking into the 2013, our base business, I would say will continue in the same mode as we saw then. We don't know yet in terms of electronics. So, electronic maybe will still be a little bit of a challenge as we move into the year, but for the base business we see recovery coming and we feel optimistic about that, but we're still cautious as you said, because when you look upon quarter-by-quarter, it's not the old China if you like, right? That's a different base line that we need to grow out from, but we can see recovery coming in base business and it's a big portion for us, so we sequential improvement in that as we move ahead for the base business going into Q1. Electronic is little more a question mark for us as we speak.\nDavid Meline: Yes, if I could add. So, base being industrial, we saw a good growth again in healthcare in the quarter and China as we've seen all year. And also recall, or you may recall that we had a very weak quarter in China last year in the fourth quarter, so quite honestly there's a bit of an element here of the year-over-year comparison.\nInge Thulin: I think five of six businesses grew in China in the last quarter\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nInge Thulin: Morning.\nDeane Dray: On Healthcare, those are stellar margins above 32%, and typically when we start seeing the margins bump up that high, there's some cautious comments about sustainability that you may be making some investments in this business, but how would you frame for us in terms of that level of profitability and the outlook over the near-term?\nDavid Meline: Sure, Deane. So, as I commented in the speech, we are encouraged of course by the fact that we see broad-based growth across all of the divisions in healthcare again now in Q4. We did see a little bit of a pull forward in sales into Q4, in part due to those activities that will be impacted by the medical device tax. So, you saw it tick up a little bit in terms of growth and we know about a half a point of that growth was associated with that pull forward. In terms of margins, we continue to believe now that in 2013, we do expect the margins to run at 30-plus percent for the time being, but looking at this one, obviously, we had everything came together at the same time in that quarter and so I wouldn't suggest you that that you would bank us continuing to operate every quarter at that level.\nDeane Dray: That's fair. Then a broader macro question, I think a lot of folks in the industrial side were braced for some anxiety in December related to the fiscal cliff and certainly didn't see it in your organic revenue growth at 5.2%, but could you provide any color in terms of customer behavior? Was there any hold off or push out in orders other than that healthcare getting pulled in, but broadly anything that you think may have been delayed that may then snapback in January?\nDavid Meline: No. I would say, Deane, we saw sale, if you look through the quarter, the trends during the quarter were quite stable. We didn't see any particular effects that we could point to other than the one I just mentioned in healthcare. Obviously, the other piece of course, we were very pleased with was a holiday performance for consumer, but beyond that were there other notable ups or downs or inflection points? I would say, we didn't see any and therefore as we look at our guidance into 2013 by sector, we think that the growth ranges that we called out in December still looked good in terms of what we expect in 2013.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Good morning, guys. One question, just in terms of the overall margin walk, you had this utilization and other bucket. The volumes were up nicely and accelerated. What is going on the utilization? Did you actually choose to take your production a little bit down to get rid of inventories or is there anything else going on in that?\nDavid Meline: So if you look at the margin walk, we did have about a point there related to utilization. It was really a couple of things that are the biggest pieces of that. One of them is, we included in there some cost related to startups of some new factories that were restarting up. So we have got in particular, if you look in Singapore we have in the traffic signage business, we have a new factory that started up here in the fourth quarter. So that impacted our utilization, because there are costs as you ramp up the business. There also was also a new project we have got in the electronics space in touch panels that impacted utilization in a similar way. Then we also had, if you look at our utilization year-over-year, in a couple of areas we did see a lower level of activity. Those being in some of the consumer electronics related spaces. So, if you look at utilization in the semiconductor space, amongst our customers that was lower in Q4 and that impacted our business. As well as, Inge was referring to RED, or the renewable energy business, we saw some lower utilization at some of those factories. So that was really what drove that impact.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Okay, and then just looking specifically at the display and graphics margins. You had a few factors in there. You had FSTech, you had some of the startup costs there. Then traffic safety has also probably had down margins right. So can you just give a little color on the buckets of those and how much they contributed to the margin?\nDavid Meline: Sure. So if you look at it, we had a year-over-year decline D&G of about 2.5 points. As I mentioned, not related to divisions such as optical where we had very stable performance in terms of margin and very much what we expected. The two biggest factors there, as I did mention, about almost half of it was the impact of the FSTech acquisition and the other piece was more related to the startup cost which I mentioned that impacted the company overall. We had a little bit of product mix but I would say a third of the factors that you line them in terms of significance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Winoker: Thanks and good morning. Just first question on your pricing. So you had the pricing spread 140 on back of two quarters at 160, which is great performance but how much of that is or how do you think about that relative to commodities, giving you any kind of tailwind there and your ability to price on the commodity discussion and your ability to price going forward? How much is a function of that versus new product intro and what's giving you the pricing power across your businesses and what's your ability to maintain that given how critical that\u2019s been to the margin performance quarter-on-quarter.\nDavid Meline: Sure. So you got the figures. We tried to lay those out quite clearly. She trend, as you know, is why we did have 0.7% price performance in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s primarily the impact of price increases that were taken earlier in the year. With the situation on raw materials, as I have said in November, we expect the pricing impact in 2013 to moderate further. As to our ability to hold price and avoid commoditization, of course, as you know the business model is exactly geared towards offering innovative solutions that differentiate our products for our customers and provide value that they are willing to pay for. So no difference in that model next year versus any time in the past. In terms of raw materials, we do expect the tailwind of raw material price declines that we experienced in 2012 to substantially moderate. That's why we said in our guidance for 2013 that we think that that impact will pretty neutral. So, we do feel? We think it will be less of a contributor the combination in 2013 than we experienced in 2012, but also not the kind headwind we have the prior couple of years and we feel good about our ability to deliver on that.\nSteven Winoker: In the pricing part of that though, you think that 70 basis point. I mean, as you look forward, you think you can maintain that kind of pricing alone?\nDavid Meline: In our plan for 2013, we do not expect to see price increases for the year as high as that 0.7.\nSteven Winoker: Okay. Then what kind of inventory restocking impacts or destocking did you see across the portfolio over the last quarter and do you see that, has that been trending differently?\nDavid Meline: Yes. We don't, other than a couple of specific areas that we've tried to talk about today in specific businesses, the general trend we've seen we would say, if you look at the sales trend pretty stable for the company through the quarter. And I would say, we did not observe anything notable in terms of unusual inventory patterns.\nSteven Winoker: Okay. And just one more in the guidance, you've got 2% to 5%, you just did 4% on organic growth. So, you know, presumably certainly a sequential move the other way. Is that fair or how are you thinking about that?\nDavid Meline: Well, yes. I mean, the overall guidance 2% to 5% for the company in 2013 we still think is the right way to think about it. If you look at the Q4 performance in terms of sales, which obviously we were quite pleased with moving from 2% on average during the first nine months up to 4%, if you sort parse that out about half of it was related to the performance in the consumer segment, which as I think we have talked about or we've inferred, we think that that was related to some fairly specific factors in Q4 and we continue to think 2% to 5% growth for consumer in 2013 is the right way to think about that segment. Then the other contributors most significant one to that pickup in Q4 was the performance in Asia, most significantly the base business in China. And, as Inge said, we've taken some reasons for some optimism that we are seeing a recovery as I think others are talking about are we getting I would were cautious to start running away with that is something that's going to continue to trend more strongly. But, again, we are encouraged by the indications.\nInge Thulin: I think, first of all you know we stick to our guidance we gave you in December. We're, of course, pleased with outcome of Q4 in terms of our growth, we are as cautious as we move into the year here and operate in the same way that we moved into 2012 very successfully.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nAjay Kejriwal: Thank you. Good morning. Could you maybe provide any color on how the quarter progressed? Obviously, very good organic growth quarter. Did you see any pickup in December?  Then maybe any early read into what you are seeing in Jan? Have the trends that you saw in the fourth quarter, have they continued? Have you seen any pickup? Any thoughts there would be helpful.\nDavid Meline: Sure, Ajay. Yes. I would say, again, and not repeat but if you look at the selling rates more on a daily basis, we didn't see anything changing in Q4. Now, there were some issues around how many selling days there were as between October, November, December, so you know you get some different outcomes if you looked at that on a monthly basis because December actually had a lesser number of days than last year. But as we look at it on the on a very granular basis, we didn\u2019t observe any trends that were implying some new level of inflection in our overall business in total and again, obviously, some pluses and minuses which we have tried to call out here today. If I then roll forward into where we are sitting today in late January, we see relative stability in terms of the overall business. Again, I don\u2019t see anything that I would point to that would indicate some new information for us here.\nAjay Kejriwal: Good, and then on the consumer business, I know there were a couple of things that helped the quarter but even ex-that, it looks like you had really good topline. So does that change how you are thinking about the business, how that business does this year. Your guidance I $2 billion to $5 billion for that segment. Based on just the performance, do you think you could be conservative? Any thoughts there?\nInge Thulin: First of all, we are very pleased with the performance from consumer. It is probably the business during this year that really put a very good plan together were able to execute it to very successfully. And as David laid out, there was some specifics in Q4 that boost the growth for us. But however it was a very good growth in both businesses and in all geographic areas. As you recall while we eventually can see a little bit of uptick as we go further out is our relatively low penetration in international. So we will keep the guidance for now. What we can say very clearly that we are making headwinds both in international and in United States and have both very good growth in United States, as David called out in our Q4 in a highly penetrated market. Then we have still a lot of opportunities in international. The thing that what is happening is that business have improved the consumer insights and they have added their sign as big elements of the business on top of the innovation that we can provide for the company to them then their very strong category management capabilities that we have in that business. So you look upon consumer, for us, long-term is a very, very good business for us with good upside and both that business and healthcare, as you know, for us is what we call very much local domestic businesses that we were able to grow and both of them have still big opportunities in international. So we are very encouraged as we move ahead but we are not changing the guidance in terms of growth as we speak here today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, good morning. I think most of my issues have been addressed but just quickly, you scaled the size of the security systems business but traffic systems have got my model at $0.9 billion. Is that about right?\nDavid Meline: Yes, it's just under $1 billion business.\nNigel Coe: Then just couple of quick ones. Since you gave 2013 guidance the Yen has been under bit of a tear, does that change in anyway? You have got a quite a big exposure to Japan. It is about 8% of your sales, I believe. So does that change anything in terms of FX impact or perhaps margin?\nInge Thulin: No, it's not sufficiently material to us right now, Nigel that we would feel that we need to call out a change. Obviously, we are monitoring because the Yen has weakened already and there is obviously a lot of talk about a further weakening. If you recall, we hedge about 50% of all of our exposures. So that gives us certainly the ability to navigate and adjust the business if we see something more structural happening, but not material right now that we would need to talk about.\nDavid Meline: Nigel, I would add too, it's 8% of sales, but we do have a 25% minority partner in Japan. So a quarter of the profits belong to the minority. So from a sensitivity standpoint, the move in the Yen is going to be less pronounced than it would be with the likes of the Euro.\nNigel Coe: Okay, good, and then staying on FX, there is some linkage between U.S. dollar movements and pricing, particularly in regions like LatAm. Has the stronger dollar over the last couple of quarters had any impact, albeit at the margin, on pricing in those regions?\nDavid Meline: Well, in some of our contracts we do price pegged to the dollar. So in fact to the extent that the currency has weakened we saw, in local currency terms prices increased and likewise you would see some reductions in pricing which would be reflected in the overall 0.7 that we mentioned.\nNigel Coe: Okay, great and then just finally, we finally saw a renewal of the R&D tax credit. You got a pretty big R&D investment. Does that change at all your tax view for 2013? I know you maintained the line at 29% to 30%, but does that maybe put it down by some tax rate in 2013?\nDavid Meline: Yes. What I would say is first of all we came in for the year at 29%, which is right in the range of 29% to 29.5% that we had indicated for 2012. It is true that if I look at there is a modest effect for us of the carryover impact of the deferral of these extenders into 2013. But as we look at the number of different factors that impacts the tax rate during the year, lead us to include at this time that we think that 29.5% to 30% outlook for the company is a good. And quite honestly, the information I have in front of me, I don't see any reason why quarter-to-quarter that that rate is going to be vastly differed from the full year rate guidance I have got out there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Tusa: You mentioned a couple of the moving parts on the first quarter. I think the normal seasonality is up, but no double-digit 10% to 15%, but you mentioned I guess $30 million of incremental restructuring are there any other moving parts into the first quarter or should we just expect kind of normal seasonality here on an earnings basis?\nDavid Meline: Yes. I would say what we see right now is pretty normal seasonality, Steve. The one area that we are cautious about, which Inge mentioned is in the Electronics space. We do see some ups and downs there and we think that we may have some lower level of demand in some of those sectors for example, as I mentioned semiconductor, utilization has been running a bit lower. I think that will impact us in Q1. But overall, we think it's fairly normal.\nSteve Tusa: So, like low 160s kind of numbers? If that's just a 10% to 15% increase from the fourth quarter, just the math?\nDavid Meline: Yes. We don't do guidance on a quarterly basis. We'll probably keep that at least for the time being.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Then one last question, just on the inventory dynamics, I mean, I guess looking back there, your portfolio is kind of like electronics, healthcare and then some industrial businesses. Just looking back over the past year, did you think you have seen an impact from inventory dynamics outside of electronics mostly in the industrial businesses and maybe you noticed in the postmortem of the last year-and-half of the volatile economy? Is there any way to kind of quantify how much that might have been if you had any, or is it even material?\nDavid Meline: I would say, yes. Good questions, Steve, and in the past we spent a fair amount of time talking about inventory dynamics and the effect on sales. If you look at the sales through the year, pretty stable. Obviously, the low end of what we were looking for as the economy was basically downgraded through the year. If I look at our growth performance overall as compared to the overall industrial economy, it was a little bit towards the low end of that range and I could infer from that that there was probably either neutral or some level of destocking through the year that might have affected us.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. So, no material destocking that would lead to any significant benefits on auto restock? I mean, clearly looking at some of the more OEM component guys like Kondamal or something like that sales down 15%. You guys didn't really see that?\nDavid Meline: Not anything dramatic like that no.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin: Yes. Just a couple of clean-up questions. In terms of this 1 percentage point drag, and you sort of seem to have indicated that most of it comes from, a lot of it comes from the start up costs. Should we expect those to moderate throughout the year?\nDavid Meline: Yes. I think that's fair to assume. Well, we will always have start ups. We had certainly record levels of capital investment here in 2012. As we told you, we expect our CapEx to rise in '13, and while I would say as there is ups and downs in terms of both the startup cost, so we happen to have some startups in the fourth quarter, sometimes coincidence with both the lower production requirements in seasonally in the fourth quarter. Sometimes it will take advantage of a holiday shutdown to plan around those startups. So, if I looked quarter-by-quarter, quite honestly I haven't done the deep analysis, it may be true that you see seasonally a bit more startup costs in the fourth quarter, but throughout the year we will have that type of activity certainly.\nAndrew Obin: But the drag should be the highest in Q4 than Q3?\nDavid Meline: I think that's a fair way to think about it. Yes.\nAndrew Obin: And other question I have just an observation, if I look at the organic growth, it's the best since Q1 2011 and if I look at the pricing, interestingly enough it's been on a downward slope and it's now probably the weakest since Q1 of 2011. How should I think about dialing up pricing up and down to drive the organic growth? Is there a linear function here?\nDavid Meline: I would say, not on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So I think the facts we are staring at here in Q4 are a perfect example of that, which is there is not a short-term and direct correlation, i.e. we have taken up quite a significant amount of pricing earlier in the year. The decline in that is more of a function of the fact that we had a lot of earlier price adjustments which now mathematically result in the lowest price increase in Q4. If you look at the sales growth as we have talked about some specific factors around what's going on with some improvement in the base business in China as well as the consumer business. So it's a good observation. I wouldn't draw a direct cause and effect in the short-term from that.\nAndrew Obin: So, I should be thinking that NPVI strategy continues to be successful and you can get both in theory, topline and pricing long-term?\nDavid Meline: We believe that's true, yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Walker: Good morning, this is Rob Walker for Laurence. Can you provide an update on your supply chain initiative?\nInge Thulin: Yes, we continue to build that out. As you recall, we started out maybe four, five years ago. One thing that is important is for us to build what we call those super hubs where we are coming closer to the markets and the customers around the world due to the fact that, that is where we see the big growth. So, it's an ongoing process. I don't think we will ever be ready with it because even when we will be ready the market is stagnating at that point in time. But we make very, very good progress and even now in last quarter, we started a new investment in Turkey, where we are building out a good hub for both Central East Europe and Middle East Africa. So, we will be the bridge in terms of our initiatives for that part of the world from a supply chain perspective. We have also a big initiative going on in Europe but we try to consolidate our supply chain in West Europe specifically in order to be more efficient and coordinate that in a better way. So it's an ongoing process. We are making very good progress in the process there. But there's still more to do and as I said, I think it is one of those that you will never be ready.\nRobert Walker: Thanks and then, what are the prospects for market share gains this year across your portfolio?\nDavid Meline: Well, our plan is aggressive in terms of what we need to do in order to take market share and specifically in developed economy. As you know, there is not much growth in the market. So we have very aggressive market share plans in that part of the world. So you should look upon it like a 50-50 base. So what we say is you need to take 50% of your growth from market share and 50% based on penetration. And I think in most businesses, we still have a good upside relative to market share. The other thing you have to think about our business model is that we are working in different categories, right. So we have a type of consumables that is going into health care and the consumer market and some consumables that is going into manufacturing product that is used in order to help to improve productivity and efficiency. That\u2019s one piece of it. The other piece is, where we are expecting on big platforms. So, the point is for us is growth in total. In some businesses, we can go, write it down and calculate the market share. Other thing, we create new solutions on platforms that is running for long time. But if you go in to specific on consumables, in both consumer healthcare and the industrial, we have aggressive market share plans and we still believe we can deliver on that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Fleck of Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Fleck: Hi, good morning. Thanks for staying on guys. I appreciate it.\nDavid Meline: Morning.\nAdam Fleck: Quick question on inventory. Your company inventory came down sequentially, of course, that's typical for the fourth quarter but it finished a little higher than we've seen in previous years. Are you comfortable at this level here or how do you think about that?\nInge Thulin: Yes. So, I would say, as you exactly observed, we typically have seasonally here, Adam, decline in inventory in Q4. If we look at our turnover metrics, they look very comparable to other years, other fourth quarter-type performance areas. We did mention that we do expect here in the near-term to have some specific areas, where we might have some further reduction in activity in the first quarter, specifically in some of the consumer electronics area, but overall I would not say there is anything fundamentally different going on.\nAdam Fleck: Okay. Great. Thanks. That's helpful. Then shifting to Europe, kind of a bigger picture question. You mentioned that you are seeing a bottom, but the region isn't really growing out in Western Europe, and of course you are forecasting, I think a negative 3% to a positive 1% growth for this year. How do the development that you've seen that bottoming, how does that fit into your expectation? Is that kind of right in line with it or is it on the top or bottom of that?\nInge Thulin: Yes. I'm not sure exactly if I'll answer your question as you're trying to pose it, but if we look at Europe right now, we've had a couple of years now or about a-year-and-half, where we printed negative growth performance. It has moderated obviously. And as you pointed out, we are calling out a range that centers on minus 1 next year. So, everything we can see, we are running pretty stable there, there's some ups and downs as between north and south. But overall when you look at the portfolio pretty stable, and what we've really been focusing on with the business is to make sure that we are as competitive as we can be as a company in Western Europe, so we're looking at how we can take advantage of opportunities to leverage our business across the entire region. We are looking at areas of growth, because inevitably there are opportunities to grow in the region. And so, in areas like healthcare, we've seen some growth opportunities and then we are also looking at how we can optimize and make sure we are making a reasonable return, so we were pleased this year that we did see our margins improve despite weaker sales performance.\nAdam Fleck: Okay, great. That's it for me. Thanks.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.\nMatt Ginter: I would like to thank everybody for spending the hour. Appreciate your questions, appreciate your attention and your ongoing support of 3M, so we will talk real soon. Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 3, "year": 2012, "date": "2012-10-23 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, October 23, 2012. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nMatt Ginter: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Third Quarter Business Review. With me today are Inge Thulin, 3M Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Meline, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me mention 3 upcoming investor events. First, as a reminder, we're hosting an investor meeting here in the Twin Cities on Thursday, November 8. If you plan to attend and have not yet responded, please RSVP right away. Second, on December 12, from 8:30 to 10:00 a.m. Central Time, we will host a conference call and webcast specifically addressing our 2013 financial outlook. Look for an invitation shortly. And third, our next Earnings Conference Call will take place on Thursday, January 24, of 2013. One more item of note, we recently announced a realignment of our major business groups to better serve our global markets and customers. As we described in our October 3 press release, segment reporting for the new organization will begin in the first quarter of 2013. And lastly, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 2. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. So with that, I will turn things over to Inge. And please turn to Slide #3.\nInge G. Thulin: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. For us, the third quarter repeated a pattern we have seen throughout the year: solid earnings, strong margins and steady organic sales growth delivered against challenging macroeconomic conditions. Once again, 3M's operational excellence was an important factor in our quarter. Our Q3 GAAP earnings per share were $1.65, up 8.6% year-on-year. Operating margins were again strong at 22.4%. All 6 business segments delivered margins above 21%, a sign of continued broad-based effectiveness and efficiency. Sales in the quarter were $7.5 billion, basically flat when compared with last year. Currency was again a factor, a drag of 3.1%. Organic local currency growth was up 2.2%, with increases in all of our segments, including Display and Graphics and Electro and Communications. Geographically, the Americas were again strong, including double-digit organic local currency growth in Latin America, the 11th consecutive quarter that we have achieved that level. The United States rose 2%; Europe, Middle East, Africa was up 1%; and APAC remained flat. We returned about $0.75 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases. So all in all, Q3 was another quarter marked by steady organic growth, operating discipline, efficiency and investment to improve our business. One example of investment is the acquisition of Ceradyne, which we announced October 1. This is an excellent match on many levels: the advanced ceramics technology platform, the global possibilities and, in combination with 3M's technology arsenal, the ability to bring new solutions to numerous industries such as automotive, oil and gas, industrial and electronics, just to name a few. Now David will take you through the detail of the quarter. David?\nDavid W. Meline: Thank you, Inge. Let's turn to Slide #4 for a discussion of the third quarter income statement. We continue to operate well in the quarter with excellent factory efficiency and discretionary cost control, both of which were necessary given the continued soft economy. Sales for the quarter were $7.5 billion, down 0.4 percentage points year-on-year, including over 3 percentage points of currency headwinds. I will elaborate on the change in sales in just a moment. Gross profit dollars increased by 1.7 percentage points year-on-year. SG&A spending declined by 3% while R&D investment spending rose nearly 2%. Total operating income increased 6.1% and operating margins were again strong at 22.4%, an increase of 1.4 percentage points versus last year's third quarter. The combination of raw material cost reductions and selling price increases contributed 1.6 percentage points to operating margins in the third quarter, while year-on-year increases in pension and OPEB expense reduced margins by 0.3%. Third quarter earnings were $1.65 per diluted share, an increase of 8.6%. Average shares outstanding declined 1.7% year-on-year, which boosted earnings by $0.03 per share. The third quarter tax rate was 28.2%, down 40 basis points year-on-year, which increased earnings by $0.01 a share. During the quarter, we incurred various restructuring charges totaling $0.01 per share, and insurance recoveries added $0.02 to earnings. As I mentioned before, operating margins improved by 1.4 percentage points to 22.4%, reflecting continued strong operational excellence across all of our businesses. Please turn to Slide 5 for a more detailed look at our third quarter sales change. Third quarter organic local currency growth was 2.2%, with equal contributions from both volumes and selling price increases. Acquisitions added 50 basis points to sales growth in the quarter. Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 3.1 percentage points as the U.S. dollar remained strong versus the euro and a number of other currencies. Again, on a total dollar basis, sales declined 40 basis points versus last year's third quarter. Looking across geographic regions. Latin America/Canada led the way with strong organic local currency growth of 10.5% in the quarter. All 6 of our businesses contributed to this growth, with particular strength in Safety, Security and Protection Services, Electro and Communications and Display and Graphics. Health Care also posted double-digit organic local currency growth within the region. On a country basis, Mexico in particular had another strong quarter, with 19% organic local currency growth. Our teams there have done a fantastic job building the business, with focused investments in a number of key areas. Those investments are paying off nicely. In the United States, organic sales rose 2.3%, marking the 12th consecutive quarter of positive growth in the U.S. In EMEA or the combined Europe, Middle East and Africa, third quarter sales increased 0.8% on an organic local currency basis. We saw nice double-digit increases in the Middle East and Africa, along with positive growth in Central Eastern Europe. West Europe was down 1% in the quarter, an improvement versus the first half of the year and reflecting the economic growth challenges in that region. Our West European teams remain focused on taking market share and driving productivity. I was encouraged to see that operating margins in the total EMEA region increased year-on-year by nearly 2 percentage points. So our teams there are executing extremely well in the face of challenging macro conditions. Across Asia Pacific, organic local currency sales were flat in the third quarter. Growth was strongest in our Health Care and Consumer and Office businesses. Our businesses serving the consumer electronics industry continue to improve, but by no means have we seen a full recovery. Focusing on the China-Hong Kong region. Organic local currency sales were flat in the third quarter. We saw positive growth in Health Care and Consumer and Office, both domestic-oriented businesses, and in Industrial and Transportation. This growth was offset by year-over-year declines in Renewable Energy and personal safety. Longer term, China remains a key growth engine for the future, and we will continue to invest. We regard any challenges there as temporary. Let's now review our third quarter performance on a business-by-business basis. Please go to Slide #6. In the Industrial and Transportation business, sales rose 3% on an organic local currency basis to $2.6 billion. Automotive OEM led the way this quarter with 11% organic local currency growth. We also achieved good growth in aerospace, automotive aftermarket, 3M Purification and Industrial Adhesives and Tapes. On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales increased 8% in the United States, 5% in Latin America/Canada and 1% in EMEA. Asia Pacific sales were flat in organic local currency terms. This is our largest business by a wide margin so we were encouraged to see such broad-based growth with excellent profitability. Operating income was $575 million, up 9% over last year's third quarter, and margins improved by 2 percentage points to 22.4%. Now let's move to Health Care. Third quarter sales increased 4% on an organic local currency basis to $1.3 billion. Operating income grew 9% to $400 million, with strong operating margins of nearly 32%. We saw strength across the Health Care business, with the strongest organic local currency growth in food safety, health information systems and skin and wound care. Drug delivery was down low single digits in Q3. Geographically, sales expanded in all regions and especially in Latin America and Asia Pacific where we have increased our investment levels over time. Now let's look at the Consumer and Office business. Sales were $1.1 billion this quarter, up 1% on an organic local currency basis, and operating income was flat year-on-year at $244 million. Operating margins were 21.9% in the third quarter. Our strongest growers in Consumer and Office were DIY, consumer health care and home care, while stationery and office supplies saw modest declines on an organic local currency basis. Acquisitions added 2.5% to sales due entirely to GPI Group, a leading French producer of home improvement products. We purchased GPI on October 1 of last year, so next quarter, it will become part of our organic sales base. On a geographic basis, organic local currency growth was 7% in Latin America/Canada, 6% in Asia Pacific and flat in the U.S., while EMEA declined 3%. One item of note, during the quarter, in light of objections from the Department of Justice, 3M and Avery Dennison terminated the agreement under which 3M would have purchased Avery's Office and Consumer Products business. Let's take a look at our Display and Graphics segment. Organic local currency growth rose 1% in the quarter to $936 million. We were encouraged that sales increased $54 million or 6% on a sequential basis. Third quarter organic local currency sales rose in architectural markets, commercial graphics and traffic safety systems. Sales of optical films declined just slightly year-on-year but rose 15% sequentially. On an organic local currency basis, sales grew by 16% in Latin America/Canada and 3% in the United States but declined 1% in both EMEA and Asia Pacific. Operating profits in Display and Graphics were $199 million, up a strong 11% year-on-year, and margins were 21.2% for the quarter. Let's examine the Safety, Security and Protection Services business. Third quarter sales were $926 million, up 1% on an organic local currency basis. Growth was led by the infrastructure protection and personal safety businesses. This growth was largely offset by declines in roofing granules and security systems. On a geographic basis, sales rose 20% in Latin America/Canada and 2% in EMEA but declined 6% in the U.S. and 4% in Asia Pacific. Operating income in this business was $196 million, down 3% year-on-year, and margins were 21.1%. Finally, let's review Electro and Communications. Third quarter sales in this business were $820 million, up 0.1% in organic local currency terms. Operating income increased 3% to $186 million, and margins were 22.7%. Organic local currency sales increased in Electrical Markets and declined year-on-year in both telecom and consumer electronics-related businesses. On the electronics side, a number of industry product launches were delayed, contributing to lower-than-expected growth in our business. Overall, the industry is showing signs of recovery but at a much slower pace than expected earlier in the year. In geographic terms, Latin America/Canada rose 17%, the U.S. increased 4% and EMEA rose 1% while Asia Pacific declined 4% in the quarter. Both Electro and Communications and Display and Graphics posted positive organic local currency sales growth in the third quarter, the first after multiple quarters of decline. We expect similar momentum in the fourth quarter helped by favorable year-on-year comparisons. That concludes my discussion of the business segment results. Please turn to Slide #7. Free cash flow for the quarter was $987 million, down $39 million year-on-year. This amount includes $246 million in pension and OPEB contributions, which was similar to the last year's third quarter. Year-to-date contributions totaled $918 million and we expect approximately $1 billion for the full year. Capital expenditures were $358 million, up $22 million versus third quarter of last year, and we expect to invest approximately $1.5 billion for 2012 in total. Free cash flow conversion was 85% in the quarter versus 94% in last year's third quarter. We returned $735 million to shareholders in the third quarter, including $408 million in cash dividends and $327 million in gross share repurchases. So that concludes my discussion of our third quarter financial results. Now Inge will address our forward outlook, beginning on Slide #8.\nInge G. Thulin: Thank you, David. Earlier this year, we shared 3M's vision followed quickly by our strategies. Consistent with our strategy to build relevance and presence in the marketplace, we recently announced a realignment of our major business groups to better serve both global markets and customers. As Matt said, we will begin reporting results under the new structure in the first quarter of 2013. Very simply, we moved from 6 businesses to 5 business groups: Consumer; Industrial; Health Care; and 2 newly formed business groups, Electronics & Energy and Safety & Graphics. The realignment is a natural outcome of our strategy to increase relevance to our customers and to broaden our presence in the markets we serve. By building scale more broadly across the company, it creates critical mass in each business group to take better advantage of innovation and commercialization opportunities. The Electronics & Energy business groups illustrate this concept very well. We will bring together all of our capabilities in these markets to increase our impact and relevance with big, global OEM customers. At the same time, we enhance our ability to leverage key manufacturing and marketing assets. I'm personally very encouraged by early feedback from multiple customers who look forward to strengthen our partnership for mutual success. Please turn to Slide 9. In the short term, however, we still face the challenge of sluggish economies in large developed regions like Western Europe and Japan. As David said, the teams there are working to take share and drive productivity, and I am very pleased with our progress. In China, the year clearly has not played out the way most anticipated. But as we have said many times, short-term challenges will not divert us from the future opportunity, so we will continue to invest and build our business and our capabilities locally for the long term. Our China for China approach is the right approach as the Chinese economy evolves away from its dependence on exports and towards domestic consumer-oriented businesses. Of course, China is not the only location where we are investing to improve our business and strengthen trend [ph] innovation. In Q3, we announced plans to build a new state-of-the-art laboratory facility at our headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota. The new laboratory, scheduled to open in early 2015, will house some 700 scientists who currently work in other facilities here. With the latest in equipment, it will be an environment designed specifically for the development of innovative technologies and an important hub in 3M's global research network. Let me now turn to the outlook. Please turn to Slide 10. With one quarter left in the year and no indications that condition in the fourth quarter will be dramatically different from the third, we are adjusting the full year earnings outlook to a range of $6.27 to $6.35 per share. This range includes $0.03 per share of anticipated acquisition-related expenses, largely Ceradyne. On organic local currency growth, we now expect a range of 2% to 2.5%. We look for a currency penalty of approximately 2.5%, a little lower than it has been running. And we look for margins in the range of 21.5% to 22%. In summary, Q3 market conditions were challenging and we expect this through the end of the year. We will continue to expand our business, drive productivity and execute our plan with strong discipline. Thank you for the attention. We will now take your questions and comments.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford and Bernstein (sic) [Sanford Bernstein].\nSteven E. Winoker: All right, can we just maybe start with pricing and inventory trends? On the pricing side, you got an -- healthy 1.1% again, which is great, and more value versus raw materials. But this is also down, I guess, on the pricing side from last quarter year-on-year. Maybe just talk about the trend and the sustainability, what your expectations are both into next quarter and as you see going forward. What's the ability of the organization to continue to get pricing in the near term?\nDavid W. Meline: Right, Steve. So if you think about pricing in terms of what we've talked about this year, we indicated in the last call that we thought we would have about a 1% price performance for the calendar year. As we look now at Q3 and into Q4, I think it's going to be 1% plus, so maybe a little bit above that level. If I look more specifically at -- as we trend to the end of the year, I think we'll have positive price performance in Q4 but it'll be a little bit less than what we saw in Q3, and it's very consistent with the plan that we had in place which is where we took quite significant price adjustments here late last year and earlier this year. And in the current environment, we don't see -- both on the negative side, we're not seeing significant concerted price pressure on the business. So we're able to be in more of a holding pattern on the context of weaker raw materials. I would say the one exception there, which is probably no surprise, is we're seeing typical price dynamics in our electronics business, specifically in Optical Systems where we'll probably see double-digit price declines on the year, which is pretty typical and how we plan the business.\nSteven E. Winoker: Okay, that's helpful. And on the inventory -- oh, sorry. Go ahead, Inge.\nInge G. Thulin: Yes, this is Inge. I'll make a comment on inventory. Now as we are 3 quarters into the year and we -- and all of our customers went into a year which we knew will be uncertain, I think everyone have really focused on the inventories and the turns, both ourself and our customers. So as we said on the last call, it's managed very well so we don't see it as an issue, by definition. I think the inventories, generally speaking, are very well in line with demand. I think we saw a little bit of uptick relative to TV sets, whereas, as you maybe recall, last quarter we said it was 7 weeks. It's slightly higher but not much. But I think that's the only thing we have seen. And then I will see -- in the retail side, they also manage it very tight. So when we look upon back to school this year, it was okay. It was not great, but that's indicating for us that -- they are managing the channel very well. So as we see today, broad-based everywhere, it looked like, maybe due to the fact that everyone went into this year with a view of uncertainty, is -- managed it very, very tightly. So we have not seen a change from last quarter, by definition.\nSteven E. Winoker: Okay. And Inge, could you maybe comment? On the segment realignment, we haven't heard much in the way of cost repositioning as a result of the realignment. What is your view on the implication on the cost side?\nInge G. Thulin: Well, this was done in order to serve the customers better and make sure that we can accelerate growth. So I think that's the starting point, to make sure that is the prime objective. So all focus here was to make sure we get more aligned with our customers and the market; create, I would say, speed in between what we call customer-inspired innovation right back to our laboratories and back out again so we can commercialize faster. So I think that's the prime thing for us to be able to do, and that is where we focus. Now by definition, we should see, which is build into our overall aggressive model, some productivity improvement. But I hope that we should be able to reinvest that in order to get the growth rate up a little bit higher than we see today. So I will say that there will be an efficiency in the organization, hopefully with less internal meeting, more external meeting but use the resources in order to make sure we're aligned with customers so we can get these things going. And I -- as I said in my opening, I received multiple, very positive response from very big, global OEMs that really can see this as a benefit for them and us in the way we work. So that's how I will look upon it. And as you know, we are driving our model constantly in terms of improved productivity and efficiency. So the prime objective here was to be offensive and make sure we align better with the customers and the markets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR Capital Markets.\nAjay Kejriwal: So maybe just continuing on that pricing question, sounds like it's still -- will be positive in 4Q. Could you maybe comment on raws? So it looks like that the pricing raw spread was a nice positive 3Q. How should we be thinking about that spread into the fourth quarter?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes, right, Ajay. So if you look at raw material costs, you're right, we did see actually what we expect to be the best year-over-year comparison here in Q3 for the year, which was over a 2% decline in raw material costs. And right now, what I'm looking for, for the full year is around 2%, including continued positive performance in Q4. Although, we're starting to get into a period now, by Q4, where some of the trends in raw material price declines were already starting to be apparent last year. So we're starting to get into a year-over-year comp issue, but nonetheless we think that we'll continue to see good performance on that side.\nAjay Kejriwal: Got it. So then on your margin guide, the low end kind of implies 4Q margins would be flattish year-on-year. And you've being seeing nice improvement last couple of quarters. It sounds like you will continue to manage cost and pricing raw material will be a positive. So how should we think about that low end? Is that just being conservative, or is there any of the segments that we should be thinking about?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes, good question. So if you look at the balance of the year and the guidance, basically, I think it would be fair to say you would align the low-end revenue guidance with the low-end margin. We don't see any particular notable change in terms of the trends of the business sectors, other than the fact that seasonally we always have slower sales in the fourth quarter, and lower margins. But no particular trend to note, other than the fact that we have seen what we believe will be the bottom in the electronics cycle, as we've been calling for through line [ph] and frankly through the last 5 quarters. And so we will see some continued positive trend on the electronics space, although that's frankly more of a comps issue right now than necessarily seeing the kind of strength that we had originally foreseen in that recovery.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.\nCharles  Stephen Tusa: Sorry, just to go back to the price cost question, can you just -- the -- that bridge is very helpful in showing what impact is on margins. So I -- we can kind of put it together, doing the math, but I guess, just to get to the point: So the fourth quarter will be around what? It was 1.6 points this quarter. What do you guys expect for the fourth quarter?\nDavid W. Meline: We think that the trend on price cost will continue in a similar fashion. So raw material cost trend, we don't see any inflection point further up or down as we move into the fourth quarter. And as I described, from a pricing perspective, we get into a tougher year-over-year comp as we had very strong price performance last year in the fourth quarter. So when you look at that price performance, we think it will be positive in the fourth quarter but less than what we saw in the third.\nCharles  Stephen Tusa: Okay, that's helpful. And then on the -- I guess, just digging into the segments a little more. As -- the safety and security business had a pretty dramatic step-down in the margin. There may have been something in the second quarter I'm forgetting about. But was that a mix issue? Is that something that -- did the weakness kind of come at the end of the quarter there that kind of caught you off guard and, I guess, similarly for Consumer and Office. I mean, this business has been running at such a hot rate but the margin down year-over-year. Just on those 2 segments, what's going on with the margins and what would you expect in the fourth quarter?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes. So if you look at -- well, first of all, Steve, as I just mentioned to Ajay, I wouldn't see -- other than normal seasonal factors, I would foresee that trends in all of the segments, including those 2, would be pretty similar in Q4 to Q3. If you go specifically first to safety and security business, what we saw this year was a couple of things happening: So first of all, if you look at the margin, 21% in the third quarter, which was very steady on a year-over-year basis. What's also true is that, if you look at, in particular, our OH&ES business, our personal safety business, it was up in the mid-single-digit range, which is quite good but it is slower than what we saw in the first half. So part of what you've seen is a general slowdown in the macroeconomy that did impact the personal safety business overall even though it's still printing mid-single-digit growth. The second thing sequentially which I think is important is we saw a pull-forward in demand in the roofing granule business, which was driven by the fact that we had very mild weather here in the U.S. in the springtime. And so there was a pull-forward, which really supported the first half, including the margin there. You saw a very unusually high margin than in the second quarter. And so now what's happening is demand in that segment is correcting that -- an exception to Inge's general comments on inventory, we are seeing an inventory reduction there, and that's coming through in the results here in the third quarter.\nCharles  Stephen Tusa: Okay. And then just lastly, I guess you guys had some discretionary cost takeout from last quarter. Any discretionary cost takeout in the second half here, in the third quarter?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes, so in terms of restructuring, we've done now $80 million year-to-date, including about $0.01 a share, around $10 million here in the third quarter, which is again normal in our business in particular in a time like this. We've been working hard to look where there's opportunities to improve our efficiency and competitiveness so we did a little bit more here in Q3.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi.\nDeane M. Dray: For the $0.02 insurance recovery, is -- did that show up in SG&A? Was there anything else in SG&A that have brought that a little bit lower?\nDavid W. Meline: Actually, that shows up in other expense line and so not in SG&A. SG&A really is a story around managing the business in a fairly tepid growth environment. So same kind of expense patterns that we've seen through the year. I think, importantly for us, what we're really trying to do in that area is make sure we're prioritizing to invest in that area, in the key growth areas. So if you look at some of the emerging market segments we've talked about before such as health care in emerging markets, we continue to add a structure and resources in that area around the world. And at the same time, we're looking as to how we can be most efficient, including in places like Western Europe where our overall margin year-on-year was up over 2 points, and that's -- not an insignificant piece of that is related to how we're really driving efficiency.\nDeane M. Dray: So that would be the -- should we use a run rate of third quarter for our fourth quarter estimates for SG&A?\nDavid W. Meline: For SG&A? Yes. In terms of absolute terms, I would say yes. Obviously, there's a seasonal factor that's always impacting us in Q4.\nDeane M. Dray: Okay. And then last one for me is on the acquisition of Ceradyne. Inge, I'd be interested in hearing the dynamics on how you can leverage all these different technologies of ceramics. You rattled off a number of them, auto and oil and industrial. But you've got a decline in body armor sales. That's been well known within Ceradyne, but if -- it looks like 3M would have an opportunity to really leverage some of the other material science opportunity. So can you just expand on that and maybe a time frame where we would start to see some penetration there?\nInge G. Thulin: Yes. First of all, we are still in the process, as you know, in terms of completion here so some of the comments I will make here will be more generic. But if you look upon it from a technology perspective and when you add the -- what we have in term of chemistry and solutions coming to shapes, what will be added here is minerals and powders, meaning that we will have a much broader base in order to develop relevant solutions in the marketplace and so, I think, you look upon it from many platforms and many businesses. In fact, today, what we have in ceramics ourselves, it's around USD 3 billion in sales where there's touching, right? So touching, what, 18 divisions. And we've been able to build that out in many, many places. So we hope now to complete it here during this year. And then we would start the integration very fast, and we have an integration team in place. And then we hope we'd be able to talk more to you around specifics as we close it down and we'd be very excited to do it. What is really interesting for us here and different from the many other acquisitions we have done, this is broad-based for many businesses for us and it's a technology play where I think the combination of what we have today and what Ceradyne is adding to us from a technology perspective will be really, really powerful. So you're right in terms of your comments on short-term cycles in the business, but we look beyond that and believe we really can leverage these big time as we move ahead. So we believe this is a very good acquisition for us strategically long term but also with short-term revenue benefit added into next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nAndrew Obin: I just want to clarify something. One of your comments, you talked about broad macro. So as you go into the fourth quarter, are things getting worse globally, or they just remained sluggish but stable? Just to understand what the macro framework is here.\nInge G. Thulin: I think we will say stable as we go into the fourth quarter. We don't see any uptick, but we believe it's stable. So that's also the way we have looked upon the estimation for the rest of the year. So it's -- there's many uncertainties in the market, as we all know, but we all manage it well and have done so, so far this year. But we don't -- we see it stable for the rest of the year. We don't see any upticks, by definition. We will continue to drive our operational excellence in West Europe, that we have done successfully this year. And as David said, we are very pleased with the team there in terms of how they are able both to take share but drive productivity and improve margins. And as you saw, United States is moderating a little bit in growth for us, but again, we show local currency growth. And some of this businesses here, like industrial, had an effect, an 8% growth in United States in the quarter, which is very encouraging and very good. And then I -- when you look upon emerging market and so forth, I think one thing is, for the whole electronics part of the business, the recovery is slower than expected by the industry. So this is not 3M. This is slowed and expected by the industry, and sequentially, we improved. So I think that's good for us, as you saw both Display and Graphics and Electro and Communication show positive organic growth this quarter. So it's slower but it's improving.\nAndrew Obin: Could we just dig into a little bit more in China just couple of things? Could you talk more about some trends between industrial versus consumer trends? When do you guys -- what are you hearing on the ground about if and when growth will accelerate?\nInge G. Thulin: Yes. Well, first of all, I think the way we look upon that, this is to say, first of all, our strategy that we have now executed for many years, that is around China for China, is now proven to really be the right one. China's economy has historically been very dependent on export. And I will not categorize it that they are moving from export to domestic. I would say export will continue to be important, but the, what I would call, domestic and consumable part of the China economy will be more important as we move ahead. That is why we are very well positioned. And we have invested now for many years in Health Care, that is coming back -- growing very, very well for us now, and the same in Consumer. So we have made investments here during the last 5 years or so in order to be prepared for this. In terms of the Industrial side, in fact, for us, if we take out the renewable business, in the quarter, the Industrial business grew by 9% plus in China. So we think it will come back here in terms of growth. And I think it's very much dependent on the uptick in West Europe for exports going over there and the United States.\nAndrew Obin: And do you have any expectations of -- baked into your guidance as to when the Chinese decide to accelerate their economy? Or is it just steady as she goes?\nDavid W. Meline: The way we built the guidance for the balance of the year, Andrew, is really steady into the fourth quarter. That would be in China as well as across the business generally.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.\nJeffrey T. Sprague: Just a high-level question first and then maybe to follow up. Inge, just back to the reorg, can you give us a little more color on how it actually makes you better? And what I mean by that, when I think of customer intimacy, I think of smaller divisions and smaller P&Ls, not consolidating from 6 to 5. And I know there's a lot of businesses underneath the surface at 3M and it sounds like that's not changing. But it's unclear to me how the reorg actually makes you competitively better.\nInge G. Thulin: Yes. First of all, it -- as you see that a couple of businesses become -- more sizable, meaning that it will be easier for them to prioritize inside the businesses. So I think that's an advantage relative to making choices as we move ahead. And as you know, I'm a big believer in prioritization so I think that help you. The other thing is it will now become easier for us to utilize our capabilities both for manufacturing and research and development in direct to our customers. So if you think about Electronics & Energy, that's big markets and big customers. A total market space for us would be very, very sizable. And what we would be able to do here is to line up our resources, which will help us in terms of the speed for commercialization, which is again based on customer-inspired innovations. So I think that linkage is very important to us. So by definition, size and scale is important. And that we'll have some other alignment relative to smaller divisions below that, that will happen. But very much, when you think about the divisions that we have had maybe in 2 different business segments before, doing business with big, global OEMs is slowing us down relative to our interaction, response, et cetera. So I think that really will help us as we move ahead. And as I said earlier, I've got many positive comments relative to the improvement in alignment that this will help us with.\nJeffrey T. Sprague: That's helpful. And then just near-term trends, Inge, we heard a lot of companies suggest that July and August were just kind of basically in line with what they thought, and then they didn't get the normal seasonal bounce in September or September orders were disappointing. Do you see that anywhere in your business? How did you actually exit the quarter? And any early read as you look into October here?\nInge G. Thulin: Yes. Well, when we looked upon billing per day, in fact, during the quarter we had a slight increase as the quarter went on. So I think that what you're referring to, what other people are saying to you, I'm not sure that's correct for us. David will comment here as well. But what we saw was that the invoicing per day, per billing day, had a slight increase as we went through the quarter. So that was a positive thing for us.\nDavid W. Meline: Yes, I would just add. So in the context of our prior view of the year, obviously we brought down our revenue growth for the year to a lower range. So I think the way to think about it, as we do, is we had steady sales through the quarter. Obviously, September was a shorter month, so some people may be interpreting the overall sales impacted by the -- the less billing days. But our expectation had been actually a stronger rise specifically in the electronics segment, which didn't materialize, hence steady sales through the quarter, not rising as much as we'd foreseen and in one particular sector. And therefore, we've adjusted our outlook for the year accordingly.\nJeffrey T. Sprague: Great. And then just finally, David, one quick one for you, if you could. If you'd just kind of snap the line today on pension, can you give us a sense of what the -- what the headwind would look like next year?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes. If we were to look right now, and obviously we'll have a lot more detail in December in the call, and I also will talk in some depth in the November meeting, as we're going to look at the long term. But if I look at pension right now, despite the fact that we would expect to see a flat or modest decline in the discount rate next year, basically we've been amortizing deferred losses over time and that amortization is now declining. So we have a declining amortization of prior discount rate changes, we have quite good return on asset performance, I think, this year through September, in the U.S., it was somewhere over 10%. And therefore, I'm presently expecting that our pension expense next year will certainly not be a headwind and there's -- the more likely scenario is we'll get some modest tailwind next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.\nNigel Coe: So David, if I can just follow up on that last point there. Is the reason for the amortization falling is because you amortized the 5 years, is that correct?\nDavid W. Meline: We have a 3-year amortization buildup and then we amortized the balance through over a 10-year period after that. So if you think about the trends, which is we've taken quite substantial reductions in the discount rate over the last couple of years, that's now being fully built into that schedule. And likewise, we've seen, as I mentioned, good return-on-asset characteristics as well, which gets amortized, so to the extent we perform better than assumptions, that likewise gets amortized. And so we're building out actually better layers of positive asset performance. So the combination of those 2 would lead to the outcome that I mentioned.\nNigel Coe: Okay, that's really helpful. And then just switching back to inventories. You're heading to 4Q with a bit of an -- a Q-o-Q increase in your inventories. I'm sure some of that is due to the weaker dollar. But are you planning to take any unusual reductions in inventory as we head into 4Q? And I know we normally do see entries coming down into 4Q, but anything unusual there?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes, I would say not unusual. And yes, it wouldn't be surprising to see us bring down some inventory in the fourth quarter, which is typical of the seasonal pattern.\nNigel Coe: And does that have any measurable impact on margins in 4Q?\nDavid W. Meline: Certainly, lower production levels have an unfavorable impact on margins, as is typically true. I mean, if you look at prior years, I think that would give you some guidance how to think about it.\nNigel Coe: Okay. And then just finally, you've got some debt maturities coming up over the next 12 months. Obviously, it's a favorable time to go out and refinance debt. Any thoughts on maybe topping up the debt balance and taking advantage of the low interest rates environment?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes, so we've been looking at -- we would agree, we've got a $500 million maturity here in the fourth quarter. As we looked out at the situation, we decided that it was a good time to do some prefunding. So we went in here and in June, July time frame and did a $1.25 billion issuance, which was intended to, in anticipation of both the rollovers as well as the fact that we viewed the market situation, to be quite favorable at the time. So yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura.\nShannon O'Callaghan: So just when you think about operating income, it was up 6% in the quarter and really came from the price raws this quarter. Pension was a headwind, FX was a little headwind. So those sound like they'll get more favorable, and you just mentioned about pension. But price of raws is a big number. So can we sustain kind of the 6% op income growth if volumes stay soft? Is there another sort of driver to keep that going or maybe any other dynamics?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes. So I think -- I guess my answer, Shannon, is that, as we look at running the business -- certainly as we came into this year, we were quite cautious in terms of the growth opportunities. And therefore, we postured ourselves to -- well, we had talked about a 1% year-over-year margin improvement in the company, which we're certainly on track to deliver for the year. As I look out forward, frankly, we haven't finalized the 2013 plan, if that's what you're referring to, but certainly we'll have to look at what's going on with growth in the economy, we think we'll be able to continue to grow our business at and above that trend based on the investments that we've been doing. And certainly, efficiency is part of the model that we'll need to make sure that we're balancing with also investing in the business. So we feel good about the business right now. We think the sustainability is very good in terms of our overall performance. And obviously, we'll have to be able to adjust to the extent we see movements up or down in the economy.\nShannon O'Callaghan: And would you -- and would you go out and get more price? Or would there be restructuring savings? Or what -- I guess, what would replace the current kind of price of raws lever?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes, I mean, I would say we have to look at all of those factors in order to drive the business. But I -- bottom line, we think the equation is very sustainable. We have a number of levers that we can pull on. And we'll have to look at all of those pieces as we roll this out here for next year.\nShannon O'Callaghan: And I just -- a little follow-up on electronics. So I mean you guys have been a little more encouraged coming out of 2Q, on a pickup in electronics. And now it didn't come through. Can you just give a little more color on sort of what you saw that had encouraged you and then what the setback was from that?\nInge G. Thulin: Yes. First of all, the -- what happened in the marketplace was that there was a weakness in semiconductor and hard disk drives, so the outlook has weakened from Q2 for both those segments. So I think that was a clear change in the outlook, as we had it back in Q2. So for us, electronic-related businesses was down nearly 3%, with optical down 40 basis points. But optical was up almost 16% sequentially, with a profit of up 20% year-on-year and 40% sequentially. So that was interesting move for us and very good. So very profitable, and they did well. I think that we see a modest recovery in Q4. And what we see also is improvement in handheld and smartphone market where we have good penetration. So that's working in our favor. So I think that's what you have to see if you look upon weaknesses, it was semiconductor and hard disk drives and that's no surprise for you and -- or for us once we have seen what's happened in the market. And then we see improvement in handheld and smartphones, which is based on all solutions working in our favor. So...\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Feldman of UBS.\nJason Feldman: Latin America and Canada, as a region seemed to have been particularly strong now for quite some time. It looks like it's beyond just end market growth but also including penetration. When you look at that, is it really just because you're coming from a lower base there? Or are there lessons or models kind of from that region that you can apply elsewhere?\nInge G. Thulin: Well, first of all, I -- when you look upon Latin America, we have a broad-based, very good performance. And as David said earlier, specifically, Mexico at this point in time is doing very well and that's due to that they have built out a very strong platform that we have had for many years in terms of our commercialization capabilities but now built out with more local manufacturing and with more research and development. So as you saw in the quarter here, it was 19% organic local currency growth, which was very good. Brazil is a big subsidiary for us and also doing very well. And again, the success there is that we have invested since many, many years. We have been in Brazil since 1946 so we have made investment not only for commercialization capabilities but manufacturing and research and development. Now the good thing in Latin America, it's all other countries are also doing very well and our portfolio is very balanced, generally speaking, in Latin America. So we are not so heavy in one of the bigger businesses, it's broad-based, with Health Care strong, Consumer and Office have a very good position with very good brand equity that they are leveraging. So I think it's -- the thing here for them is that they have gone very early on the localization strategy, and that's playing out very, very well for us. So good base, continue to grow and we are very happy with the performance there. It's also -- the team, I would say, when you go down to execution, that have this fantastic balance of both entrepreneurial in terms of finding new businesses but also driving operational excellence, very, very effective there.\nDavid W. Meline: Maybe I'll just add one point, which is, if you look at Latin America and building on that theme, it's our most mature of those emerging market investment areas and you can see how well the model works. Over time, we're applying exactly that same model in places like Southeast Asia, like Central and Eastern Europe, like Middle East and Africa. And we think that, that portends well for the future.\nJason Feldman: Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly, we're beginning to see kind of an increase in prevalence of touchscreens for monitors for traditional PCs in advance of Windows 8. Is that an opportunity for the optical films business? And when do you expect that to actually -- wind up being big enough to make a difference itself [ph]?\nInge G. Thulin: Well, I will position it slightly different. I would say that is an opportunity, broad-based, for 3M technologies. I will not hold that to optical film. That's one of the reason why we have realigned the organization, with an Electronics & Energy business. So coming back to the question before, what is the advantage? We have so many technologies that are going into the electronic industry and going into, specifically, handheld, that this will be the advantage. So the answer is yes. Please broaden out in terms of many other products and solution that we will provide. On the timing, we are working very close with our customers. And we cannot talk about that at this point in time in terms of when they will introduce the platforms. But the answer is yes, this is a good thing for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies & Company.\nLucy Watson: This is Lucy Watson, on for Laurence. On -- for your current order of visibility, I guess, how is your visibility on order trends in the industrial and auto markets in particular? And are any of your customers alluding to plans for longer year-end shutdowns this year?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes, so I guess I'll just pick up on some of the earlier comments. If I look at specifically the auto OEM business, we saw double-digit growth again this quarter, which is roughly twice the rate of the build, so what we're -- it's quite clear to us that we're seeing very good market share pickup in that space, and we're pleased with that. What we also believe to be true is that, in the fourth quarter, we will see a decline in the sales in that space, which is consistent with what's going on with schedules, which is we do see the fourth quarter schedules for automotive build globally is down, I think -- as I recall, it's about a 3% year-over-year increase. So we see that coming down. Do we have specific additional insight beyond that? Quite honestly, frankly, as I stand here, I don't. So -- and then industrial, generally, the trends we have seen -- I mean, there's been -- if you look at the numbers, you see some softening in the industrial momentum, which is very consistent with what's going on in the macroeconomy. As Inge commented, as we look through the third quarter, on a daily sales basis, we were encouraged frankly to see that the sales were pretty steady. And to be honest, we're watching very carefully: We've taken a more conservative posture in terms of the outlook for growth for the full year. That reflects a more conservative view of the fourth quarter because we think there's a -- plenty of uncertainties out there. So while we've been encouraged with our ongoing performance, we're also, frankly, trying to be appropriately cautious right now.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.\nMatt Ginter: Well, thanks for joining us today. I know it's a very busy earnings day. Appreciate your time and attention, appreciate your continued interest in the 3M Company. We look forward to seeing you in November, those of you that are coming. And we'll talk real soon. Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to Ceradyne's Second Quarter 2012 Conference Call. This conference is being recorded today, July 24, 2012, at the request of Ceradyne. [Operator Instructions] Hosting the call today is Joel Moskowitz, Ceradyne's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. With him are David Reed, President North American Operations; Jerry Pellizzon, Chief Financial Officer; Marc King, President, Ceradyne Armor Systems; and Cary Okawa, Corporate Controller. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Moskowitz, the company has requested that I read the following statement.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Moskowitz. Please go ahead, sir.\nJoel P. Moskowitz: Thank you very much, Nancy. This morning, before the opening of the stock market, we released our second quarter 2012 financial results. And now, as we've done for a number of years now, we'll follow a pattern of reviewing that release, having Jerry Pellizon, our CFO, give you some additional information and then open it to Q&A. The sales for the second quarter were $130.6 million, and that compared to last year in the same period of $145.4 million. Our net income for Q2 was $6.8 million or $0.28 per fully diluted share, and that compared to a net income in 2011 of $19.1 million or $0.76 per fully diluted share. In Q2, our fully diluted average shares outstanding were 24,307,290. A year ago, they were somewhat more in the same period, they were 25,223,757. Our gross profit margin was 28.1% of net sales, and that compared to last year of 36.4% in the same comparable quarter, that is the second quarter. The provision for income taxes, which Jerry will comment on, was 40.1% in Q2 this year, and that compared to a provision for income taxes last year in the same quarter of 34.8%. For the 6 months, our sales were $237 million, and that compared to $295.5 million in the same period last year, with our net income for the 6 months ending June 30, 2012, at $10.6 million or $0.44 per fully diluted share. And that was on 24,300,045 shares. Now that compares to a year ago of $42.7 million or $1.70 per fully diluted share, and that was on a higher number of shares, 25,171,897. Our gross margin for the 6 months ending June 30 was 27.8%. Now that compared to last year of 37.6%. The provision for income taxes in the 6 months ending June 30 was 39%. That compared to a provision for income taxes of 33.4% in the same period in 2011. New orders for the 3 months ending June 30, 2012, were $79.4 million compared to $108.8 million last year for the same period. And comparing 6 months to 6 months, our new orders were $160.2 million through June 30, 2012. That compared to $340.5 million for the comparable period last year, resulting in a backlog as of June 30 of $208.8 million, and that compared to last year's backlog of $230.8 million. Our cash, including cash equivalents and short-term investments, were down somewhat to $268.1 million at June 30, 2012, compared to $275 million last year -- or as of the end of last year, December 31, 2011. Now in my comments, I stated that although we were pleased that our -- the direction was right, that we increased from $0.16 per share in Q1 to $0.28 in Q2, that we continue to see short-term problems. And we have these short-term concerns regarding the anticipated solar rebound, its timing and when it occurs, we anticipate there'll be a reduced gross profit margins. In the second quarter alone, our losses from our Solar Crucible business, which a year ago, had the highest margins in the company, went into the negative and actually reduced our fully diluted earnings by $0.14. If we do not see improved shipment levels in both solar and defense, then the second half of 2012 operating results will likely be similar but could be somewhat greater than our first half 2012. I then went on to make some comments on the Solar business. These are based on inputs that we received from a host of sources, including, most recently, at a major exhibition in San Francisco and private meetings that I had in Europe. The demand for photovoltaic solar energy, as measured by solar installations, increased about 21% from 2010 to 2011, and it looks like it's going to increase again, perhaps to around 30 gigawatts worldwide, which is a more modest growth in 2012. That's not so bad, but the difficulty is that our Chinese customers continue to have excess capacity and high levels of inventory, which have yet to be reduced to levels justified by the demand. However, we continue to see increased solar use in China itself and the United States and India and other Asian countries. This is offset to some degree by reduced European demand. However, the macro outlook for the Solar business continues to be very positive, primarily due to reduced costs of the solar modules, which results in grid parity in some areas of the world, even with reduced or no government subsidies. Our strategy, we believe, is fairly clear-cut. What we're doing is we're reducing our costs in China through normal types of cost reduction, reduced personnel, while we're also focusing on several improved technologies and automations, which we expect will reduce some of our operating costs. I've also mentioned that we are in discussions with certain of our Chinese customers with the anticipation of resulting in a close long-term relationship. The Enhanced Combat Helmet, the production order that we've been discussing for some time of $170 million, has been delayed due to technical issues. These issues are being addressed by our staff, and we anticipate that with certain tooling adjustments, we will be in volume production probably late in the third quarter this year. I went on to discuss my recent visit to our ESK Ceramics subsidiary in Kempten, Germany, which was held to celebrate the 90th year since their founding in 1922. It was a terrific visit, frankly, enough so that I included it in our press release. I saw the largest component Ceradyne has ever made, a 10-meter long, that's in excess of 30 feet, PetroCeram ceramic sand screen, which by now probably has been shipped to the country of Bolivia, as well as discussing with the oil and gas personnel on site in Germany, a multitude of opportunities and quotes and orders that are being received. I had a long discussion with the head of research at ESK, which I then referred to as their technology innovation area, Dr. Christoph Lesniak, who is ESK's Chief Technology Officer. And we reviewed the patented ceramic microreactor progress, and it's a very welcomed reception at a large German chemical exposition, I believe it was in Frankfurt, called Achema. We also reviewed our progress on using our patent technology, the Ekagrip, on steel wire in order to provide a next-generation product for the slicing of silicon wafers for both semiconductor and solar silicon wafers. We also reviewed a program that I've discussed before, where we're going to take a very high thermal conducted ceramic powder and flake called boron nitride, mix it with an elastomer, a polymer, and end up with a plastic casing for the next generation of lithium ion battery casings for automobiles -- electric automobiles and LEDs, light emitting diodes, where they're going to use this as a heatsink, that was progressing very well. The reason that I mentioned this is that these are the products of the future which we believe will provide the basis for our continued diversification strategy and profitable future growth. Now, in conclusion, I tried to make it clear that our significant new product pipeline as well, of course, as our strong balance sheet which has a little more than $260 million as I said earlier, bode well for the future. However, our management, most of whom have been with us a very long time, are always pragmatic, and we will not let the future quag the present. We do both, we look at short-term, as well as long-term results. We'll continue to pay particular attention to the volatile solar market as we go forward. That concluded the report that we put out this morning, and we'll discuss that further. In general, I'm not happy, of course, with the turn down in the solar industry, and we're going to continue to focus on that. But I am very pleased with the continued progress of our company in these myriad of areas. And we'll discuss more of those, I'm sure you'll be asking questions about it in Q&A. And now, you'll have to excuse my throat. I've been traveling a lot, and I have a bit of a cold. But I think it's a good time to have Jerry Pellizzon, Ceradyne's Chief Financial Officer, give us a little more overview of the financial aspects of our report. Jerry?\nJerrold J. Pellizzon: Thank you very much, Joel. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us on the call. As a note, we filed our 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, with the SEC at sec.gov earlier today. As Joel stated, our sales declined sharply in the first half of the year in the second quarter of 2012, compared to the similar period last year, especially in shipments of body armor and crucibles. Overall, we had a decline in -- for the second quarter of 2012 versus the second quarter of 2011 of $15.9 million in crucibles, and we had lower shipments by our ESK subsidiary of $8.4 million, reflecting the softness in the European economy, particularly started during the second quarter for us. Sales of crucibles for the 3 months were just $3.5 million compared to $19.4 million in the corresponding period a year ago. So that was an 82% reduction. However, offsetting these declines, we had increased shipments in the nuclear industry by our Boron segment of $5.2 million. We had increased shipments of non-ECH combat helmets of $2.8 million over the same quarter last year, and we had increases of $1.1 million of our bio-glass product for use as an ingredient in toothpaste. So we're seeing favorable trends that way. Net sales for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, of body armor products were nearly unchanged, at $47.2 million compared to $48.1 million in the prior year. And as I mentioned, sales of our energy products amounted to $21 million, including solar pastes and other products besides the crucibles. And that was a decrease of $13 million or 38% from the $34 million in the prior year, as solar continued, obviously, to be pretty weak. Our sales of industrial products were down $2 million compared to the same quarter last year, the second quarter of each year. Again we saw weakness in the European economy, particularly in the Southern European economy. Total sales -- however, we did show an increase in sales of missile radomes, also, to the defense industry. They were up $1.5 million or 47% during the second quarter of this year. Our backlog was $208.8 million as of June 30, compared to $230.8 million at the same period at the same period -- the same point last year. The backlog for ceramic body armor was $93.7 million or 45% of the total backlog, compared to $84 million last year. And we expect that we will ship, substantially, all of our order backlog, as of the June 30 date, 2012, they will be shipped during 2012. Regarding gross profits for the quarter, we had a decline in gross profits of $16.3 million primarily due to lower gross profits in our Body Armor and Crucible business by $6.2 million and $9 million, respectively. For the 6 months, the gross profit was lower by $45 million and again, attributed to both body armor and ceramic crucibles by $20 million and $22 million, respectively. The main factors were lower average unit selling prices of our largest product line, body armor, also lower average unit selling prices of ceramic crucibles, and lower unit shipped of both items. These also impacted our ability to absorb our manufacturing overhead because of the decrease in the operating leverage. I'll note that the second quarter earnings were penalized by $0.14, as Joel mentioned, during the quarter, by our operating losses in the Crucible business. And at the -- for the first half of 2012, earnings were penalized $0.27 per fully diluted share. And we expect that, that will remain at that level for the balance of the year. For the second half of the year, our forecasted earnings are being reduced by a reduction in our planned shipments of body armor. We're taking a conservative stance. We received a stop note work notice regarding some corrective action that was requested by the government. So we're going to be reducing our forecast by $18 million of body armor sales, and that impacted our forecasted EPS by $0.17. We also have reduced our armor sales by $6 million for supplying ceramic armor plates for a sustainment order from one of our customers, and that reduced our EPS by $0.02. And then, the currency crisis and declining economy in Europe is causing us to reduce our total sales at ESK by $17.5 million, and that will reduce fully diluted shares by $0.16. And I've mentioned over -- in the call last quarter that the continuing weakness in the solar market, which is going to be penalizing our earnings $0.15 more than we had anticipated. So that's another factor in the decline. On a constant currency basis, as far as our sales in Europe, they were in the third -- 3 months ended June 12 -- June 30, 2012, were $40.7 million, which was a decrease of $5.2 million or 11.2% from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Our tax rate for the quarter was 40.1%, compared to 34.8% in the same quarter last year. This is the result of the fact that we're having losses in China where we did have a favorable tax rate, and so our overall rates is gone up because of that. In terms of operating cash flow, for the 6 months, we -- it was $21.3 million of cash from operations compared to $59 million for the 6 months ended June 30, 2011. And that $21.3 million was, of course, comprised of our net income of $10.6 million. We had $22.3 million of noncash charges that were offset by an increase of working capital of $12 million, resulting primarily from increased inventory levels. We also invested $10.5 million in CapEx, $9 million was spent to replace certain manufacturing equipment, and $1.5 million was spent to the start of our expansion of our manufacturing capacity of Ceradyne Boron Products in Quapaw, Oklahoma. We plan to spend a total of $9.9 million or $10 million for this fiscal year for this expansion. We also, during the quarter, invested about $1 million with our purchase of a minority interest in Chemtrix. Chemtrix develops and sells equipment and services based on a concept of executing R&D and process development in revolutionary micro reactors, with a direct scale opportunity to larger quantity production in mid-size reactors. For the quarter, our operating cash flow was $14.9 million compared to $40 million in the same quarter last year. Our free cash flow for the year-to-date was $10.2 million versus $40 million. We also, during the first 2 quarters of 2012, dispersed $7.3 million in cash -- for cash dividends to holders of our common stock. And we also, during the quarter, purchased 161,000 shares of our common stock at an aggregated cost of $4 million. We have $96 million remaining on that program that was authorized in 2011 by our Board of Directors. The EBITDA was -- for the quarter was $22 million compared to $39 million for the same period last year. Our CapEx, as I mentioned, is going to be -- was -- amounted to $10.5 million compared to $17 million. And we also are projecting that we'll have close to $285 million of cash by the end of the year. However, that does not include the fact that we will most likely will be having our convertible bond booked to us, so we'll be retiring that with $93.1 million. So we're left with a heavy cash balance at the end of the year. Joel?\nJoel P. Moskowitz: Okay. Jerry, thank you very much. I think the best way to proceed is to immediately go into question-and-answer, Nancy, because usually that will bring out the information that is of most interest to other people who have dialed in. So why don't you go into Q&A, Nancy?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take the first question from Josephine Millward from The Benchmark Company.\nJosephine Lin Millward - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division: Jerry, you went over the numbers very quickly. Are you reducing your EPS outlook for the year by about $0.50? Did I hear that correctly?\nJoel P. Moskowitz: It's in the range of about $0.40 -- or actually, $0.30 to $0.50. We, as I said, took some armor out of the back half of the year because some of the programs looked like they may be pushed. But we do have some upside to bring them back, and we have some -- we have a program that may -- that we may be awarded a win on a bid. But we did reduce them, and because of, as I mentioned, that stop notice pushed our body armor out. We had a push out of an order that we had in our forecast for another tranche, the remaining tranche of the sustainment order. And then, we had some foreign military sales that we had in the forecast that are being pushed out a little bit also.\nJosephine Lin Millward - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. On body armor, you can you talk about what you think sustainment will look like next year, whether we would see body armor at the same run rate?\nJoel P. Moskowitz: Yes, I think we'll let Dave Reed, and maybe Mark, chime in on that, since that's what they live with?\nDavid P. Reed: We don't have a clear picture. We heard from DLA that the first 3 months of sustainment will be at the same rate that we currently are. And then, they're going to review after that what their sustainment rate will be. It will be somewhat lower, but they have not given us any firm numbers yet. So that would be a production that we'll run from -- our current contract ends in February of next year. And so we'll have 3 continuing months of the same 25,000 unit run rate that we're currently at. And then after that, hopefully, we'll hear something later this fall on what their sustainment rate looks like.\nJosephine Lin Millward - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division: Final question, if solar continues at the current pace, can you talk about what your -- whether you would consider exiting the business? Or how do you plan to reduce losses there?\nJoel P. Moskowitz: Yes, I'll address that. We don't plan to exit the business, and we don't plan to do that because of what clearly is a continued demand, the numbers are something like, this is worldwide installations, 22 gigawatts in 2010, 26.7 gigawatts in 2011 and probably 30 gigawatts this year. The problem, clearly, is the overcapacity in China and the terrific levels of inventory that they have. Now the anticipation is that they'll work off those inventories, but there's no guarantee of that. So what we're doing, to directly answer your question, is we are reducing costs. We have 2 major facilities there. We are in active discussions about selling one of them, the smaller one that we opened in -- about 5 years ago. We've reduced our staff by -- significantly, I don't have the exact number, but it's probably close to 250 people. We have done a lot of things to batten down the hatches, so to speak. We are also involved in a research program to decrease our costs, the automation of a major process there, that looks very promising. And we have -- we're working together on an academia, with even another coating improvement. But the answer to your question is we are reducing costs, and we will continue to do it. We have no plans of exiting the business. We also are looking to make some agreements, which may or may not materialize, with several of our biggest accounts, for very long-term supply.\nOperator: We'll move to the next question, it comes from Avinash Kant from D.A. Davidson & Co.\nAvinash Kant - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: A few questions. So I think, Jerry, you were talking a little bit about the EPS impact, roughly $0.30 to $0.50 is what you're saying, in 2012. And I think you walked through some of the revenue impacts. So what kind of revenue impact, overall, are we thinking about, I didn't get all the line items?\nJerrold J. Pellizzon: Well, we're looking at an impact, possibly, to bring our guidance down to the $475 million to $485 million level, primarily those are the reduction in body armor of about $30 million. This is over our last guidance of the low end of $540 million, and then a reduction or a pushout of the ECH helmets, because of a delay in securing that order, of about $19 million. And those were the core components. And then of course, I mentioned that ESK, overall, is going to come in about $17 million lower than we had forecast when we gave the $540 million number. And that's primarily again because of softness in the European economy. They have about 56% of their sales into Europe, and they're seeing some softness there.\nAvinash Kant - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Okay. So now that the business seems to be tracking at a lower level, what -- are you thinking about initiatives of cost cutting, and what could you do there?\nJoel P. Moskowitz: Yes, I'll address that. We are always reviewing our costs and relationship to our shipments, and the numbers that Jerry is giving you are the most recent numbers, which change all the time. That's why the indication of where we are is in the -- in my comment, where I say that if we don't see improvement in the solar, particularly in defense, that we'll be in the -- roughly the same area that we were in, in the first half. And we've already reduced some costs. There is no plan right now internally, except for normal -- some directs that go up and down, we're very comfortable with the current structure that we have. We're always looking at some areas. But there's no cost cutting continued. Remember, the tone of this press release is to indicate that we're not happy with the solar and some difficulties on getting the final go-ahead on the helmet and other things that Jerry and Dave discussed. On the other hand, the basic underlying strategy that we have, which is the diversification, which includes, eventually, large inputs from new products, continues to be on track.\nAvinash Kant - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Okay. And another question I had was, Jerry, maybe could you give us an updated amount of how much do you have left in the share buyback program? And did you buy any shares in the quarter?\nJerrold J. Pellizzon: Sure. We have $96 million left. We purchased 4 million during the quarter, and we've purchased 161,000 shares.\nOperator: We'll take the next question from Jim Ricchiuti from Needham & Company.\nJames Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: I was wondering if you could comment a little bit more about the ECH. It sounds like you're only assuming somewhere in the neighborhood of $9 million to $10 million of shipments this year. Is there much risk to that? Are these issues that have surfaced -- is there a potential that, that could slip further?\nJoel P. Moskowitz: Dave?\nDavid P. Reed: Yes, let me talk about that. We have orders for low rate initial production of about $7.5 million. We hope to be in production on that part of the order later this quarter. Until we begin performing on the low rate initial order, they will not release the full order. The problems we've had have been really related to bringing the full factory up. We did pass our First Article Testing with limited equipment. And now, we've been bringing in all of our further equipment, and we have to get all of that equipment running at the same level. So there's multiple pieces of tooling, multiple presses, and all of our technology has to be verified and certified in place before we can bring that production. And we're just finalizing those steps now with the help of the government.\nJames Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Got it. And Jerry, I wonder if you can comment a little bit more about ESK and what they're seeing in Europe? How did business fall off as the quarter unfolded? Can you say what business -- what the decline was in Europe at ESK? And what's the downside, do you think, going forward?\nJerrold J. Pellizzon: Well, they experienced decline, first of all, in our automotive business, and particularly in Southern Europe, because they went to 4-day work weeks from 5-day work weeks, so there was a reduction in overall production. And we have some unique products for the automobile industry that have a good margin for us. So the mix -- that mix, that reduction in math, plus they had an increase in armor shipments, was a negative mix for the quarter. And so that really hurt the quarter. And we're continuing to forecast the same types of quarters for the next 2 quarters. It just doesn't seem like the crisis in Europe is going to go away anytime quickly. And the order flow was a little light, and so we took the number down overall. They'll end up doing about $150 million this year, we had them in there for $167 million. And their -- the impact on our EPS meant that we had to take our overall EPS down by $0.16 because of those declines. And so I mean, it's -- they're still a great business, they got some great niche products, good margin products. But as we saw in 2009 with that recession, they are, in Europe, quite susceptible to some volatility in their earnings and their sales.\nJames Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Got it. And one final question, if I may. Your sales into the nuclear industry are, roughly, I guess, about $11 million in the quarter, that was particularly strong. What kind of visibility do you have in that? How does the rest of that business -- how does the business look for the rest of the year in that area?\nJerrold J. Pellizzon: Well, it's going to mirror last year's sales. But you have to remember that last year, we benefited by having $8 million of sales because 2 new nuclear power plants, one in Finland and one in France, came online. And so we, in the fourth quarter, were positively benefited by $8 million. We don't have any -- right now we don't have any visibility there for the rest of the year of any shipments like that. So the sales will be comparable to the nuclear industry as they were last year.\nJoel P. Moskowitz: Yes, I'll make a comment on nuclear in general. As you know, I'm very supportive of our efforts coming out of Quapaw, Oklahoma, which is called Ceradyne Boron Products. We make this isotope Boron 10, which absorbs thermal neutrons 5x greater than what they call normal non-isotopic material. And because of that, we believe, which is one of the reasons we bought that company, that the future will include those materials in new reactors. What I want to make the point of, our big opportunity is in 2 areas for the future: one is China, where they talk about 200 reactors over a 25-year period. That could be $1 billion worth of business for Ceradyne, and we're working very hard on that with relationships with some of the major designer and fabricators of nuclear power plants. And the other opportunity is here in the United States, working with the Department of Energy on the next generation of small reactors, which are called SNRs, small nuclear reactors, and that's also a very exciting opportunity. So the short run, as Jerry said, will probably mirror last year. But we're doing a lot there, and I will just repeat Jerry's comment. This report we're putting in a lot of CapEx in Oklahoma in order to increase our capacity, particularly on the separation of the isotope Boron 10.\nOperator: And we'll go to Colin Rusch from ThinkEquity next.\nColin W. Rusch - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division: Can you talk a little bit about the leverage that you're getting out of the VIOX platform at this point? It sounds like you've made some good progress for those products, so I'd love to get a quick update there.\nJoel P. Moskowitz: Yes. VIOX is -- they're really doing quite well, considering that when we bought them, a high percentage of their market was focused on the conducting pace that go into manufacturing of the photovoltaic solar cell modules. And the reason they're holding their own and doing a little bit better, actually, is because of the expansion of what's called bio-glass, which is a sodium phosphosilicate material that's being added by GlaxoSmithKline in their toothpaste. So we're going to put more CapEx in there if we get a commitment, which we think we will, for a fourfold increase of our bio-glass for toothpaste. We love that opportunity because that's really steady eddie. People are going to brush their teeth even in bad economic times.\nColin W. Rusch - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division: Great. And then, as you guys look at gross margin performance through the balance of this year and to next year, I mean, are there some things that we should be paying attention to in terms of drags or some benefit that we may not be seeing at this point in the model?\nJoel P. Moskowitz: Well, I'll make a comment then I'll let Jerry chime in on it. First, of course, we're paying higher taxes because we don't have that benefit of higher sales and profits in China. So you're going to see that. Now that's not the gross margins. Second, even though earlier, to Jim Ricchuiti's question, I said we're really not doing anything significant in our operations on cost reduction except as it relates to solar because of our confidence in the future. In reality, we always bring our workforce in line with our actual shipment level. So I would think that we would see some improvement throughout the company and gross margins as we go forward. Jerry, did you want to comment...\nJerrold J. Pellizzon: Yes, I think a couple of other factors that underlie our gross margin are -- our gross profit percentage is that, remember you have to consider that we're -- we have a gross margin loss in our Crucible business, amounting to about $4 million. We have about $1 million gross margin loss in our Canadian operations. So right there, you've got $5 million that's negative, let alone contributing anything. So that's something to be considered. If you were to pull those 2 operations out, we have a pretty decent-looking gross margin percentage line item and operating income line item. The other thing to consider is that at this level that we've adjusted our sales level to, to reflect some armor pushout, the margins are very elastic so that they're very sensitive towards any increase that we pick up. So if we can pick up any additional business, we've got our fixed cost covered, and they would contribute to an increase in our margin drastically. And if we can get our Chinese operation or our crucible operation in 2013 to level out and get back to some type of normal [indiscernible] business, we're going to see a substantial improvement also.\nOperator: And we'll move next to Sam Dubinsky from Wells Fargo.\nSam Dubinsky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: How should we think about ESK gross margins in the back half of the year on the lower revenue run rate?\nJoel P. Moskowitz: Yes. On the back half of the year, you're going to be -- they're going to be probably in the low 30 range. And so that's kind of what we're thinking right now. They were -- that's just gross margins. They were in the mid-30s in the first quarter, and they were, last year, they were nearly at 20% EBIT margin as a percentage of net sales. So we're taking them down to 30 points overall on the gross margin level.\nSam Dubinsky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Great. And can you also discuss the tone from ESK customers and what they're saying? And how does it compare to the prior downcycle in 2008, 2009? Are there, anecdotally, any evidence it's a little better or it's shaping up sort of following a similar pattern? Can you just, sort of, discuss what your customers are saying in Europe? And I have a -- and one last follow-up question.\nJoel P. Moskowitz: Well I could be handle that a little bit since I just came back from there. The fact is our customers seem to be confused. They're not sure of their own businesses. Recently, there's been some surprises on the upside where they didn't have inventories and they've been placing emergency expedited orders. So I would say that because of the reduction in auto business, where we sell the EKagrip, I don't know that we can -- I can give you a very definitive answer on what Audi and Mercedes think, except that our product works very well and we're in all these automobiles. I can tell you that the general tenor internally is very positive in ESK. And that's because of the acceptance of these newer products. This reduction is a little bit in the fluid handling, they're just not selling our customers, the biggies are growing for us [indiscernible], they've slowed down a bit. I'm not sure that they anticipated that. And so our customers themselves are having difficulty managing their own inventory level, which is usually a sign of what they think the future will be. So I don't think I gave you a particularly good answer, but it's the only answer I have.\nSam Dubinsky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then, you've also mentioned in past, you're going to be a little bit more acquisitive. Has the recent softness across your business segments changed your strategy, either accelerating it or paring it back?\nJoel P. Moskowitz: No. No. We're really pleased with the Chemtrix deal. It's a small one, and we own about, I think, 30%. And we have an option to buy the rest over the next 2 years, which we most likely will. And that is involving the fluid reactors primarily for pharmaceuticals. That's going to work out very, very well, and we're working on other acquisitions right now. Again, they've tend to be smaller, not as small as the Chemtrix deal, where they are involving state-of-the-art technologies for making light emitting diodes where they need special tooling in what's called the MOCVD process. So no, we're not stopping. In fact, Bob Miller, who was our -- is our Vice President in charge of our corporate acquisitions and business development, has really got his hands full now, we'll be doing some relationships that won't be strictly acquisitions, we're going to do a joint venture in Europe on making the diamond wire for slicing, we'll do that with people who make this deal and who have other expertise. We'll do all that. We'll be in the German or Austria area. And we're also looking at some other opportunities. So the answer is no, Sam. When we seal deals that are -- meet our criteria, we're going to do them, and we're in a position to do them because of our cash position.\nSam Dubinsky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Good. And actually, I have one last question. Just on -- in terms of the Boron business, I know it's pretty lumpy. Can you separate out what percentage is nuclear versus semiconductors? And how should we think about the linearity of that business through the rest of the year?\nJerrold J. Pellizzon: Well, the nuclear will run about $25 million to $27 million of the total, and the semiconductor will be around $11 million.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Jiwon Lee from Sidoti & Company.\nJiwon Lee - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Jerry, just wanted to get back on the crucible side, if I can, with the cost reduction steps that you're taking, what would have to be, sort of, kind of the quarterly run rate to at least breakeven on an operating margin side?\nJerrold J. Pellizzon: Well, we're -- it's kind of improved substantially. What's happened is that the average selling prices have declined nearly between 25% and 30% on most of our parts from the same -- from the first half of 2011. So we're going to have to see an increase of probably to the $10 million level in sales, and that's just where we need to be to break it even.\nJiwon Lee - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay, that's very clear. And Joel, you highlighted several small, but nonetheless, interesting product opportunities. And I wonder what you are most excited about mid to long-term in terms of the revenue opportunities among these products?\nJoel P. Moskowitz: Yes. I am excited about it because -- I'm going to -- in my closing comments, I'm going to make a remark about the whole strategy that we'll continue to move forward in. But clearly, the most short-term excitement is in PetroCeram. This is a market that is about a $1 billion market. It exists right now, and the existing products, which come from 13 major players, are all metal, they're all stainless steel. And they tend to be kind of similar, and they work in some areas and in other areas where you have a lot of prop ins from frac-ing or high velocity oil or gas. They just wear out, and they're always going to wear out. Our product is more expensive, but it won't wear out, at least it won't wear out for years, and years, and years, and years. The facts are, we never had a failure, and the longest product went into January of 2010. So it's 2.5 years ago. We did about $1 million or so last year in shipments, dollars. This year, we'll do $45 million in shipments. And the future looks very bright. So that's number one. Number two, you have the flow reactors. That's a product that's been in the development stage since we acquired ESK. And that market -- we have 2 studies, one is a $100-million market, the other is a $500-million market. And we have been in this situation until we did the acquisition of Chemtrix, where we could only sell the ceramic portion. That means that we didn't have the capability of selling the entire system, which includes precision pumps and heaters and coolers and valves, et cetera. We would just sell what's called the chip, the ceramic part. Now we're going to be a total integrated company with Chemtrix. And you'll see in the next 12 months probably a low-million dollar kind of prototypes, but we expect that will also continue to increase. The numbers are that using this technology you can increase the ability to make pharmaceutical drugs between 40 and a hundredfold because of the nature of the reactions. And the other product that I mentioned, where we have really no sales right now, but we're in a consortium with BMW and Samsung and the German government to develop these next-generation casings for batteries for cars. And when I was in Germany, recently, they've actually set up a prototype facility now, where we're making the product, we make the boron nitride. We buy the organic plastics, if you will. But then, we have a mixing system, and we're making product right now. And that's more speculative. It's also a huge, huge market. But first will be the PetroCeram ceramic sand screens.\nOperator: We'll take the next question from Rand Gesing from Neuberger Berman.\nRand Gesing: On the ECH, it sounds sort of -- it doesn't sound like it's a big issue you're having, it sounds, sort of, like a normal ramp issue. Is that correct?\nJerrold J. Pellizzon: Well, we take the issue very seriously because it's a difficult technology, it's the cutting-edge of helmet manufacturing. The specification is very rigorous with the rifle fire thread. So although we believe that we'll have a positive outcome there, I can't say that it's not of concern, but we have very good technical people working on it, and we expect, as I said, to be in production later in this quarter on the EKagrip order.\nRand Gesing: Okay. And then, Joel, can you just characterize for us, within the solar food chain, I guess maybe there's inventory everywhere, but when you're speaking of inventory, are you talking about panels, are you talking about crucibles? I just would like to just get a better sense.\nJoel P. Moskowitz: We're talking about wafers. If -- there's high level of wafers at our customers. And in addition, if there's high level of wafers at their customers who are assembling the modules, then they don't -- they just don't have to melt this much silicon.\nRand Gesing: Right. And did they give you any sort of visibility on that at all, or are you just going to have to just see them start pooling crucibles at some point for you now?\nJoel P. Moskowitz: We don't -- we really don't believe that. So what we do is really -- it's very hard to get a handle on it. But we just go by what they're buying. And right now, they're buying about 6,000 crucibles a quarter compared to a year ago, almost 30,000. Okay. I think that we'll call it a day, Nancy. And I do want to wrap this up. Are you there?\nOperator: Yes, sir.\nJoel P. Moskowitz: Okay. So we won't take any more calls. But I do want to remind everyone of Ceradyne. Look, many of you, all of you, actually, who were asking questions and write reports, understand our company pretty well. And in 2007, we shipped $535 million of armor to our American soldiers. And we made a great deal of money on that. And at that time, and even before that, with the acquisition in '04 of ESK, we had adopted this idea that we had to be diversified away from the defense. The defense is very important to us. Most likely, it will continue at a pretty good rate, both the helmets and the armor. And we are moving in that direction, and then, we had effectively a windfall in the Solar business. We always can make -- we're -- in my opinion, we're the very best. The technology starts at Georgia Tech in the '70s in order to make nose cones for missiles, which as Jerry said earlier, is a pretty good business right now since we're the only ones left in the United States really that are making these types of ceramic nose cones. So we were in that business, and that absolutely exploded to where it raised our earnings -- I mean, even last year, where it was already tapering off, as everyone knows, we did well over $3 a share. But the basic underlying ideas of ESK and technology acquisitions that we'll add to the -- nothing has changed, nothing has changed in that. What has changed our short-term aspects of what turned out to be a very volatile business in solar that rather than making a lot of money, is losing some money. And we're moving in that direction, I told you that we're going to reduce one facility in Tianjin, and we're reducing staff. And on the other side of it, we're increasing a very clever idea about our mold making and automation, and we're working on a fairly exciting new coating on that product. But the basic idea of the company, the idea of we're in advanced materials, primarily structural non-oxides, if you will, and that's as sound as the day we started the company or a lot more so. And I'm very enthused about it. I'm sorry, my voice is a little hoarse, but that's what happens when you fly around all the time. So we're okay, and we're going to continue to move in these directions. And hopefully -- solar will get a little bit better, we certainly can count on it. And with Jerry and Dave and Mark in the defense area, I'm pretty comfortable about that. But don't lose sight of the total picture. We're pretty much on target. Thanks a lot for everyone's continued interest. I appreciate the analysts staying on top of things. It's a good crowd. That will conclude our call, Nancy.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Again, that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 1, "year": 2012, "date": "2012-04-24 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, April 24, 2012. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nMatt Ginter: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter business review. With me today are Inge Thulin, 3M President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Meline, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to mention a few calendar items. We will announce our second quarter earnings on Thursday, July 26, and our third quarter earnings on Tuesday, October 23. In addition, we are planning to host our next Investor Day in St. Paul on Thursday, November 8. We'll provide more details out in the future. But for now, please hold these dates on your calendars. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 2. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. So let's begin today's review, and I'll turn the program over to Inge. Please turn to Slide #3.\nInge G. Thulin: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call today. I'm very pleased to report that we're off to a good start this year, with positive sales, operating income and EPS growth. In fact, we achieved an all-time Q1 sales record of $7.5 billion. Industrial and Transportation, SS&PS, Health Care and Consumer and Office all performed well, while weakness in Electronics hurt Display and Graphics and Electro and Communications. As we said, we look for the electronics market to pick up as the year goes on. Geographically, for 3M, the Americas were strong. Asia Pacific was somewhat slower, and Western Europe held its own with very good operational discipline. For the company, operating margins improved to nearly 22%, with 5 out of 6 businesses above 20%. We executed well, and the result was a 7% increase in EPS to $1.59, including a $0.04 charge for a voluntary early retirement program and some miscellaneous restructuring. In February, we announced a 7% dividend increase, 3M's 54th consecutive annual increase. The first quarter dividend payment combined with Q1 share repurchases of over $500 million resulted in a first quarter return to shareholders of nearly $1 billion. So we're off to a good start, one that sets the right tone for the rest of the year and one that gives us confidence in our ability to deliver even against weak segments and regions and against an uncertain global economy. I thank the 3M team for their outstanding work that achieved these very good results. The quarter highlights their ability to manage 3M's embedded systems and tools to drive operational excellence, and I'm extremely pleased with the outcome. Now David will take you through the detail of the quarter. David?\nDavid W. Meline: Thank you, Inge. Let's begin with sales. Please turn to Slide #4. First quarter sales were $7.5 billion, up 2.4% year-on-year. Organic local currency growth was 1.8% in the first quarter, with volumes up just slightly and selling prices up 1.7%. Acquisitions added 1.5% to sales in the quarter, and foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by nearly 1 percentage point. On a geographic basis, total growth was the strongest in the combined Latin America/Canada region at more than 8%. Organic local currency growth was nearly 12% in the quarter, so our teams here continued to do an excellent job of building the business. Currency impacts reduced sales in the region by nearly 4%, largely due to weakness in the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real. In the United States, sales grew 6.3% with double-digit increases in both Industrial and Transportation and in Safety, Security and Protection Services. The U.S. manufacturing sector remains quite robust and we are seeing some good growth as a result. Sales in Asia Pacific declined by 2% in the quarter, reflecting slower year-on-year demand in global consumer electronics, along with slower growth in China. Both were fully anticipated in our prior outlook, so no real surprises here. On the electronics side, we continue to expect the market to turn positive around midyear. As for China, we are expecting below trend growth in the second quarter with better growth rates returning in the second half of the year. Sales in Europe were basically flat in Q1, with strength in Middle East Africa and Central East Europe offset by year-on-year declines in the West. In aggregate, the economies in Western Europe have stabilized at least for the moment, so things are not getting worse sequentially, but they are also not getting better. We built our 2012 plan on this basis, so thus far, things are progressing as expected. Please turn to Slide 5 for a more detailed look at our income statement for the quarter. From an operating standpoint, we are quite pleased with our performance in the first quarter. As expected, the economy is not giving us much in terms of underlying growth, but we have a firm handle on discretionary spending and are off to a good start to 2012. Sales and gross profit both increased around 2.5% in the first quarter, operating income grew 3.5% and earnings per share rose 6.7%. Operating margins increased 20 basis points year-on-year to 21.8%. Breaking down the margin change, first quarter selling price increases, net of raw material inflation, added 0.8 percentage points to operating margin, and other productivity added 0.3%. Foreign exchange impacts were a headwind of 0.3%, and the combination of higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense hurt operating margins by 0.6%. Again, operating margins improved by 20 basis points in total. Total SG&A increased $19 million in the quarter, largely related to the voluntary early retirement and restructuring actions mentioned by Inge, and R&D investment increased $13 million, about half of which related to these same events. Earnings for the quarter rose 6.7% to $1.59 per share. The tax rate was 28.8% in the quarter, up just slightly versus last year. Average diluted shares outstanding were 706 million, down nearly 3% year-on-year, which added $0.04 of benefit in the quarter. On the whole, our businesses are executing very well in this period of softer economic growth. Let's now review our first quarter performance on a business-by-business basis. Please go to Slide #6. Industrial and Transportation had an excellent quarter, with sales growing at 9%. Sales increased in every region of the world, with the United States leading the way at 13% growth. As I mentioned, the manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy is growing nicely. Europe and Latin America/Canada grew at 6% and Asia Pacific grew 8%. We posted double-digit sales increases in a number of areas, including Industrial Abrasives and Automotive OEM. We also grew double digits in our fastest-growing Aerospace business. Aerospace has grown tremendously over the past few years and recently was elevated to become 3M's newest division. It's a great business poised for even faster growth. Organic local currency growth was 7% in the quarter. Acquisitions added over 3 points of growth, largely related to Winterthur in the abrasives market and Alpha Beta in industrial tapes, both of which are tracking well versus our expectations. Operating income was $600 million, up 16%, and we improved margins by 1.4 percentage points to 22.5%. The Industrial and Transportation team has done an outstanding job transforming what was once a low-growth to no-growth business into a true industrial powerhouse. Now let's move to the Health Care. Sales grew 2% to $1.3 billion, with broad-based organic growth across the majority of our portfolio. We drove strong double-digit sales growth in health information systems this quarter. This is an excellent growth business, and the industry leader in solutions for coding and classification of patient data. We work with more than 5,000 health care organizations worldwide, offering software solutions that improve productivity and enhance the accuracy of patient records. Earlier this month, we further strengthened this business by acquiring CodeRyte, a leader in clinical natural language processing technology and computer-assisted coding solutions for outpatient providers. We also posted mid-single-digit growth in Food Safety, Skin and Wound care and Infection Prevention, and oral care sales rose at a low single-digit rate. Sales declined in drug delivery systems against a challenging first quarter comp. On a geographic basis, sales increased 11% in Asia Pacific, 9% in Latin America/Canada and 3% in the United States. European sales declined 6% in the quarter due to economic softness and ongoing austerity measures in many countries. Developing markets remain a bright spot for Health Care with double-digit sales growth in the first quarter. The health care industry is just beginning to take off in many developing nations, and we plan to expand our investments here as 2012 progresses. Operating income in Health Care increased 9% to $402 million, a strong result in an industry with its share of challenges at the moment, and margins were 31.4%. Now let's look at the Consumer and Office business. Sales again topped $1 billion this quarter, a 4% increase year-on-year. Our do-it-yourself business grew at a double-digit rate via a combination of acquired and organic growth. Recall that in October of 2011, we acquired the GPI Group, a French producer of tapes, hooks, insulation and floor protection products. GPI buys us speed and critical mass in the large European home improvement channels. On a geographic basis, Europe grew 16% in the first quarter, with positive gains from the GPI acquisition, offset in part by lower organic volumes. We drove 9% sales growth in the combined Latin America/Canada region and 7% in Asia Pacific, while sales declined 1% in the U.S. Consumer and Office generated $234 million of operating income in the quarter, up 9% year-on-year, and margins improved by 90 basis points to 22.4%. Let's move on to Safety, Security and Protection Services business. Sales were just shy of $1 billion in the first quarter, up 6% year-on-year. We drove high-single-digit sales growth in our Personal Safety business, influenced by strong manufacturing activity in many areas of the world. The outlook here remains very positive. Our Roofing Granules business also grew nicely in Q1, driven by warm weather conditions, as well as some inventory rebuild at the OEM level. First quarter sales declined in the Security Systems business against a tough comp year-on-year. Looking geographically, sales rose 16% in Latin America/Canada, 10% in the United States, 4% in Asia Pacific and sales declined 3% in Europe. Good unit growth and excellent factory efficiency drove a 16% increase in operating income for Safety, Security and Protection Services. Margins improved 2.2 percentage points to 23.6%. Now let's look at our Display and Graphics segment. Last year, first quarter was particularly strong for D&G, so we faced a tough comparison in Q1 of 2012. Sales were $832 million in Q1, down 12% year-on-year. Optical Systems sales fell 28% in the quarter, which was all LCD TV-related. Quarterly comparisons in Optical get easier as 2012 progresses. Sales grew nicely in both Architectural Markets and Commercial Graphics. Worldwide sales declined just slightly in traffic safety systems, although U.S. sales in this business were quite strong. On a regional basis, sales rose 9% in the United States, 7% in Latin America/Canada. Sales declined 11% in Europe and 19% in Asia Pacific. Operating profits in Display and Graphics were $163 million, and margins were nearly 20% for the quarter. Finally, let let's move to Electro and Communications. Sales were $808 million, down 3%. As expected, our electronics-related businesses posted sales declines in the first quarter, reflecting lower year-on-year customer production levels. Our 2012 plan called for an upturn in electronics sometime around midyear, and this remains our best estimate. We did see sequential sales improvement in Q1, so that is certainly a positive sign. In the Electrical Markets business, sales were up year-on-year, while telecommunications declined a few percentage points. On a geographic basis, sales increased 5% in the United States, 4% in Latin America/Canada, but declined 7% in Asia Pacific and 6% in Europe. Operating income in Electro and Communications was $168 million in the first quarter, and margins were nearly 21%, a good result in a tough growth environment. This wraps up our business segment discussion. Please turn to Slide #7. Free cash flow for the quarter was $567 million, up $65 million year-on-year, so we're off to a very good start in 2012. Bear in mind also that this amount includes a voluntary $250 million contribution to our U.S. defined benefit plan, something we've not done before in Q1. Therefore, the underlying increase is much higher. Our pension funded status is in good shape despite today's low interest rate environment, and we are continuing to stay ahead of the curve. Working capital was a net year-on-year benefit in the first quarter, as our businesses are doing a nice job of managing capital in this environment. Lower tax payments and higher income also boosted free cash flow. Capital expenditures were $261 million, up $30 million versus first quarter of last year, and we remain on track to invest $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion for 2012 in total. First quarter pension and OPEB contributions totaled $337 million, which was $276 million higher than Q1 of last year. This was factored into our 2012 plan, and you may remember that we discussed it on last quarter's call. As you can see on the bottom of this slide, we expect to contribute a similar amount in the second quarter. For the full year, we anticipate contributions of about $1 billion to our pension and OPEB plans. Free cash flow conversion was 50%, a 4 point improvement versus the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted for pension and OPEB contributions, conversion was 80% this quarter versus 52% in Q1 of 2011. We returned nearly $1 billion to shareholders in Q1. Specifically, we paid $410 million in cash dividends in the quarter, and gross share repurchases were $524 million. That wraps up our discussion of the first quarter. Now I will turn the call back to Inge.\nInge G. Thulin: Thank you, David. So far today, we have been focused on the first quarter, but I would like to change the subject for a few minutes and address the topic that is generating a lot of enthusiasm and support with our employees and with our customers. That is our new vision for 3M. I sense that the vision for the entire company could really inspire our employees and position us positively with our customers. So we set out to capture the essence of 3M with a clear vision that is both timely and timeless. I shared this with my direct reports on my first day in office and with all employees worldwide a few days later. I introduced it earlier to connect immediately with employees and to send a very clear message about 3M's direction, purpose and future. Today, it's my pleasure to share it with you. Please turn to Slide 8. I believe this capture well the essence of 3M: technology, products and innovation. It reflects what we do for our customers every day, advance, enhance and improve. It sets a stretch goal for all of us, every company, every home and every life, all around the world. From a performance standpoint, if we can make good progress toward realize our vision, we can look forward to many more good quarters and many more years of increasing value for our shareholders. We have had a super response from our employees, very supportive and excited. It was very encouraging to me also to see how our customers have responded. Whenever we meet with our customer, we share the vision, and it resonates very, very well with them. Of course, a vision means very little if you don't perform. With that, let's turn to Slide 9 for our outlook for the rest of the year. We believe our expectations about the global end market trends are still valid, and we are continuing to manage with them top of mind. Industrial markets continue to show strength, while Consumer and Health Care markets remain steady. We are seeing some early improvements in the semiconductor market, and we expect the electronics industry to pick up midyear. Geographically, the western hemisphere is doing well, with Latin America leading the way. Our teams there are doing a terrific job. Western Europe has stabilized, but at low levels. Growth in the Asia Pacific region is slow because of China, Japan and the electronic markets, but we still anticipate reacceleration in the second half of the year. As we are executing well and keeping the right balance between cost and investment, the Q1 results give us confidence to accelerate a number of targeted investment in technology, business building and emerging markets. Overall, we are looking at a range of $30 million to $50 million. This investment will support faster technology development in promising areas such as biotech and lighting. We will also invest to grow our Oil and Gas and Mining business, a segment with big potential. Of course, we know this market very well, and with added focus and investment, we will build a stronger position for 3M. Aerospace, as David mentioned, is another opportunity we will looking to build our strength. We will also invest more in emerging markets. For example, health care in Latin America and China, and in personal safety everywhere, another high-growth, high-potential space. So looking ahead, we believe the right outlook for the year is an earnings range of $6.35 to $6.50. We are raising the lower end of the range by $0.10. We continue to expect organic volume increases within the 2% to 5% range, and margins in the range of 21% to 22.5%. It's still early in the year, and as always, we'll continue to manage prudently even as we build for the future. So with that, we are now pleased to take your questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.\nSteven E. Winoker: Just maybe starting with a little bit more picture around the inventory stocking dynamics that led to the 10 basis points of volume increase. What were the puts and takes especially around the Electronics side? Do you think you're through the destocking elements? Is it improving sequentially? And when might you think about or are you planning for a rebound on that front?\nDavid W. Meline: Sure. So what I would say, Steve, is that inventory stock and destock was not a big feature of the results overall this quarter. We saw, certainly, last year, quite dramatic impacts on the business as we saw destocking take place. This quarter, we didn't really see anything significant in any of the segments. And that included Electronics. So Electronics remained weak, as we talked about, but we continue to believe that we'll see this uptick develop around midyear. So very much consistent with what we had expected previously.\nSteven E. Winoker: Okay. And then on pricing power and particularly in Health Care, as a company, you've often talked about high 20s being kind of a sustainable run rate in Health Care margins. And clearly, you were back up over -- well over 30% this quarter. I mean, to what extent was that a function of something that's sustainable versus just taking down expenses for one quarter to help meet your commitments?\nInge G. Thulin: Well, you're right. We have said we would like to run that business in the high 20s, and that is our objective. And as I made some comments, we are now looking to accelerate our investments, specifically, in the emerging markets, where we have big opportunities. And it's very nice to see that the leverage is coming based on the investment we have done earlier in Health Care, specifically in emerging market, but also in Consumer and Office. So we have done investment there the last couple of years, and we now start to see the growth coming. It is a mix issue, which is positive for us due to the fact that many of the products that we are selling for Health Care, specifically into the developed economy, is adding a lot of value. Meaning that we're able to maintain very good margins as we penetrate more there. And in the emerging market now, we start to see that we take good market share, and the penetration is accelerating. China specifically, we will continue to make more investment as we go, and Latin America, as well as I called out on the call. But you are right, we would like to run it in the upper 20s. And by doing so, I think we will be able to really build out a good position on a global base.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from Citi.\nDeane M. Dray: Since the transition occurred during the quarter, this would be a good opportunity to hear from you, and maybe this would be better at a Analyst Day, but we don't have that luxury. But what areas are you focused on for the company in terms of why it might be different? And specifically, getting a lot of questions about your thoughts on the growth rate over the cycle, that 7% to 8% that had been set. So just a little bit more color in terms of what imprint we might expect over the near term and then very specifically, how you're feeling about that 7% to 8% growth target.\nInge G. Thulin: Well, thank you. First of all of all, my target and objective and focus is to deliver the plan for 2012. I was part of the team to build the plan here, and that's important for us. And this, as you know, is a volatile time, and we are absolutely focused to make sure that we deliver what we have promised you for this year. So that's initially what is very important for us. And it's not only important for me, it's important for the whole team, and the transition have gone very, very well. And it was a very solid and robust process that we had in place. And I think this is also a good time to thank George for everything he did in that transition, which was just extraordinary, at least for me and for the team here. Relative to the growth, first of all, this is an organization that is responding very well to stretch targets. And I think there is more elements to the business on a holistic way than just the top line growth. And at least, for me, 2 other very important metrics is margins and return of the invested capital. So we are focusing on that as well. So I would say that the 7% to 8% is a long-term target for 3M, and something that our organization really are responding very well to. And I would say the mindset in 3M today is changed versus many years ago, where we believe today that we can win and we have a capability to do so. So we are not at 7% to 8% as of yet, as we know, but it's a long-term target for us. And our organization, whatever we put out in terms of really tough stretch targets are responding very well.\nDeane M. Dray: That's very helpful. And then from a follow-up, it is interesting that there is a change that we've not seen previously, and that's you're talking -- calling out 2 end markets where you'd like to see growth, both oil and gas and aero. And just give us a sense what that competitive edge might be that 3M would bring to both of those end markets.\nInge G. Thulin: Yes. We have been in those markets for some time, but at least in my mind and the organization's mind here in total, we have not given full attention in terms of additional investment in order to accelerate our growth. So if you combine oil and gas and mining, that's a big market in total, which is, for us, where we can utilize many technology platforms in order to expand our presence into that market. So I think it's a -- in terms of integrated safety, protect and renew. It's also, for us, to go into water management and filtration, and make sure that we add services into the whole environment. So that's a business that, I believe and we believe here, by combining them and make sure that we make additional investments into research and development and a strong front, then, in terms of commercialization, really can move forward into and expand and accelerate. And we will call that business the natural resource management and extraction division that will be formed. Relative to aerospace, for us, if you think about our technology platforms there, which is everything from composites films, abrasive, masking product and personal protection, with all platforms there, that's a good opportunity for us to enabling lighter, safer, quieter aircraft constructed faster. So that's a business that is growing fast for us as we speak, but we believe with additional technologies that we can accelerate that even more. So we're very excited about that. And as David said, we move that from a department to a division recently, meaning more focus and investment will go into that business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal from FBR Capital Markets.\nAjay Kejriwal: Just maybe first on the pricing raw materials, very impressive positive contribution in the quarter. So maybe talk a little bit about what you saw on the raw material side. And then what's your expectation on pricing raw for the rest of the year?\nDavid W. Meline: Right. So Ajay, in terms of price raw materials, we did see -- we continued to see some level of raw material cost increases in Q1 to the tune of about 2%. So if you may recall, last year, we had raw material cost inflation of a little bit over 4%. So obviously, we see some moderation, and we continue to believe 1% to 2% for the year in terms of raw material cost increases is going to take place. And then in terms of pricing, yes, we picked up 1.7% in the quarter, more than offsetting raw material cost. And that was basically a consequence of the carryover effect of the pricing actions that we took last year. So if you look at that through the year, of course, that will have less of an effect on a comparable basis as we move through the year. But we think it's reasonable. We had said 0% to 1% on price for the year. It's reasonable to think that we'll get to the top end of that range as we go through this year.\nAjay Kejriwal: Got it. And then on SG&A, looks like you exclude the restructuring, flattish year-over-year, so very impressive. Maybe talk about some of the initiatives that you have on cost control and then what are the expectation on SG&A for the rest of the year.\nDavid W. Meline: Yes, right. So as we had said, as we had the meeting in New York in December, we really were posturing ourselves this year for a weaker growth environment in the first half. And frankly, unfortunately, that's developed as we expected. We expect that to be true again here in the second quarter, a pretty weak economic environment. And so we've taken a posture to really be carefully managing our discretionary spending. The other part we saw come through very positively in the first quarter, which we were pleased with, is really the factories were running very efficiently in the quarter. Lean Six Sigma is a key focus there, and that's certainly coming through, including in a lot of the newer locations that we've put in place around the world over recent years. So combination of carefully managing spending and also running the factories effectively. As we look forward, then, we expect, as we go into the second quarter here, to maintain a tight rein on spending. And then secondly, as Inge mentioned, we are more confident now of the outlook for the year, and we believe it appropriate to continue to selectively look as to where we can target some additional investments.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nAbhiram Rajendran: This is Abhi Rajendran calling in for John. A few quick questions on M&A. One, could you provide an update on the pending Avery Dennison Office and Consumer acquisition and what sort of timing you're looking at to close that transaction?\nInge G. Thulin: Yes. We are still in that regulatory process as we have talked to you about before. But our expectation is to close that in the second part of this year.\nMatt Ginter: And Abhi, this is Matt. To be clear, just as we said last quarter, we have not yet factored in any financial impact from Avery into our guidance. It is not in those numbers yet.\nAbhiram Rajendran: Okay. Great. And then just a quick follow-up, just a general M&A question. Could you talk a little bit about the health of the M&A pipeline overall, as well as which businesses are the primary areas of focus for potential add-ons through the course of the year?\nDavid W. Meline: Sure. Yes. So if you look at the pipeline right now, it looks very similar and healthy compared to where we've been over the last couple of years, at least. We've announced a couple of transactions thus far here in the first quarter, the one being the Avery and the other one being this CodeRyte business that we are bolting on to the health information systems business, which we think is a very good opportunity for us. And we foresee, going forward, a combination of acquisitions that have good growth characteristics, as well as from time to time, doing transactions that give us scale and leverage similar to Avery. So as you might know, we look across the business. We look for opportunities where we can fill in gaps in existing businesses or adjacencies that we think we can bring our own capabilities to bear, whether that be our global reach or whether that be technology combinations that we can really drive businesses with.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Terry Darling of Goldman Sachs.\nTerry Darling: Inge, I'm wondering if you could -- just following up on Deane's line of questioning about potential changes in the formula under your leadership. I'm wondering if you might address the idea that a lot of companies, not just multi-industry companies, but a lot of companies use divestitures of slower-growing businesses over time as a way to reinvest in higher-growing businesses. That hasn't been a big part of the 3M formula historically. I'm wondering if you're considering a change in that regard.\nInge G. Thulin: Well, I would say that, as you know, that both relative to organization and relative to businesses, it's always an evolution as you go. And first of all, as I said earlier, my initial focus here, together with the team, is to deliver this year plan. As we go into the strategic planning season in the middle of the year, I'm sure that as we always do, we will have those type of discussions in terms of performance of businesses, where [ph] they fit into our overall direction as we move ahead and make those calls. But it's not top of mind on my agenda at this point in time. As I said, very focused on this year, and then we will evaluate it as we go. I see it that we have a broad-base business opportunity for us with 6 businesses, and the way we are spreading ourself geographically with execution capabilities. So at this point in time, it's not top of mind of me. Top of mind for me is to deliver this year plan.\nTerry Darling: Okay. And then Dave, I'm wondering if you might be able to calibrate the organic volume assumption for the year up 2 to 5, first quarter close to flat. Maybe a little color around how the full year expectations may have changed for the various segments relative to the 2 to 5 and how you're seeing the second quarter within that range.\nDavid W. Meline: Sure. So first of all, if you look at the full year expectations by segment, right now, we continue to believe that the ranges that we set out are still very good. So we don't see any change in terms of the prospects for growth across those segments. If you might recall, we had the highest expectations for growth for the year around our industrial-oriented businesses, that being Industrial and Transportation and Safety and Security. That continues to be our view. And the toughest segments, obviously, D&G and the Electronics business, again, we don't see any change. We had 0 to 5 for the year on Electronics and a negative growth rate on D&G. And we think that's going to be the case. What is also true, as you work through the year, second quarter we think will continue to be relatively modest in terms of the growth opportunities. And then we're expecting a pickup in the second half still, which is a combination of improving trends, for example, in the Electronics business, as well as the fact that the comps get easier for us as we work through the year.\nTerry Darling: Okay. And then just lastly on the cost-cutting narrative, Dave, that you've talked about in the past, you had SG&A pretty much flat on a year-over-year basis and there was an indication that you would modulate that as you move through 2012 based on how you saw the growth and risk around the business. Sounds like you're seeing things pretty much spot on. So cost cutting, essentially, the same message as we had before, not stepping that up, not stepping that down to fund additional growth. Maybe just refresh us there.\nDavid W. Meline: Yes. No, that's -- I think you put it well, which is, if you look now, kind of looking back at Q1, we feel very good about what we were able to achieve here. And we also feel very good about our ability to deliver for the year having got off with quite reasonable results despite pretty weak growth. So we'll continue to run with that posture here into the second quarter and looking for that growth upturn, which is yet to be validated. So we're going to be pretty careful in terms of how we're managing on the cost side in the near term. But again, as both Inge and I have mentioned, we do need to be very clear and continue to focus on where we're investing for the future because we need to get the right balance there. And we have the capability to do that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.\nJeffrey T. Sprague: To David's point, you guys are off to a good start. But, Inge, your comment that the focus is really to execute on this year's plan. I mean, obviously, you don't have control of the end markets. What, in your view, is kind of the biggest challenge, if you will, as you think about the remainder of the year? Is there execution within a certain division you're focused on? Is it cost? Is it restructuring? What, if anything, is really kind of taking the majority of your attention here near term?\nInge G. Thulin: Well, first of all, it's important for us to see growth coming. And as you know, one of the challenge is, which is not a 3M challenge by definition, is the global economy. So, of course, Asia, with China being slower than we have seen before and Japan, also, has a recovery that is slightly slower than people expected. And then you have West Europe. So I think those are the 3 things that is top of mind for me that I would like to see us coming back and materialize the growth that we've laid out in the plan. I think that's important. Now if you think about China for a second, we talked about that on the last call, there were 3 things that impacted China growth. One was domestic growth due to government management of spending there. It is export to West Europe, and it's electronics. We said at that time, and we still believe it's correct, that export to West Europe will probably not come back this year. But we see an uptick in electronics, and we also see a slight uptick on the domestic market there. So our business, in fact, last quarter or this quarter, Q1, we had a 20% sequential growth versus Q4, and it was an all-time high in China, meaning our base business grew 8%-plus, our Infrastructure business was flat and the Electronic business was down around 16%. But as I said, as we see the semiconductor business type of -- get a pickup in terms of utilization in factories, we believe that will come back. So I think that's -- we see that coming. That's a big point. That's my biggest concern at this point in time. I think in West Europe, that, that have stabilized, but at a lower level. And we have a very good business model and a very mature team in place there. I think we will be able to deliver the plan. But still, I hope that we can capitalize and take some market shares there. So I think it's very much to make sure we continue a very controlled management relative to our investment. Let out some of them, as we talked about, in oil and gas and mining, aerospace, emerging market specifically for Health Care and for Personal Protection. And when we see that coming and Electronics start to pick up and we see them materializing in terms of real growth midyear, then I think we are -- I see more positive on the outlook. But I just would like to make sure that I see it before we move forward full time.\nJeffrey T. Sprague: That's good color. And just a little more on China, if you could. How different from normal sequential patterns was that lift from Q4 to Q1 that you saw with...\nInge G. Thulin: Very similar. Very similar to the past in terms of the sequential. And we see Q2 still be tougher in China. But then as we go in the second part of the year, I call it, to the plan, we will start to see the growth coming. So very similar, that's the answer to your question. But the good sign, I think the good sign, all-time high in terms of growth in China first quarter was -- which I personally see very positive.\nJeffrey T. Sprague: Right. And then just on Optical. Can you give us where your plug-in versus battery mix is now?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes. So in the first quarter, as you might recall, we exited the year, fourth quarter, battery was 58% of the sales of the Optical Systems division, so that being handheld devices in particular. In the first quarter, we were a little higher than that. It was, I think, 64%. So we had said about 2/3 of the sales this year we expected to be battery and 1/3 plug-in. And it looks very much in line, what we're seeing in Optical division to that plan. And likewise, very tough comp in the first quarter, not a surprise to us, the result here. And we expect to be up modestly, sequentially, on Optical Systems. But still on a year-over-year in Q2, it'll be down quite substantially again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura Capital.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Can I just get a little more clarification on that China comment in terms of, as you said, still tough in 2Q, but yet you've got this sequential recovery in 1Q. Do you mean that it -- I mean, does the sequential recovery continue into 2Q and you're just at a tough year-over-year spot? Can you just maybe give us what you're looking for on a year-over-year basis for those quarters?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes. So as Inge said, the sequential performance we saw in Q1 was typical of past performance, which gave us some comfort that we're not seeing a further decline. So as you might recall, in the second half of last year, x Electronics, we were running now in around high-single digits to low-double-digit growth. We expect, then, as we move through the year in China, that we will see modest sequential growth on an absolute revenue basis continuing through the year. And therefore, on a year-over-year comp basis, that'll be a rising percentage comp as we move through the year.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Okay. And so far, it sounds like the Electronics side of things is where you've seen the pickup. I mean, have you seen anything on, I guess, more of the industrial business or the infrastructure-related businesses? Can you maybe break it by the pieces?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes. So Electronics, sequentially, was up. But if you look on a year-over-year basis, not yet. So it was following a typical seasonal pattern. Industrial was modestly growing, but at a similar level to what we saw in the second half of last year, and infrastructure as well. So really, no big changes in terms of the individual segments in the first quarter.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Okay. And just on the $30 million to $50 million of increased investment, is that just going to kind of spread evenly now? Or are you going to do it all at once? How does that kind of flow out?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes. So that you can expect will spread through the year. What we're doing is, in a number of cases, we were managing very tightly spending. And so to some extent, we're loosening up on that as we see specific areas where we have opportunities. In others, we're taking the opportunity to devote more focus in resources such as these couple of divisions that Inge talked about. So I think fair to say, you can think about that being timed throughout the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts of Buckingham Research.\nJohn E. Roberts: Inge, on Slide 9, you indicated Japan along with the other areas that were slow. Don't you have pretty easy comps in Japan right now against the earthquake impacted year-ago results?\nInge G. Thulin: I think we will start to see that in the second quarter. And that's, I think, that's where you will see the comparison becoming a little bit easier. So when I talk about it, it is to say that it take a little bit longer time for the investment back in Japan in the country in order to recover. And I think, as we have a broad-based business there, which in fact is one of our biggest subsidiaries in the world, as you know, take us a little bit longer time to see the growth coming as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.\nNigel Coe: So David, you mentioned that you still feel pretty good about the full year guidance by segment. But can you maybe just spin back to 1Q, and which businesses saw -- geographic areas exceeded your plan, your internal plan? Obviously, you don't publish guidance, but internally, which businesses came in stronger?\nDavid W. Meline: If I think about it by segment in the first quarter, what I would say, Nigel, is actually -- you look at it, first of all, 0 growth on an organic basis is nothing that we get too excited about at all. But if you walk through the segments, again, we are pleased with the momentum we continue to see in the industrial-related businesses. I mean, you look at Industrial and Transportation, both good growth, around 9%, and a quite a substantial margin pickup to 22.5%. If you look at Safety and Security business, again, good growth, 5.5% and a nice margin pickup, including sequentially. So we feel good about those businesses continuing to run. But of course, we had them pegged for the highest growth through the year. If you think about Health Care and Consumer, I would say very much in line with what we expected here in the first part of the year. Consumer retail is -- in the mature markets, in particular, continues to be quite soft, although we were pleased with our own performance in the U.S., which was indicating some pickup of share. And certainly, in the case of Health Care, with the exception of the Drug Delivery business, all of those businesses ran quite nicely in mid-single digits to double digits in the case of health information systems. So tougher environment for those couple of businesses. Both performed in terms of managing the margin and growth question. And then finally, Electronics segments, including Display and Graphics and Electro and Communications, were very much in line. I mean, very, very much in line with what we were expecting. And as we've discussed, we continue to expect to see that recovery develop. And there are some indications, such as in semiconductor that, that's on the horizon.\nInge G. Thulin: This is Inge. And one thing to add to that is also our performance in Latin America, that is very strong. And this has been going on for multiple years now and, yes, continuing. And that's a very, very good sign for us. It's a part of the world where our brand equity is very high. We have a incredible, solid organization there that is both able to execute with [ph] operational excellence and are able to grow in most segments that we are in there. So we're very, very pleased with Latin America. And as I said earlier, there will be some additional investment there to some businesses. But we are very, very pleased with them. And I would just like to highlight that in addition to what David said as well.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Great. And then Inge, on your comment about that you feel more confident in the growth environment or maybe the 2012 plan. Can you maybe just go through how you think in terms of managing discretionary costs versus growth investments? And are we now in a slightly more of a bias towards growth investments versus discretionary cost management? And does that mean that maybe we've got a bias towards a higher revenue number and perhaps a slightly lower margin number?\nInge G. Thulin: Well, it's not either/or. It's always a balance, as you know. And I'm not there yet to say that I'm confident that the growth is on the bag. So that's why we're holding also the $6.50 on the top of our guidance range because we would like to see it really coming through. But as I said, we are letting out for the year here. As a first step, $30 million to $50 million in very targeted investment for growth. And that's the starting point for us. And as I said, it's not either/or. We are committed to the commitment to you, and that's what we would deliver. But I think the areas that we now have identified for additional investment based on the platforms we have and the presence, and specifically around global customers, plays very well for us. So the businesses we talked about earlier, which is aerospace, oil and gas and mining, et cetera, the global customers, and we can serve them very well, and not only with solution from a technology perspective, but also with a geographical reach as we have subsidiaries all over the world. So this is a perfect space for us, but we're rolling it out carefully. And I would like to see growth materialize and feel more confident before we make a even bigger investment.\nNigel Coe: Okay. And then quickly, David, do you have the book-to-bill ratio for Electro this quarter?\nDavid W. Meline: Could you repeat that?\nNigel Coe: Do you have the book-to-bill ratio for Electro, the Electro segment?\nDavid W. Meline: We don't, in fact.\nMatt Ginter: Yes. That's not a number we monitor, Nigel, book-to-bill explicitly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.\nCharles  Stephen Tusa: So can you just help me reconcile how -- the leverage, obviously, this quarter was phenomenal. Maybe that was price cost. But you guys have said pretty consistently that your emerging markets or Asia business has -- is kind of accretive to margins, yet this seemed to be more of a developed markets kind of quarter. So is it just that price cost dynamic that's throwing that off? Or -- I'm just trying to kind of reconcile those comments.\nDavid W. Meline: Sure. Yes. So what I would say, Steve, first of all, is we did see very good performance not only in the mature markets -- for example, in the U.S., we're up over 1 point in margin. But also developing markets continue to deliver on margin despite what was a weaker growth environment. So we don't see any big shift as between kind of those sources of income for the business right now because we've been managing into what we expected to be a softer growth environment. And that's true, really, across the globe for us and across our businesses. And I think as you look at the margins, certainly, as you can see it by sector, and I would tell you that's not dissimilar geographically to what we traditionally deliver on.\nCharles  Stephen Tusa: And then just on Health Care, another blowout margin there. Can you maybe get into what was the key driver of that margin number and then how do we think about that margin going forward? You guys have said it's high 20s. You're now kind of comfortably above 30. Maybe talk about that.\nDavid W. Meline: Yes. Yes, what I would say is, what particularly was encouraging for us is the factories are really running efficiently right now in Health Care, which had a material contribution to the margin this quarter. We've also been able to offset what were raw material cost increases that came through, particularly last year. And then finally, we've been continuing to invest to grow that business. And typically, with the increasing product portfolio, that enables us to hold and to increase margin over time. And we're encouraged by the results of those investment efforts that are also, we believe, coming through to the results.\nCharles  Stephen Tusa: What's your most favorable division there, from a profitability perspective?\nDavid W. Meline: Well, honestly, they're all very, very strong businesses.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.\nLaurence Alexander: So 2 quick questions. Can you parse the growth that you're seeing in Latin America and the trends that you're seeing in terms of how much is underlying demand versus market share gains? And then on the CNG agreement with Chesapeake, if you look out 5, 6 years, what kind of market opportunity or size business could this be for 3M?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes. So in terms of Latin America, the growth that we saw, it was actually very impressive. So if you look at across our 6 business sectors, with the exception of one that was -- ran at 9% growth, the others all had double-digit growth in the first quarter. So it was a very broad-based growth pattern we saw in Latin America, which is nothing new for us, and obviously quite encouraging as we look across our businesses. So answer is, in fact, yes, we're picking up share across those businesses. As Latin America, while economic growth was reasonable, certainly in particular in Brazil, if you look at the data, it looked quite weak in the first quarter, and frankly, we had some concerns going into the year. But the team did a really nice job in our biggest markets, Brazil and Mexico. And also importantly, the smaller markets, the guys have done a great job across the business.\nMatt Ginter: Laurence, your second question didn't come through. What was that?\nLaurence Alexander: So on the compressed natural gas announcement with Chesapeake, if you looked out at 5, 7 years, what you think the possible business size could be for 3M?\nDavid W. Meline: Yes. We actually haven't put a number on it, Laurence. The guys are really excited, because if you look at the nature of these CNG containers that we're partnering with them on, we think it's a very significant opportunity for the company. But to be honest, we haven't put a number on it yet.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.\nMatt Ginter: Good. Well, thanks for joining us this morning. The questions were very good. We appreciate your spending time with us, and we'll look forward to talking here as the next quarter progresses. So bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your line."}], "2014": [{"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 4, "year": 2013, "date": "2014-01-30 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M Fourth Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) It is recommended that you use a landline phone if you\u2019re going to register for a question. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, January 29, 2014. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nMatt Ginter: Thank you and good morning everyone. On today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2013 performance along with the 2014 outlook. Inge and David will make some opening comments and we will leave plenty of time for your questions. Let me mention a few upcoming dates and events. First, our 2014 earnings conference calls are set for April 24th, July 14th and October 23rd. Also, we\u2019ll host an investor meeting on the morning of Tuesday, December 16. I know that calendar is filled quickly, please hold these dates. More details will be available later this year. Note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying the call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 2. During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to Slide 3 and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Inge Thulin, 3M\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Matt and good morning everyone. I appreciate you joining us for the call today. For 3M, 2013 was a very successful year. Our team did an excellent job of bringing our vision and strategy to life and increasing 3M\u2019s relevance to customers around the world. We delivered a strong performance and importantly, we advanced the company through the three key strategic levels, portfolio management, investment in research and development and business transformation. Let me give you a bit more on each of these key levels. In 2013, portfolio management remained at the front of how we managed 3M. For example, we combined and scaled businesses in electronics and energy to better serve our customers, gain rapid cost synergies and address underperforming businesses. We took similar actions in Safety and Graphics to enhance our product offerings and improved our relevance to customers. And when it made sense, we exited as we did with the fly-fishing business within the consumer business group. We continued to build strength on strengths by investing in research and development, which is the heartbeat of our plan. Our increased investment is focused on long term disruptive technologies aimed at opportunities with significant growth potential. We made good progress with business transformation enabled by our global ERP implementation. We rolled out in several countries in 2013 as we moved forward into the deployment phase. This effort will help us to create a more efficient and productive 3M. Our teams are building on the experiences from the initial rollouts in order to improve our capabilities to deploy going forward. Overall very good execution by our team in these strategic levels. At our investor meeting in December, we announced plans to better optimize our capital structure. These plans will reduce our total cost of capital, allow us to further expand the company and enable even higher returns to our shareholders. Organic growth remains key to our plans, so we will continue to invest in CapEx and research development. And we are planning to invest $5 billion to $10 billion in acquisitions through 2017 with more possible given the right strategic opportunity. We also announced in December a 35% increase of our first quarter 2014 dividend along with a stronger commitment to share repurchases. Over the 2013 to 2017 planning period, we expect per share repurchases of $17 billion to $22 billion this is a prior expected range of $7.5 billion to $15 billion. This more aggressive deployment of capital reflects the strength of our business model and our confidence in 3M\u2019s future. Now I will review financial highlights from 2013. Please turn to slide four. For the year sales were nearly $31 billion, up 3.2% in dollar terms. Organic local currency growth was 3.4% led by Health Care and Industrial at 5% and Safety and Graphics at 4%. Geographically, we posted positive organic growth in all regions. Latin America/Canada led away with organic growth of 7%, Asia-Pacific growth 4%, United States was up 3% and Europe/Middle East/Africa was up 2%. Currency impacts reduced worldwide sales by 1.6% and acquisitions added 1.4% to sales growth for the year. Operating margins remained strong at 21.6% or 21.9%, excluding acquisitions. Four of our five business groups delivered margins above 21%, evidence of continued broad based effectiveness and efficiency. Earnings were $6.72 per share, up 6.3% year-over-year. We returned a record $6.9 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Finally, free cash flow conversion was 89% with return on invested capital at 20%. Overall, I'm very pleased with our 2013 results. We delivered good broad based performance while investing and building for long-term success. Let me now review the outlook, please turn to slide five. We described our 2014 planning estimates in detail at our December Investor Meeting and we are maintaining those estimates today. We expect 2014 earnings per share in the range of $7.30 to $7.55 and organic local currency growth of plus 3% to plus 6%. Foreign currency translation is expected to be neutral to minus 1% and we anticipate the tax rate of 28% to 29% with free cash flow conversion of 90% to 100%. I will now turn the call over to David Meline for the detail on the fourth quarter results. David?\nDavid Meline: Thank you, Inge. I will begin by reviewing the fourth quarter sales growth. Please turn to slide #6. Organic local currency growth was 3.4% in the fourth quarter, including organic volume growth of 2% and selling price increases of 1.4%. Price increases have been positive in 2013 for a couple of reasons. First, investment in research and development continues to support a strong price value equation in many of the markets that we serve. And second, we adjust selling prices to offset currency devaluations in certain developing countries, which has been the case in 2013. Acquisitions added 0.7 points to sales growth in the quarter, all due to Ceradyne in our Industrial Business group. We acquired Ceradyne in late November of 2012, so we are now passed the one-year mark and beginning with December reporting, we no longer report Ceradyne sales as acquisitions. Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 1.7 percentage points in the fourth quarter. Currency impacts were negative 6% in Latin America/Canada and negative 5% in Asia-Pacific, while EMEA had a positive 3% currency impact year-on-year. On the total U.S. dollar basis, sales rose 2.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2012. Looking geographically, local currency sales growth was 4.5% in the United States, the highest of any region during the quarter. All business groups grew organically in the U.S., with particular strength in Industrial and in Safety and Graphics. Organic sales growth in EMEA was 3.4% in the fourth quarter, West Europe in particular grew by 3%, continuing the positive trends we have seen in recent quarters. In Germany the largest of our West Europe subsidiaries grew a solid 8% per organically. All businesses posted positive organic growth in the EMEA lead by Industrial. Asia Pacific grew 3.3% organically in the fourth quarter with consumer, Health Care and Safety and Graphics leading the way. Industrial also posted positive organic growth in the fourth quarter within APAC and Electronics and Energy grew just slightly. Japan continued to grow nicely with 4% organic growth year on year. China, Hong Kong grew 1% organically versus a tough prior year comp off 16% plus in the fourth quarter of 2012. Excluding electronics China, Hong Kong grew more than 6% organically in Q4. Organic local currency sales growth was 2.2% in Latin America, Canada during the fourth quarter which was below recent trend levels for a few reasons. One, we saw some slowing in government tenders for infrastructure projects in certain countries which impacted sales in our Electronics and Energy business. Consumer was also soft in Q4 due to weak retail demand and challenging year-on-year accounts and lastly sales in Venezuela declined year-on-year due to economic and the political situation there. Venezuela diluted fourth quarter organic growth in Latin America, Canada by 1.5 percentage points and we continue to work towards minimizing our (inaudible) exposure in any associated cost. Organic local currency growth was 4% across all developing markets and 3% in developed markets. Let\u2019s turn to Slide number 7 for a discussion of the fourth quarter income statement. Sales for the fourth quarter were $7.6 billion, an increase of 2.4% in dollar terms. Gross profit rose 5.8% to $3.6 billion and gross margins rose by a solid 1.5 percentage point to 47.5%. SG&A spending increased in line with sales growth and R&D as a percent of sales rose by 10 basis points to 5.8%. Operating income increased nearly 10% versus the fourth quarter of 2012. GAAP operating margins were 20.9%, up 140 basis points year-on-year. Organic volume growth at 20 basis points margins and the combination of lower raw material cost and higher selling prices contribute a positive 160 basis points year-on-year. Fourth quarter margins improved year-on-year in a recently acquired Ceradyne business which added 30 basis points to total company operating margins in Q4. We expect further margin improvement in 2014 for this business. Strategic investments, reduced margins by 70 basis points year on year, this represents incremental investments in disruption R&D, ERP and various restructuring actions. Lower year-on-year pension and OPEB expenses boosted fourth quarter margins by 30 basis points while foreign exchange impacts reduced margins by 40 basis points. Fourth quarter earnings increased 15% to $1.62 per share. Average diluted shares outstanding declined 3% year-on-year which added $0.05 to EPS and currency impacts hurt fourth quarter earnings per share by approximately $0.04. The fourth quarter concluded a good year for the company and the 3M team is energized and confident as we begin 2014. Now let\u2019s turn to cash flow. Please turn to Slide number 8. We generated $2 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, up $255 million versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Higher net income and lower pension contributions were the primary drivers of this improvement. Capital expenditures were $543 million, an increase of $36 million. Looking ahead to 2014, we continue to expect full year CapEx will be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. Fourth quarter free cash flow was $1.5 billion, up $219 million year-on-year and we converted 131% of net income to cash versus 124% in last year's comparable quarter. For the full year 2013, free cash flow was $4.2 billion and conversion was 89%. We paid $423 million in cash dividends during the quarter or $1.7 billion year-to-date. And as Inge mentioned, in December we announced a 35% increase in the first quarter 2014 dividend. Gross share repurchases were $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter and $5.2 billion for the full year. For 2014, we expect full year gross share repurchases will be in the range of $3 billion to $5 billion. In total, we returned $2.1 billion in cash to shareholders in the fourth quarter or $6.9 billion for the full year, both at all-time record levels for 3M. Net debt at year end 2013 increased $900 million year-on-year and $300 million sequentially. As I mentioned at our December investor meeting, we expect to add leverage of $2 billion to $4 billion in 2014, as we continue to improve the efficiency of our capital structure. During the fourth quarter, 3M issued an 8th-year Eurobond yielding less than 2%. The face amount was \u20ac600 million or $815 million. Let's now review our fourth quarter performance on a business-by-business basis. Please go to Slide #9. Our Industrial business have another strong quarter with sales of $2.6 billion and 6% organic local currency growth. Our advanced materials and automotive OEM businesses generated double-digit organic growth and we also posted good growth in 3M Purification, aerospace and automotive aftermarket. Organic local currency sales increased in all geographic regions led by the U.S. at 8%, EMEA grew 6% in Q4, including more than 10% in Germany. Organic growth was 3% in both Asia Pacific and in Latin American/Canada. The Ceradyne acquisition added 2% to Industrial growth in the quarter. Fourth quarter operating income was $553 million, up 14% year-on-year and operating margins increased 150 basis points to 21.5%. Volume leverage, positive selling prices and good productivity contributed to the improvement. Our Industrial business had an outstanding year in 2013. Organic sales growth accelerated in the second half of the year versus the first and sales exceeded $10 billion for the first time ever. Nice performance by the Industrial team. Please turn to Slide #10. Our Health Care business generated sales of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Sales rose 4% in organic local currency terms with the strongest growth in health information systems, food safety and critical and chronic care. Drug delivery systems declined in the quarter. All geographic regions generated positive organic local currency sales growth with Asia Pacific up 6%, Latin America/Canada up 5% and EMEA and the U.S. each up 3% in the quarter. In developing markets, Health Care grew 10% organically in the fourth quarter. This has been an area of strategic investment priority for some time and we are encouraged to see consistently strong organic growth as a result. Fourth quarter operating income in Health Care was $425 million. Operating margins were 31.2%, which was very much in line with full year. Fourth quarter margins were down a point year-on-year against a strong comp in Q4 2012. The recently enacted U.S. medical device tax was a contributing factor. Please go to Slide #11, Safety and Graphics had a solid fourth quarter with 5% organic local currency sales growth and 16% growth in operating income. Organic growth was broad based with nearly all businesses posting positive growth. Personal safety by far, our largest business within Safety and Graphics generated high single-digit organic growth in Q4. We also posted good growth in roofing granules, commercial graphics and architectural markets. Sales in Safety and Graphics grew organically in all major geographic regions with Latin America/Canada up 8%, Asia Pacific and the US up 6% and EMEA up 1%. Operating income increased 16% to $256 million and margins rose 2.2 percentage points to 19.1%. Profits benefited from volume leverage, price performance and solid productivity. Now let's look at Electronics and Energy found on Slide 12. Fourth quarter sales in this business were $1.3 billion, up 0.4% in organic local currency terms and operating income rose 1% to $221 million. Margins were 16.7% up 40 basis points versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter. I mentioned in our October earnings call that we expected sales and earnings for electronics and energy to be very close to last year\u2019s levels and in fact that is what happened. Electronics related sales declined 2% on an organic local currency basis with positive growth in optical films offset by declines in other businesses. In our energy related businesses, sales increased 2% organically, led by our electrical markets and renewable energy businesses. On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales increased 2% in EMEA and United States, Asia Pacific grew slightly and Latin America/Canada was down year-on-year. Despite challenging end market conditions, the electronic and energy team executed very well in 2013. Second half organic growth rates were stronger than the first as were operating margins. It was a good result in the tough market. Finally, let's review the Consumer business found on Slide number 13. Sales on the consumer business group were $1.1 billion with organic local currency growth of 1.3%. Recall that in the fourth quarter of 2012 consumer generated 9% organic local currency growth, so the comp here was quite challenging. Organic sales growth was strongest in our consumer Health Care and home care businesses and we also had a positive organic growth in DIY. Sales declined slightly in stationary and office supplies impacted by continued consolidation trends in the office retail and also market. On the positive side, we recently launched a new line of command and ease of products for outdoor use which contributed nicely to fourth quarter growth. The US retail shopping season is an important factor for the consumer business and we would characterize this year\u2019s season is okay but not strong. Fewer shopping days due to the late Thanksgiving holiday were a factor for most major US retailers and for their suppliers. On a geographic basis, sales in organic local currencies increased 9% in Asia Pacific and rose slightly in both the US and EMEA, Latin America/Canada declined 6% year-on-year. Operating income was $226 million with operating margins of 20.4%. That concludes my comments regarding 3M\u2019s fourth quarter business results. I\u2019ll turn now the call back to Inge.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, David. To summarize, Q4 was a strong finish to a very successful year for 3M. In 2013 we received good growth and solid profitability while advancing our strategic initiatives in investments. Perhaps most importantly, we came out of 2013 stronger than we ever at with both sales and earnings growth accelerating in the second half of the year, this was the first. 2013 results provided further proof that our strategies are gaining traction and driving our performance to higher levels. I can think of numerous example that illustrate is but I will highlight just a couple. Let's start with our $1.4 billion automotive OEM business which in 2013 grew over 7% organically more than twice the rate of global auto production. We see this result through improved customer relevance, leveraging 3M\u2019s vast technology capability to solve problems for this important group of OEM customers. This business grew significantly in Q4 in developing markets like China, Mexico and Indonesia by offering relevant solutions to these rapidly growing markets. Another example is our safety and graphic business group. We saw margins expand by more than two points in the fourth quarter. This improvement is due to cost through several recent portfolio actions, which have resulted in improved customer relevance, greater scale and reduce costs. We also saw improved profitability on recent acquisitions in this business. These are two powerful examples of many that illustrate how the strategies are pushing 3M\u2019s performance through new level. In closing, I want to recognize the people of 3M for their many contributions that continued our success as a company. We have great confidence and good momentum as we enter 2014. Our teams are focused on executing our plan and creating even greater value for customers and our shareholders. Thank you for your attention this morning and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie: Thank you and good morning, everyone.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: So my first question is really on the organic growth trajectory. It seems like you are exiting the year pretty strongly in Industrial and in Safety and Graphics, but still some weakness there in electronics and energy. And so I was wondering if you could just provide some context and color, as it relates to the guidance that you have for 2014 because the ranges across your segments tend to be pretty consistent. And so whether you have more or less confidence in any of the segments as you're building into 2014?\nInge Thulin: Well, first of all, we hold our guidance of 3 to 6 for the year and you are right. We are coming out strong of the year, right. So if we look upon our performance in between Q3 and Q4 and add that together for the second part of the year, we had a very good second part of the year. So we feel good about that. In terms of the businesses, you can see that we have had very good tick up in Industrial as of lately and we feel very confident of that business and that range, which is 3 to 6. The same for Health Care, Health Care is continuing to grow well for us and specifically as you\u2019ve have seen in developing economies. And again, we had in this quarter a 10% growth in that part of the world. And we have a very strong platform in the developed world, right. So we feel confident around that. I will say the auto businesses are right in the middle of the range. We don\u2019t see any indication at this point in time of going outside the range. Again, as we know electronics and energy is very much based in the electronic space based on the market, right. And as you know that is what we are following. And if there is a little bit slower that will impact us, of course but it can turnaround relatively fast. So from that perspective, the 2 to 6 guidance we have, we feel confident with that, so no change at this point in time.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful color. And I guess my follow-up question is really --\nInge Thulin: The 2 to 6 range is for electronics and energy, it is 3 to 6.\nJoe Ritchie: That\u2019s all right. That\u2019s right. I guess my follow-up question is really for David. I know that you haven\u2019t made any changes to guidance. Over at the Outlook Meeting, you provided us with a 2014 earnings bridge. I was wondering if there were any changes to any of the sub buckets and specifically perhaps you can provide some color on the pension number, which is a pretty wide range at $0.10 to $0.20?\nDavid Meline: Sure. So if you look at our earnings bridge, the answer would be right now, we don\u2019t see any changes to the bridge of the elements. If you were to think about where we are monitoring at the top or the bottom in those ranges, first, on pension, we come in now with a confirmed year-over-year decrease in expense of $150 million for $0.15 a share. So right in the middle of that range we've provided. And what I would say right now is the other area that we\u2019re monitoring, we said zero to five on foreign exchange. And if there is anything that if I marked that market today, it would be certainly towards the lower end of that price and headwind versus the range right now versus as we saw a couple of months ago. So otherwise we think we\u2019re looking fine in terms of the other elements.\nInge Thulin: And just to clarify that the lower-end of the range do you think the FX headwind is going be close to zero?\nDavid Meline: Closer to $0.05.\nInge Thulin: Closer to five, okay great I'll get back to you thanks guys.\nDavid Meline: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Hi good morning guys.\nDavid Meline: Good morning, Davis.\nScott Davis: Congrats on a good 2013. Inge, you mentioned M&A in your prepared remarks and if you talk through, you put out a pretty big prefix number as a target of potential deals. I mean can you talk through your confidence and also maybe the timing, the types of things you're looking at, obviously you can\u2019t name names. But I think if I look back the years of 3M it's been hard there, really there hasn't been a lot of consistency to the three -- to the R&D effort. I\u2019m sorry to the M&A effort so it just gives a little sense of what's what you're looking out there.\nInge Thulin: First of all, as you know, we have been working for the last 18 months to clarify the position of our business relative to our portfolio. And I think that\u2019s an important starting point relative to understanding of where we try to go. So the thing about Heartland and push forward of course, places for us that are interesting in order to build up, not only in terms of research and development, but potential acquisitions. So I think if you think about it from that perceptive, we would like to look upon businesses that will either strengthen a very strong position for the Heartland divisions and/or accelerate growth and push forward. So by definition, we\u2019re looking for many elements as you know relative to acquisition candidates but think about it in those categories. Now that can always be an exception to the rule and if you have businesses where we really need to boost up our performance or build out and be more relevance we will do that as well. And I think if you go back and think about the efforts take that we did, we're seeing through the traffic safety system, but by definition not these either Heartland will push forward, but what's important for us to make that acquisition in order to build out a relevance in that market. And so that\u2019s the way you think about it in that way versus think about this business group right. We are -- we are interested everywhere, but I think it's from the market perspective in order to move the company forward. Now the pipeline is good for us, we have, as I said, we have laid on a little bit of, we\u2019ve always had a process of bottom-up. We have type of laid on a top down approach as well in order to make sure that we do not miss out on potentials that go across business groups in terms of potential. And where we talked about size of the potential acquisitions, I think there is a couple of things, we had build up now a very competent group relative to integration because one of the thing that is important for us is to integrate acquisitions as fast as possible and get the benefit for you and for us in terms of return of the investment. And now we will not go crazy if it doesn\u2019t -- we have done acquisitions in the past has that been on very small or to mid-size and we will really evaluate huge, huge acquisitions in terms of strategic importance. So I think you will see acquisitions in mid-range as well as we go ahead here. In terms of timing as you know it's very difficult to comment on timing this is really in some cases will take some time and we are very careful as we do this as you know.\nScott Davis: Okay. That's helpful. And then, just as a follow up, obviously 3M is focused on R&D has been important and goes back a long ways, but something seems to have changed since you\u2019ve taken over Inge. It seems like the R&D focus may have made the yielding more results if you just look across where the growth rates have been higher, it's been generally the more, I would say R&D intensive businesses has been outgrowing in market the most? I mean, what have you specifically changed that yielded that acceleration in new products?\nInge Thulin: Well, first of all, this is not about me. This is about a very dedicated 3M team. So, its not about me, it\u2019s a credit should go to the business groups and the divisions and the subsidiaries. But I think that, what I am doing, I've encouraged them really to make sure that they understand the business model in terms of us be able to create more value for our customers, because that is to help it for us in terms of making sure that we maintain an eventually improved margins and the return on the business. So, I think it\u2019s, that reduce up with, the whole way up to me relative to how we are doing and also try to encourage to help them if there is some project that is may be more difficult for them to pull off based on the current situation. So there is a little bit piece of running a business with glasses on with one microscope on one side and a telescope on the other side of the glasses, right, and I think that\u2019s important for us to do. So, we feel good about it, we are very committed to research and development. It is by definition revalue create to 3M and if you think about it, we are in terms of the technologies, we are a creator and builder of technologies and we also user. But in addition to that, other company can use the technologies. So that\u2019s the difference for us. We create and we develop the technologies and in many cases we are using it. But other companies, we can help them a lot for them to be more competitive by using our technologies and that is the strength of 3M.\nScott Davis: Okay. I did a lot of job asking the question. I think what I was meaning to say is, have you made any change it all from focusing the efforts on undisrupted technologies versus extensions?\nInge Thulin: Yes. We have and that additional, when we tried to go from historically 5.5 closer to 6 and you saw we made a small improvement on that, specifically this quarter we moved again, that additional investment is all into disrupted technologies for the future. So that\u2019s an important. Thank you for that question. It\u2019s a very important piece.\nScott Davis: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nDavid Meline: Thanks Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin: Hi, guys. Good morning, guys.\nInge Thulin: Good morning Andrew.\nDavid Meline: Good morning.\nAndrew Obin: Hi. Just to dig in a little bit into what's happening in the emerging markets that I guess specifically in South America, it would be -- went from being the fastest growth market to the lowest growth market? How much of a surprise was it what happened in that quarter and how are you sort of monitoring the developments there to make sure that its stays under control?\nInge Thulin: Let me start on the front end of the business. First of all, there was a slight slowdown in the economies down there and we saw that, as David said, in his speech here earlier was specifically around consumer confidence that impacted our consumer business. And that was very much on, I would say, government related businesses, specifically into utility businesses, where we have the strong precision. So I think that and that was broad base for us, so the economy slowed and as you know there is big business around mining in that part of the world. So that impacted us and I would say, I don\u2019t know, you would be always be a little bit surprised when you are not growing as fast as in the past because you will do that. But, generally speaking, we had a good feeling of what is happening in that part of world. In terms of risk as we talked about in Venezuela, it\u2019s -- David will make some comments here relative how we are all manage and monitoring that.\nDavid Meline: Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. So, I think, picking up on Inge\u2019s comment, if you think about the guidance we provided in December. We indicated we think that this year we will grow 8% to 11% in the region. So little bit off of where we have been in the last of couple of years but still elevated and I would say today as we look at that, probably we are thinking about it more along the lines of the low end of that range of 8% to 11%. And specifically it relates to what Inge has said, we got some sectors which we saw some slowing, we don\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s going to remain slow all through \u201914, but we have to take that into account. And then, I think, in particular, we saw what's going on now, a very fluid situation is developing, in particular in Venezuela, and at some level in Argentina as well. And so if you look at our business, we\u2019ve got about -- each of those countries, our business is a little less than $200 million of revenue in each of the two countries. We\u2019ve been in them for many decades so we have a very capable local management and we have a good position in those markets. But inevitably, it does create both some risks in terms of our revenue growth in \u201914 as well as financial risk. And that\u2019s something that we monitor very carefully and we manage carefully given the volatility that we have in those markets and in others. So if you look for example, today in Venezuela which is what we\u2019ve called out as the most significant of the risks, we run the business on a local basis, the net monetary asset position of the balance sheet is basically flat. So that gives us a very good position in terms of addressing any risks that might occur. But we also have a $40 million receivable in sitting apparent from the subsidiary on imported goods and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re watching and managing quite carefully because we do recognize that there\u2019s risk there that we\u2019re going to have to manage through. So I would say nothing that\u2019s material for the corporation, but certainly something that we\u2019re very carefully monitoring and reacting to so that we can manage that risk. It\u2019s just really a conversion risk. And of course, you see in our results overall very strong pricing in the emerging markets which is the other component of how we manage the risk of these countries. So we feel good about our ability to manage risk. But as I say, we\u2019re also very cognizant of the fact that we need to be proactive as well.\nAndrew Obin: And the other side of the coin, the Health Care you get a high margin, high growth business in emerging markets part of the strategy. If wear well in terms of top line growth. Could you give us a sense of how connected is this business to effect fluctuations or is it fairly shielded just in terms of how the business works in emerging markets? How should we think about it?\nInge Thulin: Yeah, I know it\u2019s a good question. So I would say that you start in terms of FX risk, you have to think first about the overall risk profile that we have as a company and Health Care as part of that. So we hedge on a rolling basis 50% of our exposures which covers all of our business flows and our intercompany exchange fluctuations. So that applies to Health Care as with the other company, other sectors of the business. So that\u2019s an important element that enables us to manage the risk. And then the second piece is obviously through time, the best way to manage foreign exchange risk is to have a balanced footprint of exposure structurally, so that\u2019s one of the reasons why we continue to localize the production of our products into the countries where we sell which gives us a balanced foreign exchange risk profile and I think as you know, we\u2019ve been working hard to both grow Health Care and as part of that strategy to localize production which helps us to have a good profile to have local production, local R&D which is closer to customers, but it also gives us a better risk profile from a foreign exchange perspective. So I would say Health Care, I don\u2019t view as something with, if you will outside risk compared to the other sectors in our business.\nAndrew Obin: I guess what I was trying to say, just like me -- just saying, is Health Care spending in emerging markets? Do you feel it\u2019s the care versus consumer spending? It was sort of simple question I think.\nInge Thulin: Okay. While, I think it\u2019s -- as I\u2019ve said early in order for you to build out your business in a way, you will be able to move Health Care products going their way than their consumer. And you\u2019re talking about developing economies due to the fact that these many drivers, in terms of key opinion leaders that try to get to a service level and outcome around health, that is very strong. This is, you think about consumer which is very much retail brand equity driven which take you a longer time in a way to change the mindset of people to go from one brand to the other. So again speaking, we say that in the model that I\u2019ve showed you multiple times now in terms of how developing economies are evolving from manufacturing to infrastructure to safety to retail consumer and Health Care. Often Health Care can come earlier due to that element and in Health Care, generally speaking in fact, dental and orthodontist is coming faster than the big Health Care business. So for us it\u2019s a good model. We have still huge opportunities there. We\u2019re very pleased of the growth we see that this outcome is based on some strategic investment which they started a couple of years ago, actually in order to build up that business.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning.\nInge Thulin: Good morning David.\nDavid Begleiter: Inge, very good margin performance in Safety and Graphics, is this -- what type of operating leverage would you look for in safety in 2014 over course of the year?\nInge Thulin: Well, I would say first of all, thank you for the compliment relative to the improvements of the margins. And I think one of the reason there is that some consolidated -- consolidation that was done of the businesses. And so as we move ahead into next year, we\u2019re basically looking for the same leverage into 2014 specifically in that business. So I don't see as any new change for us. So I think we\u2019re on the level now that is in the end of it, very competitive for us.\nDavid Begleiter: Understood. And just a follow-up on Asia, line growth is low, was it all due to the tough comp (inaudible) was there some slowing in end market activity as well?\nInge Thulin: Generally the Asia performance was in line with where we\u2019ve seen it growing through the year. And as we called out, I\u2019d say couple areas that slowed, one was in China and that was most particularly related to the underlying electronics business. If you look at the base business excluding electronics grew at 6% in China. And then if you look at our performance in Japan which is the other most significant business we have in Asia. We grew quite strongly 4% overall but we were double-digit in the Industrial area. So I would say David, most specifically we see it linked to the electronics performance in Q4.\nInge Thulin: Very -- continue very strong growth in consumer and Health Care business.\nDavid Meline: Yes.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Winoker: Thanks. Good morning guys.\nInge Thulin: Morning, Steve.\nSteven Winoker: Could you just start with inventory impact in terms of distribution obviously important. Were you seeing any kind of stocking increases, decreases, how should we think about that?\nInge Thulin: Generally speaking this quarter, no change, right. We didn\u2019t see anything -- we didn\u2019t see anything of it on Industrial, general Industrial or specifically as we know, we could be more concerned around consumer electronics. We didn\u2019t see any change there and the other thing is around retail. I think retail was very stable as well. And as you know, they manage it very, very carefully. So I will say, we don\u2019t see anything there in terms of change and it\u2019s not a concern for us as we\u2019re sitting here now.\nSteven Winoker: Okay. So all that U.S. growth is sort of core customer growth on the manufacture side -- Industrial -- in Industrial?\nInge Thulin: Yeah, correct. We had very -- in U.S., we had a very strong growth in whole Industrial space right, which then had a very good impact for many of our businesses, generally speaking right in the Industrial space. So you\u2019ll have the whole Industrial business grew but you have also Safety and Graphics with all the personal safety business doing very well in environment like that. So that was good for us. So Industrial in U.S. in the quarter, Industrial basically would have 8% growth and safety and graphic had 6% growth. And then it was a little bit slower in the consumer and the Health Care in United States at the end of this quarter.\nSteven Winoker: Okay. And maybe just one more on pricing, so 1.4% again very strong making up as you mentioned for this combination of currency [devals] elsewhere as well as sort of just core R&D supporting margin. But maybe can you give us an idea again of that 3% to 6% growth in 2014, how much of that are you into, saying this volume versus price? And do you think that your ability to keep up with continued currency moves with price. Any issues on that front as you look forward or we couldn\u2019t just sort of count on those two offsetting each other?\nInge Thulin: Yeah, no it's a good question. So if you look at the -- as we looked at it in the fourth quarter and set out the guidance our thinking has been that is primarily volume that will look for in 2014 on the top end on the revenue line but obviously so in other words we expect price to be declining through the calendar year as we step through the quarters. Now that would change and it goes back to the view to the extent we see weaker foreign exchange occur in certain of the countries where we operate certainly will have to look at the actions that we need to take to preserve our position in the market and our ability to remain competitive but certainly our experience most recently in 13 but you can look over a longer period of time as long as we continue to develop -- to offer a very strong price value equation to the customers we\u2019re able to address that through price as we need to. So I think we feel comfortable that we can do what's necessary to maintain that relationship.\nMatt Ginter: Hey Steve, it's Matt, just to clarify one thing. Price issue will be positive in the year but the positive impact should moderate as the quarters go on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research, please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: First question for David on corporate expense, you would highlight that that would come in lower and it just come in lower and you said that there would some ERP expense and that would be shifted to the segments but it still came in lower than what we were looking for. So is there anything else going on in corporate and what should be the run rate of that in the course of 2014?\nDavid Meline: Right, 14 yes, so the corporate expense line that came in a little bit lower in the fourth quarter and frankly there are ups and downs there based on closing out accruals on a quarterly basis or one off of them, so I would say nothing that I would point to that was of a particularly you know headline an unusual nature in Q4. If I look forward into 2014 we expect that the corporate expense line is going to come in for the year somewhere in the range of 200 to 250 versus I think it was 320 in 2013and the majority of that you can largely attribute that to the declining pension expense, so we\u2019ll pick up about two thirds of the $150 million pension expense decline I mentioned will show up I that corporate line hence a reduction year-over-year of that magnitude and again it bounced around quarter-to-quarter but generally speaking I think it can you know pencil that in throughout 2014.\nDeane Dray: Good, that\u2019s really helpful and then David I know you guys are not in the quarterly guidance business but for the first quarter would you want to call anything out that would be unique seasonally, (inaudible) for seasonal I mean both calendar and as well as whether that might be a factor that we should be considering anyone primers.\nDavid Meline: Yeah, so if you look at the business through the year what I would say is that we consider most of the factors whether that be at the topline, whether it\u2019d be expense elements, we think that it\u2019ll be pretty steady through the year and follow more typical seasonal patterns. So I\u2019m obviously first and fourth quarter typically at the lowest revenue but you know that\u2019ll be the case as we see. The couple of exceptions I would offer, one is one we already talked about which is we do except through the year to see some declining contribution of price in raw materials as we move through the years, so positive but declining. Secondly, we had called out in December and that continues to be our intent which is build some of the incremental investment we\u2019re making in our European center of expertize on a year-over-year basis as well as some restructuring actions that we have them looking at primarily in Europe and the US that some of those would be about $20 million to $30 million of additional expenses which are comprehended. There is the strategic investment line, but you can see that it will be some what front-loaded for the year into Q1. And then the final point I would make on, this is the one I talked about already, which is what\u2019s happening in the markets globally right now. We are monitoring carefully developments in some of the emerging markets with the specific focus on Venezuela because I think there is some discernible risk there, some event risk which looks like may materialize as soon as Q1.\nDeane Dray: Great. Thank you for the color.\nInge Thulin: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLaurence Alexander: Two quick ones. On your comment about the slightly weaker trend in infrastructure market, are you seeing any signs of that bottoming out? And secondly with respect to emerging market volatility or credit risk that maybe developing there, is that an opportunity for you to further gain share because of your relatively low cost of borrowing and excess to trade onto finance, or do you think that that will really have a material impact on your relative share position?\nInge Thulin: Let me -- on the first question, I think that in terms of the infrastructure specifically, for us was related specifically to utilities and government businesses in one part of the world and is also related to the mining industry there. We see that easing up as we go into 2014. So it's not overly concerned for us. In terms of emerging market and so let me give a perspective on developing and emerging market. We have been in the developing world for many years. So the thing about 3M, we started to do business outside of the United States in the 20s and in fact, we have done business in BRIC. In Brazil, we went 1946. So we've been for longtime in that part of the world. And the strings for 3M based on the history, is that we have learned a lot, so we know how to monitor situation like this. And in developing economies that will always be some type of bump in the road as you go. Now, we have a very good point to say that when that is happening and we have not only seen it, we have lived it many times over the year and not only to organization but me personally and David Meline as well, as we have lived in some of those countries. So we have seen it and we have worked in those environments. The strings for 3M, when this is happening is we were never going back. We continue to stay but we are adjusting our organization. And we are in all cases I would say from an historical perspective, we are coming out stronger when it's done. And the reason for that is, we right sized the organization. We stay, continue our local connections and we help the customers that are still there because when it turns again because if will turn up, we are there with them. So in all cases, what have happened for us is that in the case when you come in the turmoil like this, we are coming out stronger due to the fact that we stayed. And I think that's an important element to know. So we are very local in the countries, but we have very strong centralized team with experiences that can help out in terms of making sure that processes is right even on the financial side and David will make comments relative today.\nDavid Meline: Yeah.\nInge Thulin: But it\u2019s actually -- for us, it's not a good think generally speaking, but we are coming out stronger after a turbulence like that.\nDavid Meline: And you are right, Laurence, we try to maintain a conservative posture from a risk management perspective. And we do enjoy the benefit as do other large well managed multinationals of having good access to credit, having the ability to assess credit risk and so exactly. While it can be bumpy to front end if you basically keep your head down and remain calm and have a playbook as we do, typically we can be advantaged as you see things start to turn around.\nLaurence Alexander: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nAjay Kejriwal: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.\nInge Thulin: Good Morning, Ajay.\nAjay Kejriwal: So maybe on Health Care margins you talked about the medical device that impact. Maybe, any comment on what you saw in drug delivery systems and the transfer and the impact on margins from the business and then also I know in the past they really have talked about flexibility in that business in terms of how you manage margins and spending relative to topline. So if you can comment on how we should think about margins in '14 for Health Care?\nInge Thulin: Well, as you ask specifically about DDSD, that is very much a project base business. Right, so we are selling R&D to other companies and we are selling products. So that's a business that can move a little bit in terms of quarter-by-quarter. So there was nothing happened at these unusual meaning that we lost business or something like that. So it's a strong business for us. In fact we have extended some of the bigger contracts have now been extended. So as we look ahead for that business, it's a very solid, very good business for us and we are very pleased with that. So looking from that as -- there is all ways to stop in the beginning to a quarter and these quarter based on the contracts and project, we're working with, this is how it came out. So that's, I wouldn't like it to be overly concerned that business. In terms of Health Care, (inaudible) speaking in terms of the margin that David will make some comment relative to that.\nDavid Meline: Yeah. So if you look, Andre, if we look, I think its how it looks for us in 2014. I'd make a couple of comments and maybe just pick up a little bit of comments here on the overall trends. So Health Care we expect to run in the low 30s through 2014. The Industrial Safety and Graphics and consumer we expect to run around as its been the case around the company average. And if you look at electronics and energy this year, we ran in the high teens last year which is what we expected as started the year. This year we see that trending towards the high teens, towards 20%. So that's how we're looking at the overall view for the businesses and I think the final point I'd offer, I talked about the corporate line, there is about a 30 basis points year-over-year increase in the cost that will be seen in the businesses as it relates to our strategic initiatives around business transformation, the restructuring we've talked about and the innovation funding.\nAjay Kejriwal: Got it. That's very helpful. And then, maybe, some color around stock repurchase and the range you have 3 to 5 billion, maybe just conceptually, what would be the variables that drive that purchase near the high end versus the low end?\nDavid Meline: Sure. So, yeah, so if you look at that and just kind of frame the commentary. So as we announced in December, we made a decision as a company to adjust our capital structure to one that's more efficient. So by definition that means increasing from a de minimis level, the portion of our funding from borrowing, right, from bond issuances and borrowing. And it means that we also have to, as part of that reduce the portion of the structure that's coming from equity funding. So by definition that means we've reduced the equity funding, we're going to do buyback with set of 17 to 22 billion for the period. We then looked at the sources and uses to the best we're able to predict them in the year and we concluded that -- it looked us, starting the year three to five billion at the gross level looks like the right number for the company. And as I said in December the way I think about that is that, it's certainly something that's more discretionary than a number -- frankly many other of our variables we manage from a sources and uses perspective. But it's our best views, we start the year and what we'll do then is, we'll have a portion of that repurchase that we do on a steady basis through the year. We also look and pay attention to intrinsic value to the price in the market of all assets including the one we are repurchasing here. And that impacts how we deploy capital into that area. So we'll adjust our share repurchase through the year based on the overall view of the business and sources and uses, and we'll also adjust the repurchase activity based on thinking about the core component, as well as how the share prices is looking as well.\nAjay Kejriwal: Got it. Thank you very much.\nInge Thulin: Thanks, Ajay.\nDavid Meline: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Good morning, guys.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Shannon.\nDavid Meline: Good morning.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Hey. David, just maybe if we could size this Latin America last year you called out with Venezuela and Argentina, so you said they're both less than $200 million in revenue each?\nDavid Meline: Yeah.\nShannon O'Callaghan: So, I mean, at the corporate average margin, you're talking about sort of less than a dime of EPS. I mean, is that the scope of the risk you're talking about or is there more risk than that, I mean, because there'd be -- could things get worse than that in terms of losses or other impacts?\nDavid Meline: Yeah. It's a good question, Shannon. So I don't see right now from what we can see and obviously it's pretty fluid, if I were to size that risk, I think there's event risk that could put the exposure from an earnings perspective into the $0.03 to $0.04 a share range.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Okay. Thanks that helps.\nDavid Meline: Yeah.\nShannon O'Callaghan: And then the strength in Europe, right, I mean, you talked about Germany being very strong, broadly I think but also in -- particularly in Industrial? I mean do you have a view in terms of how much of the strength you're seeing in Europe is intrinsic to Europe versus related to export?\nInge Thulin: Well, I think, it's a mix and I also think one other thing we have to think about here is, yes, there are comparisons, right. But, first of all, we see very good acceleration, specific on the Industrial side, I would say both in Germany and also even if the reporting issue nothing, we have talked about West Europe, we also see that in Poland actually. So I think we see both West Europe been driven by manufacturing uptick, which I would say, it's a balance in between domestic production for Germany, but also export for them, of course, as you know it\u2019s big automotive industry in Germany that we're exporting quite a bit. But, so I think we have still to be cautious about Europe, but it's a very positive trend and if we look upon it for our side, in West Europe, we had Q1 this year was a minus 3%, we're basically flat in Q2. We have the 3% growth in Q3 and another 3% in Q4. But I will say when I look upon it when you get Germany from flat in the first half of the year to around 6% then it was 8% in the last quarter that's very encouraging for us and again, as I said, there are businesses there for us that had good growth versus -- Industrial had 6% growth in West Europe. So it's encouraging for us but we still have to be cautious as we go into the year and we are type of looking upon West Europe next year for flat to 3% growth, right.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.\nDavid Meline: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDrew Pierson: Hi. Good morning, it's Drew Pierson on for Steve.\nDavid Meline: Good morning.\nInge Thulin: Hi. Good morning.\nDrew Pierson: I know we're running long, just quickly, I don't know if you've commented on the linearity of the quarter, if there anything interesting to call out in terms of month-to-month trends?\nDavid Meline: Within the quarter, yeah, I would say nothing, Drew, that we'd want to point to that would be unusual spikes up or down beyond what we've talked about more generally this morning.\nDrew Pierson: Yeah. And then on the price cost side, I believed you mentioned, kind of the closing -- gradual closing that gap through the year, just when we think about the components of that, I know you have your sourcing programs, I know the raws have maybe picked up very slightly? But maybe just a little bit more color around kind of how to think about the different factors and how they progress?\nInge Thulin: Yeah. So if you look at the components of price and raw materials, so we talked about prices where we exited 2013 quite strong. We see that then moderating as we walk through the year, towards the de minimis level, right but still slightly positive. And if you look at raw materials what we indicated our outlook for the year was another favorable $0.05 to $0.15 a share performance in 2014. We exited the year actually pretty stable with raw material performance. So we were down a couple of percentage points in \u201813 through the year including Q4 and we see that moderating somewhat as we move through the year but there will be some carryover impact certainly as we enter the first part of the year.\nDrew Pierson: Okay. Thanks for the detail.\nInge Thulin: Sure.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley, please proceed with your question. Hello Nigel, your line is open. Please proceed with your question. I do apologize. Nigel Coe, your line is open, please proceed with your question. I will close his line. That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.\nMatt Ginter: Well, thank you again for joining us today.

So let\u2019s begin today\u2019s review, I\u2019ll turn the program over Inge. Please turn to Slide number four.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Matt, and good morning everyone. As always, I appreciate you joining us for today. I\u2019m pleased to report that Q3 was a strong quarter for 3M. We posted an all-time record for quarterly sales and every business grew sales organically. All five business groups posted margins above 20% while we continued to advance our strategic priorities and investments. Let's take a look at the few third quarter highlights. Sales rose 5.6% to a record of $7.9 billion. Organic local currency growth was 5.8% in the quarter, led by safety and graphics at 8%, Health Care at 7% and Industrial at 6%. Our consumer business grew 4% organically as did electronics and energy. This quarter\u2019s organic growth of 5.8% was a significant improvement versus the 2% growth in the first half of 2013. Industrial, safety and graphics, as well as electronics and energy showed the most improvements. On geographic basis, developed economies such as United States, West Europe and Japan also showed substantial improvements. On a year-to-year basis, we posted positive organic growth in all geographical regions. Latin America, Canada led a way with double-digit organic growth of 11%, Asia-Pacific rose 7%, the United States were up 5% and Europe, Middle East, Africa increased 4%. As expected currency was the headwind to sales, reducing worldwide sales by 1.7% and acquisitions added 1.5 points to third quarter growth. So all-in-all, a very strong quarter with organic local currency growth of 4% across all developed markets and 10% in developing markets. Operating margins were again strong at 22% or 22.4% excluding the first year impact of acquisitions. All five business groups delivered margins above 20% while also growing their top lines through a continued broad based effectiveness and efficiency. Earnings were $1.78 per share up nearly 8% versus third quarter 2012. Finally, we\u2019ve returned $2 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases or $4.8 billion through nine months of the year. In summary, it was an excellent quarter for 3M on many fronts and our business is continued to grow very profitably. I thank the 3M team for their outstanding effort to deliver these very good results. Let me now review the outlook, please turn to Slide number 5. With one quarter remaining in the year and the business performing to all the expectations, we are narrowing our full-year guidance to $6.65 to $6.75, this is a previous range of $6.60 to $6.85 per share. On organic local currency growth, we\u2019re also narrowing the full-year 2013 range to 3% to 4% versus a pervious expectation of 2% to 5%. We continue to expect that currency impact would reduce sales for the year by approximately 2%, and we look for acquisitions to add about 1.5% to sales for the year. As for the 2013 tax rate, we now anticipate the range of 28.0% to 28.5%, and free cash flow conversion is expected to be approximately 90%. Now Dave will be taking you through the details of the quarter, David.\nDavid Meline: Thank you, Inge. Let\u2019s begin with the review of sales growth, please to Slide 6. Organic local currency growth was 5.8% in the third quarter, which was a significant acceleration versus the 2% we saw in the first half of the year. Volumes contributed 4.8% to third growth and we continued to see good pricing power with selling prices up a 4 percentage point year-on-year. Acquisitions added 1.5 points to sales growth in the quarter, related to Ceradyne in our industrial business and FSTech in safety and graphics. Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 1.7% points in the third quarter. Currency impacts were negative 6% in Latin America, Canada and negative 5% in Asia Pacific, while EMEA had a positive 3% currency impact year-on-year. Third quarter, sales rose 5.6% in dollar terms. Looking across geographic regions, Latin America, Canada led the way with strong organic local-currency growth of 10.5% in the quarter. All five business groups contributed to growth in the quarter, including double-digit organic growth in Industrial, Healthcare and Safety and Graphics. Asia Pacific grew nearly 7% organically in the quarter. China, Hong Kong grew by 11% in Q3 with notable strength in Safety and Graphics and in Healthcare, followed by electronics and energy. Organic local-currency growth was 5% in Japan, led by Industrial, Healthcare and Consumer. Organic local-currency growth was 4.5% in the United States, Healthcare, Industrial and Safety and Graphics led U.S. growth in the third quarter. In EMEA, organic local-currency sales growth was 4.3%. West Europe was up 3%, year-on-year, continuing a positive trend. This was our strongest growth in West Europe since the first quarter of 2011. Middle East, Africa increased double digits and Central and Eastern Europe also posted good growth in the quarter. Organic local-currency growth was 4%, across all developed markets, a positive step up versus recent quarters and 10% in developing markets. Let\u2019s turn to Slide #7 for a discussion of the third quarter income statement. Sales rose 5.6% to $7.9 billion, which is the highest quarterly sales result in 3M\u2019s history. We generated $3.8 billion in gross profit and gross margins increased 10 basis points year-on-year to 47.6%. SG&A and R&D investments rose 8% and 6% respectively. Operating income increased 3.6% in Q3 to $1.7 billion. GAAP operating margins were 22%, down 40 basis points year-on-year. Included in these results was a 40 basis point impact from acquisitions, therefore underlying margins were equal to last year\u2019s third quarter result. Leverage on organic volume growth added 40 basis points to operating margins in the third quarter and the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices added 1.2 percentage points. Strategic investments and one-time actions reduced margins by 80 basis points year-on-year. This represents incremental investments in disruptive R&D, our ERP system and restructuring actions. Foreign exchange impacts reduced margins by 30 basis points and the combination of the U.S. medical device tax and other factors negatively impacted margins by 50 basis points year-on-year. Third-quarter earnings increased 8% to $1.78 per share. Foreign exchange impacts hurt EPS by $0.04 versus the third quarter of 2012 and a lower tax rate added $0.02. Average diluted shares outstanding declined 2% year-on-year, which added $0.03 to EPS. Now, let\u2019s turn to cash flow. Turn to Slide #8. We generated $1.2 billion of operating cash flow in the third quarter. Working capital investments were higher year-on-year, largely timing related and we will expect that they will reverse in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $404 million, an increase of $46 million versus last year's third quarter and we expect full-year CapEx will be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. Free cash flow was $747 million and we converted 61% of net income for the quarter. For the full year, we anticipate free cash flow conversion will be around 90%. We paid $431 million in cash dividends during the quarter or $1.3 billion year-to-date. If you look at our balance sheet in today\u2019s press release, you would see that the worldwide cash and marketable securities are $1.6 billion lower today than one year ago. We\u2019re managing the business with lower cash levels, the US in particular for several reasons. First, the business continues to grow and generate significant cash flow. Second rising interest rates are positively impacting our already well-funded pension status and finally our capital structure remains very strong, which is an important component of our business model, but we do not intend to strengthen it further. Gross share repurchases during the quarter were $1.5 billion and for the reason cited above, we\u2019re increasing our expected range to $4.5 billion to $5 billion versus a previous range of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion for the year. And as Matt mentioned, we\u2019ll provide a full planning update at our upcoming Investor Meeting in December including capital structure and capital allocation. Now let\u2019s review our third quarter performance on a business-by-business basis. Please go to Slide number nine. Our industrial business had a good third quarter with sales up $2.7 billion and 6.2% organic local currency growth. The growth was broad based as all operating divisions and all geographies posted positive growth. Our aerospace and automotive OEM businesses generated double digit organic local currency growth and we also saw strong growth in advanced materials, liquid filtration, automotive aftermarket and industrial and adhesives and tapes. On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales rose 13% in Latin America Canada, 8% in EMEA, 6% in the US and 3% in Asia Pacific. The Ceradyne acquisition added 4.1% to growth in the quarter. Integration is going very well and profits continue to exceed our expectations. Nine different 3M divisions have launched development projects that leverage Ceradyne Technology. First year\u2019s sales are a bit short of plan due to US troop draw down efforts, but we\u2019re winning new business with customers. In September for example, we earned an $80 million contract to supply enhanced combat helmets for the U.S. Marine Corps. Third quarter operating income was $568 million and reported margins were 21.3%. Excluding Ceradyne, industrial operating margins were 22.2%. Margins were also impacted by negative FX and strategic investments in growth programs and our ERP system. Please turn to Slide number ten. As expected, our electronics and energy business rebounded nicely in the third quarter compared to the first half of the year. Sales were $1.4 billion up 4% in organic local currency terms and operating income rose 3% to $300 million. Margins were 20.7% up a bit versus last year\u2019s third quarter and up 3 percentage points sequentially. Electronics related sales increased 4% on an organic local currency basis. Market demand was stronger year-on-year and we\u2019re expecting to a number of newly introduced electronic devices. Most industry sources are projecting flat demand for electronics this holiday season. As a result we\u2019re planning conservatively through year end. On the energy side, organic local currency growth was 3%. Electrical markets led the growth, boosted by record sales of our ACCR overhead power conductor. Communications and renewable energy were both slightly positive year-on-year. On a geographic basis organic local currency sales increased 6% in Asia Pacific, 3% in Latin America, Canada and just slightly in EMEA. Organic sales declined 1% in the U.S. Please go to Slide 11. We saw our growth accelerate in safety and graphics in the third quarter. Sales were $1.4 billion up 8% organically, a significant increase from the 2% in the first half of the year. We generated double-digit organic growth in personal safety products and in roofing granules. Our Commercial Graphics and Building and Commercial Service businesses also posted good organic growth in the quarter and traffic Safety and Security rose slightly. Sales in Safety and Graphics grew organically in all major geographic regions with strong double-digit growth in both Asia-Pacific and Latin America/Canada. The FSTech acquisition added 0.9% to growth in the quarter. Safety and Graphics generated an operating income of $315 million, an increase of 7% versus last year\u2019s third quarter. Margins were up slightly year-on-year to 21.8%, excluding FSTech third quarter 2013 operating margins were 22.1%. Now let\u2019s look at Health Care found on slide 12. Sales in this business were $1.3 billion, up 7% in organic local-currency terms. As was the case in Industrial, we generated positive organic sales growth in every division and in every geographic region within healthcare. Organic sales growth was strongest in food safety, health information systems, oral care, drug delivery and critical and chronic care. On a geographic basis, organic local-currency sales increased 11% in Latin America/Canada, 9% in Asia-Pacific, 6% in the U.S. and 5% in EMEA. And across all of the developing markets Health Care generated 14% organic sales growth. This is very similar to recent quarters. Operating income was $426 million, up 7% year-on-year and margins rose 40 basis points to 32.1%. Margins were helped this quarter by a gain on the sale of a small non-strategic asset, offset in part by the U.S. Medical Device Tax, the net of which added 1 percentage point of margin. Our Health Care business continues to post strong and consistent sales growth and excellent profitability. This helps stabilize the more cyclical elements of our portfolio, the business generates tremendous value for 3M. Finally, let\u2019s review the Consumer business found on slide #13. Consumer also posted a strong third quarter with sales of $1.2 billion and organic local-currency growth of 4%. Operating income was $247 million, up slightly year-on-year and operating margins were 21.5%. Organic sales growth was strongest in our consumer health care, home care, stationery and office supplies and DIY businesses. On a geographic basis, organic local-currency sales growth was 9% in Latin America/Canada, 7% in Asia-Pacific, while EMEA increased just slightly. Organic growth was 3% in the U.S. helped by a good back-to-school season. Developing markets within consumer grew 10% organically in the third quarter. Similar to Health Care, the Consumer business is a very steady grower with excellent profitability and is a stabilizing force within the 3M portfolio. That concludes our discussion of 3M\u2019s detailed third quarter results. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Inge.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, David. Before we take your questions, I want to highlight our progress on three important strategic levers, portfolio management, investment in innovation and business transformation. First portfolio management, we continue to strengthen and prioritize our portfolio. The Electronics and Energy business is a good example of where we are making progress. In the third quarter we consolidated the Infrastructure Protection Division in to the Electrical Markets Division. Given this business a lower cost structure, improved market relevance and greater in financial reach. Also, earlier this year, we integrated touch systems into the Electronics Solutions Division to align these businesses to better serve our customers. There is more portfolio work to be done here and we've continued to look at other structural opportunities. One of the primary reasons performing the electronic and energy business was to present a single 3M voice to the electronics industry. Now we are easier to work with and more relevant to launch fast moving electronics customers. And I\u2019m happy to report that we are receiving very positive reaction from customers on all these changes. Second level; investment in innovation. Innovation remains the center of our plan and as I hope you remember last quarter we shared some details about how we are investing in long term disruptive technologies with significant growth potential. We are now finding 20 new product platforms several of which are expected to be introduced to the market in 2014. We are also investing in a new state-of-the-art laboratory facility at our headquarters in St. Paul Minnesota, which I announced last year. We broke ground in August and construction is well underway. This new laboratory will be an important part for 3M's global research network. Finally the third level, we continue to make good progress with respect to business transformation and ERP implementation. We successfully went live in Taiwan, Russia, Indonesia and Philippines and in October we went live in Canada. Next up is our European Middle-East Africa supply chain center of excellence in Switzerland in November. Twenty more countries are scheduled for 2014. We expect to achieve benefits in many areas including supply chain, working capital management, customer responsiveness, improved business planning and faster decision making. In closing, we deliver strong third quarter with good broad based performance across all business. We remain focused on expanding our business driving productivity and executing a plan with strong discipline. I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions and comments.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] One moment please while compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Hi, good morning guys.\nInge Thulin: Good morning.\nDavid Meline: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Davis: Inge, I mean, you, I mean the topline growth is really coming through and I think that support is what you've been trying to accomplish. Can you give us a sense of how you think of this quarter as a bit of an anomaly in that margin -- your incremental margins at least based on some higher cost, ERP things like that, that came through. Would you anticipate that going forward, you\u2019d show us maybe a little bit better incremental margins or is it just something that the cost of the higher growth is going to impact margins for a while until things? Until these investments really normalize?\nInge Thulin: Yeah and first of all on the growth side I\u2019m pleased we are pleased with acceleration we saw through 5.8% in this quarter versus 2% in the first half of the year. And we need and I need to give some credit here to 3M team for doing a very good job in order to work very hard to take market share and had a specific programs in all business relative to competitive conversion. So I think that\u2019s an important element as we see the growth come here. And yes to describe the growth, in a way, to think about it, we have had steady growth in Health Care and Consumer now for several quarters in a row. They are very savvy, it's working very well. And this quarter you saw electronics and energy turn up and as I mentioned that in my comments and David comment on us as well. And then as we saw growth rate in industrial oriented business is turning up in Q3 versus first half and that was board based so it was very interesting to see it was industrial tape and adhesives, it was abrasives, was automotive OEM and it was in personal care. So it was broad base and we saw it very much also in developed economy, which was very good for us. So as you know in terms of moving forward, our plan is not margin expansion by definition. So we are committed to the plan we laid out. I think as you think about the balance of the portfolio with more growth in our biggest business, which is industrial that had a slightly tough comparison also versus last year. They had a very good Q3 last year and had a peak performance in Q2 of last year. I think you have to look upon at one industry also grew as they did in developed economy. I think you will see this type of shift in the mix. But I think as you move ahead, we are committed to our plan and overall, I am very pleased that now able to see topline growth and maintain margins. So if you think about we are delivering 22% bottom-line here, 22.4% excluding first year impact of acquisition. That\u2019s a very strong quarter and I\u2019m pleased with that.\nScott Davis: Yeah. Make sense. Just this is a follow on, can you help us understand, you -- we can see the progress on the topline. I just want to ask a question in slightly different way, I mean if you think about 2012, you finished the year with about 6% EPS growth, 2013 seems to be tracking around 6% EPS growth? I mean when you think about the longer term focus of 3M and you turned around the growth side and I understand you don\u2019t want to -- you don\u2019t necessarily need to show higher margin per se? But is there a chance that you\u2019ve -- I mean can you envision the 3M that can be double-digit EPS grower? Or is it really explicit in your model that you are going to be lower risk but higher quality growth company? I guess, I\u2019m trying to figure out, what -- how you think about EPS growth as it relates to topline?\nDavid Meline: Yeah. If I could start, this is David Meline. I would say what you have asked is very much, our thinking is aligned to what we\u2019ve talked about last year in November, which is, we laid out a plan where we had 4% to 6% annual organic growth one and half times IPI. We think that that is certainly something that is reasonable for us to continue to expect to achieve. You look at that we said 9% to 11% EPS growth, which is a combination of both topline organic growth, as well as the earnings growth that we would expect to get from other activities of the business that would include acquired businesses, which we continue to believe our relevant to our model that includes the impacts of also the non-operating items such as the continuing reduction on share count. We expect pensions to certainly contribute to our earnings going forward in the future years and we\u2019ll continue to balance. We will look at where the best opportunities are and to the point on this quarter, we think certainly at the present time where we can create the most value right now is to continue to invest towards the long-term health and growth in the business. So as you point out we are quite significantly investing in places like R&D innovation towards more disruptive technologies, improving our systems, which is a very important initiative for the company and taking the opportunity to also as we see areas where we need to maybe rebalance and restructure somewhat, which is part of the normal course of our business we invest to improve our competitiveness there as well.\nScott Davis: Okay. Thanks. Congrats on the topline guys. Thank you.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR. Please proceed with your question.\nAjay Kejriwal: Thank you. Good morning.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Ajay.\nDavid Meline: Good morning.\nAjay Kejriwal: So the organic growth rate clearly much better than expectations and much better than what we are seeing from other industrials in the quarter. So and that\u2019s great. So maybe talk about how much of this performance is end demand, I know you have talked about share gains, market penetration, but maybe a little bit color between end demand share gains? And then how much re-stocking might have contributed to the performance?\nInge Thulin: Yes. Well, thank you, Ajay, for the question. When we look at upon it, I assume you are also talking a little bit of channel inventory and so forth. First of all, overall, channel inventory levels appear to be balanced across businesses and geographical areas, but what we have to be -- we have to be watchful relative to the consumer electronic markets, particularly in the mobile and handheld small, small, in segments. So I think that we had a good lift for that business based on specking on platforms and building for the holiday seasons. So I think you saw little bit of inventory build in order to be prepared for that. Now all external facts that we see, you\u2019re saying that the holiday season for that segment will basically be flat, so that\u2019s one of the reason why we are very cautious as we go into their last quarter. Now we had a very good -- so you are right, we've had a very good optic here, specifically in the industrial based businesses and you have to assume that there is a slight improvement in the segments, but to be honest we don\u2019t see any differences versus any of our competitors. So what is happening here you know the execution from our team relative to competitive conversions is working very well. So overall I would say that the channel inventory levels are appear to be balanced only for us to be watchful which is based on external data relative to the consumer electronic market.\nAjay Kejriwal: That\u2019s very helpful and you\u2019re getting really nice pricing, especially in the context that some industrials are reporting pressure and I guess that reflects the pricing power of your brands and that my question is how should we think about pricing for you in a benign inflationary environment next several quarter.\nDavid Meline: Yeah. In terms of pricing, I would say, certainly, if you look at the performance in Q3, we are pretty pleased. We saw price performance was good pretty broadly across the portfolio with perhaps the exception in the electronics business where you of course have structural price declines. What I would say in terms what we see, of course, geographically, we do have you know more significant price actions are going on in locations where you either got weakening currency and/or inflationary pressures as the result. So if you think about Latin America, again we saw significant price movements, we\u2019ve also been working in Japan where they\u2019ve had obviously a significant devaluation of their currency, as well, and then of course right now our comps are a little bit easier in the second half on the pricing basis versus the second half of last year. So at the end of the day, the issue for us is to continue to offer good refreshed products which will give us strength in the market to be able to command price that reflects the value we\u2019re offering to the market and as we do that, that tends to provide also a very nice halo effect for the entire portfolio.\nAjay Kejriwal: Thank you, very helpful, nice quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line from Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein, please proceed with your question.\nSteven Winoker: Thanks and good morning.\nInge Thulin: Morning.\nDavid Meline: Good morning.\nSteven Winoker: Could you just -- may be just can drive a little bit more through the cash flow and the effect of that recovers through the end of the year, but still you're going to end up a little bit lower than you expect. I mean to what extent is that still kind of driven by the additional growth?\nDavid Meline: Sure Steve. Yeah, so if you look at cash flow certainly year-to-date we're running about the same level as we did last year, which is I guess 76% year-to-date versus 75% last year. Obviously, it bounces around some quarter-by-quarter and typically for example in Q4, we would expect better conversion, which is why we're expecting 90% for the year and you know what I would say is very much the 90% would be reflective of the fact that we are investing in the business and at some level as you get an inflection in demand as we\u2019re seeing that tends to put some pressure on the working capitals like them. So nothing unusual, but just the reflection of seasonality really.\nSteven Winoker: And more inventory and receivables based or\u2026\nInge Thulin: Typically, yeah.\nSteven Winoker: Okay.\nInge Thulin: Typically, inventory and receivables are impacted as you are ramping up towards higher level of demand count.\nSteven Winoker: Okay. And then on the strategic investments and actions you talked about the ERP implementation and such. How do you see that progressing? Are there any other, where you think about those or you qualify also kind of feet on the street additional or what are some of the other actions that we can kind of get a better sense of how that money is getting invested?\nInge Thulin: Scott, I think, when we talked about strategic investment theory in this section, it was about investment in disruptive technologies that we talked about earlier. It\u2019s about ERP investment and then some restructuring on some of the couple of places around the world. And if you think about our model, 3M model is, we are basically working on this the whole time. I think one of the things here that we have stepped up is around disruptive technologies, where we announced in November last year. On November 8, we announced that we are type of-- in the plan moving from 5.5% closer to 6%. So that was a step up and the ERPs of course, also something that we are investing in, that will very much improve our efficiency and effectiveness and productivity as a company. Restructuring is pieces that we do ask where we go, all right. We type of look into that and we financed that in quarter-by-quarter, as you very well know as part of the business model. In terms of acceleration of growth and you talked about feet on the street in terms of commercialization. We have, as I took off, it\u2019s now almost 24 months ago. We made a big effort in terms of marketing excellence and sales excellence and I pointed individuals in order to lead that initiative type of more centralized in order to help with tools and so forth that execute locally. As we go, we make investment. You saw here when David talked in terms of investment, both in research and development and SG&A. We do that but in a careful way. We also have to look upon different models in terms of commercialization as we move ahead. We have to adapt and make sure we do it in the right way. But you have to look upon at every business group by definition or working towards their objectives in terms of margin expansion and growth. And that is where they ask for additional investment that is in addition to the three, David and I talked about this morning, then I would say layout is type of normal business procedure as you grow your business. But we feel good now. We start to see the growth. We have made investment as you know in Healthcare specifically, we build out our capabilities in international sometime ago and we continue to see that delivering which is very good for us. We take market share, we improve our penetration and we have good margins in that business, the same with consumers. So we look upon it and balance it altogether, those two businesses, consumer, Healthcare steady continue to move forward. And then, we had three out of business groups really ticking up this quarter including Safety and Graphic, as we saw had a very good quarter for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.\nAndrew Obin: Yeah. Good morning.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Just want to follow-up on what Scott was asking you. So, as I sort of think about the quarter, you\u2019re getting fantastic pricing. Emerging markets which is high margin is outgrowing, Healthcare margins are going up and is outgrowing. You seem to be making very good progress on energy and electronics. And your framework is topline growth of 4% to 6% and EPS growth of 9% to 11%. But it just seems in a quarter where sort of everything has gone right we still can\u2019t get over double-digit EPS growth. And the question I\u2019m asking, what would it take for you to get over double, what set of circumstances would get you to get over double-digit EPS growth if we can get it in a quarter like this?\nInge Thulin: Yeah. So, I would say Andrew, certainly, we think as we look at a quarter-by-quarter and year-by-year, we think is very reasonable from a planning perspective to expect to deliver our 9% to 11% EPS growth on the kind of growth that we are laying out here and at the end of the day and one particular quarter or another you\u2019ll have more or less impact of whatever it is, the medical device tax, the ERP spending on restructuring acquisitions, so I don\u2019t view this as something that causes me to think that we don\u2019t have the ability to deliver on our plan quite honestly.\nAndrew Obin: Okay. So just a follow question, what\u2019s -- you sort of addressed the gross buyback, but what is the change in net buy back for the year?\nDavid Meline: We would expect at $4.5 billion to $5 billion that our net would around $3 billion to $3.5 billion for the year.\nAndrew Obin: And the previous was, sorry?\nDavid Meline: Previous would have about $1.5 billion less than the gross, so that would have been about $2 billion to $3 billion.\nAndrew Obin: So it\u2019s not options, it\u2019s all going to net buyback?\nDavid Meline: The increase that I\u2019m talking about today would largely be reflected also in the net. So the gross increase -- pardon me.\nUnidentified Speaker: Yes, our outlook on the redemption side has not changed. So the whole change would go to net.\nDavid Meline: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Hey, on the industrial side, there was one of the few businesses that showed operating margin down year-over-year and yeah, you showed nice organic revenue growth in the quarter. Was the margin hit mostly from Ceradyne or were there any other items that would have created that pressure?\nDavid Meline: Sure Deane. So just to frame the performance in industrial, first of all, we were quite pleased with the way the growth inflected up for us to 6% in the quarter. And if you look at that first of all, it was a combination, it was both developing markets which grew 7% and we saw a quite strong improvement in our developed markets were we grew 6% in the industrial, so point number one. Point number two is, if you look at last year we were under 23% margin, so it was a certainly an exceptionable quarter while comparing to last year. If you look at our core operating margin in the quarter, we were a little over 22% excluding Ceradyne and the other impacts that brought us from that 22% down to the reported 21% were \u2013 basically the same ones we talked about elsewhere. So the impact on industrials margins of the disruptive R&D technology investments results gets spread through the businesses. The impact on the business of the ERP investment, which is about 30 basis points, FX impacted them negatively and then one thing we haven\u2019t talked about today, but it\u2019s impacting across the enterprise this quarter is, we\u2019ve ramped up now. We\u2019re in the process of putting in place -- Well, Inge mentioned that our European -- our new European supply chain activity and so that\u2019s having some impact on us here in the third quarter as we ramp that up and get ready to go ahead and go live.\nDeane Dray: Great and then Inge, we\u2019re really interested in hearing that this promise that you made a while ago as --- when you closed on Ceradyne, you were very excited about how many different divisions of across 3M leveraged ceramics and here we are seeing a -- I think you said nine divisions will be marketing products that leveraged Ceradyne in some way. So could you give us a sense of where are those products? It will also be a 2014 events? Are there more to come because there are certainly more divisions that leverage ceramics at 3M and potentially for that technology, would you provide some more color on it?\nInge Thulin: Yeah, well I think from a business group prospective, you\u2019ve -- you will see it mostly in the industrial space, but you will also see it in some businesses in healthcare, in the orthodontic piece. We say now that these nine that have -- that are ready to commercialize, if you recall my -- on our call last time, I talked about 13 division to 15 division that are looking into it and they are continuing to looking and it\u2019s actually expanding. So the answer for your question more to come; yes, more to come, in terms of the nine that we quote you yesterday, they will roll out different type of activities during 2014. So when we look upon that acquisition in total, we are very pleased crystal wall, the integration is fully complete and also we are pleased to report that fully integrated to 3M. And as you\u2019ve seen now, we have taken couple of sizable orders we had -- we announced last quarter, an order around $40 million. And as David talked we got another one this quarter of $80 million that we\u2019ll start to be delivered next year. We will not deliver that this year. So we have -- we've got to order. We are now qualifying it and it will be roll out next year. So I think -- on the bottom line, as David said, we are meeting and exceeding our blue book in bottom line. So in terms of both get some thing in front end around $400 million and then you have technology in the back office that we can leverage a fantastic thing for us.\nDeane Dray: Yes. Just from an exclamation point on that, I know that there has been a lot of skeptics at the time of Ceradyne closing that some of the military orders were in jeopardy. And since then that looks that was application and that $80 million order came through and there are others like that?\nDavid Meline: Well, you can say it\u2019s actually handed $20 million because we have $40 million last quarter, $80 million this quarter. So that\u2019s under $20 million. So -- and that is one of the -- one of their segments for that business. So I cannot comment on orders that we are negotiating that is not finalized but we are very encouraged with what we see.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLaurence Alexander: Good morning. Could you give us a little bit more detail on two end markets with the electronics growth you are seeing, can you parse how much of what you are seeing is because of your own pivots or share gains as opposed to the health of the underlying markets? And then on the Safety and Graphics, architectural coatings, can you talk a little bit about sequential trends that you are seeing there?\nInge Thulin: Well, first of all on the electronics and energy, we -- the electronics piece grew 4% for us and the energy piece grew 3%. And in the energy segment, it\u2019s through the ACCR that David talked about. That\u2019s clearly we are taking market shares. So we are now taking quite a number of orders and very much back in West Europe which is encouraging for us. As you probably recall, when we talked to earlier, that said relatively long -- I will say not relatively long. It\u2019s a long sales cycle for that product. And that\u2019s now start to be qualified specked in et cetera. So we see orders coming in many countries, West Europe specifically as they were interacting. So I think in that piece you can clearly say that we are taking market share in the energy piece of the segment. On electronics, I will say for us as you know, we will be expecting on platforms and we are -- and that\u2019s one of the optic we see and then I will say generally speaking in that segment, we have a strong position. We have always had a strong position and what is working well for us is that we are both able to provide technologies that will enhance those product for all the customers and able to drive down cost as fast as possible. In terms of real market share data there, I think that will be more result of how the sales through will come in the end of the day because as I said we are -- take it very easy now as we\u2019re going to Q4 and make sure that we had sales through in the channels. On safety and graphics, orders, what was your question there relative to\u2026\nLaurence Alexander: The weakness you sliced it on architectural construction markets, if you could maybe talk a little bit about what you are seeing sequentially and I guess, then again if you impasse your own performance to (Inaudible) you think you might be losing share or if you think you are gaining share relative to the market?\nInge Thulin: No first of all that is relatively small business for us. We started at couple of years ago. The base for that business was actually Japan from the beginning. Japan have done very well building out that business. And we took the Japanese model and adjusted that and try to build out first and foremost in United States and also in some selected places in West Europe with Italy be in the center of it relative to design. So I will say that when I look at -- when I look upon that, it\u2019s not losing market share. I think it\u2019s temporarily shift in the market place and so forth. I don\u2019t -- and it\u2019s not considered on yelling [ph] and speaking that business for us in terms of we're losing market share.\nDavid Meline: More project based.\nInge Thulin: Yeah it\u2019s a project based business. You would see a little bit of that going in and out of quarters, but we are doing very well there with some of our film stuff is coming out from our film technology laboratories. And we are doing very well in lighting generally speaking. Look at on it more as project based, can go up and down a little bit the business is relatively small for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura. Please proceed with your question.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Good morning, guys.\nDavid Meline: Good morning.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Shannon.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Hey, Inge could you maybe just give a little bit more flavor on these 20 new product platforms, your funding in terms of these disruptive technologies. You know kind of general areas you are talking about and maybe the rough size of the opportunities things.\nInge Thulin: Yeah I can. I will not talk about all 20, but I can talk, yes, to give you a flavor of what we are doing there. So you have to go back to the background. This is based on that we step up the investment and research and development from historically 5.2% to 5.5% closer to 6% and that those money should go into the, what we call, classified and more disruptive technologies. And I say couple of the product, then I would type of just talk about them that is maybe closer for us because there is a couple of them that are in the first stage, very close to the first stage development of completion and that will be rolled out in 2014, maybe in the middle of the year to later in the year, but we are type of encouraged around them and there's a couple of them. Various teams for building constructions is one that is based on something where we believe we should be able to capitalize on some growth relatively fast. There is a protective film for electronics and appliances which is very encouraging that can be used for OEMs, that oriental appliances and electronics. There is a light management constructions that are both into residential and commercial and that\u2019s very -- so all of -- if you think about those, all coming out from our film technology platforms, that smart grid sensor cables that we believe will be something we should be able to commercialize fast and effectively and west Europe is the target for that specifically. And then we have the [indiscernible] enhancement film that is just on the way to be rolled out. So if we look upon, as you can see its much here around our base in technologies, from platform perspective. It's going in to businesses step off everything from electronic and energy to the safety in graphics and industrial business. So you will hear more about them as we go, but this all to be real and at least for me and for us to see, as so it's always type of platforms that start to come to life and that we believe that we should be able to roll out during 2014 is very encouraging. So we are very pleased the way the organization took this initiative to heart, moved it forward and we are focused a lot and make sure we give the bigger program and more resources and more resources and some of them that was good initiatives and maybe dreams that we always should have and we maybe reprioritize them.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Okay, thanks. And David if I could take one more crack at this kind of EPS thing. Putting the quarter-to-quarter variability and things aside, I mean the high end the organic range now for this year's 4%, which should probably in your framework at least put to 9% EPS growth and it's not this year in the guidance. So is there -- I mean you're getting a little hit from FX is that it or is there anything else this year that\u2019s not converting, you know making the four equal nine that would in the broader framework?\nDavid Meline: Sure. So if you look at over a long period of time, acquisitions we are certainly topline contribution. We are not seeing a significant at the moment bottom line this year. Pension we had a contribution this year, we had about a hundred million dollars, so that\u2019s contributing. Tax I think is pretty much carry over year-over-year and that\u2019s a contributor if you recall in our five year bridge. We've got a couple of points in the tax. So that would be something that\u2019s not present in current calendar year and then the last one would be we\u2019re -- frankly we are investing quite heavily in the front end for example with this R&D innovation initiative which should contribute in the future. So it\u2019s kind of pay now in terms of long term investment with future results, same as true with the ERP system.\nShannon O'Callaghan: So \u201813 is sort of a heavier loaded investment years, I mean would that be main difference?\nDavid Meline: Yes. Correct.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie: Hi. Good morning everyone.\nDavid Meline: Good morning.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: So just following up there with on Shannon\u2019s question, moving from 2013 to \u201814, seems like you have had a lot more of a heavier year this year both on ERP spending, the R&D spending. Talk us through may be some offset into next year or is it possible we do get an acceleration and start to see 5% to 6% growth if the incremental margin from the business will get a lot better and so it will be better portfolio in \u201814 versus \u201813?\nDavid Meline: Sure. So if you look at \u201914, obviously will come out with that here in December, but if a kind of frame, I was thinking about \u201814. I would start which is, we are certainly a more constructive on the overall macro economy. We think we will see some improvement in both industrial production and GDP. Although we think the improvements are going to be slow but directionally we are encouraged. We will continue to invest in \u201814, so the investment, if you look at we talked about going to 6% on R&D. We are on that path and incrementally we\u2019ll invest more next year in R&D. Same with the ERP that will be likely our peak year of investment in our -- in the ERP system and so that will be the part of the plan next year. We do expect in terms of the things that are in view -- we do expect pensions now to be certainly a $100 million or more of expense benefit next year. And then finally, based on what we\u2019ve been doing with reducing the share counts through the year, you can expect that will be additive to EPS again next year as well. So I would say we feel quite good about the momentum that we have right now going into 2014 and will be able to share more detail here in December.\nJoe Ritchie: I think that\u2019s a helpful bridge, David. Just a clarification on the incremental spending on ERP, I think I had a roughly $50 million incremental next year. Am I ballpark\u2026?\nDavid Meline: Yes. That\u2019s still in the right ballpark.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. Great. Then one last question on growth for 4Q, just implicit in your 4Q guidance, just curious on the -- from the year-on-year perspective, you had really nice growth organically this quarter at 5.8%. Your guidance essentially imply that there will be a step down sequentially on a year-on-year growth perspective, just given some of the commentary that you had on the electronics business?\nDavid Meline: Yes. Well, if you look upon the 3% to 4% for the year, that implies roughly 2% to 6% in the last quarter which is aligned what we have done for the year. So I think the way we look upon it, we are very focus now to make sure we end the year strong here. And I think the business that we are -- cautious as you call out yourself is and what I have talked about is that electronic and energy as we move ahead. But talking about that business, you think about it, generally speaking, you think about the margins for that. We have gone now through the capital quarters. We went 53 in Q1 to 77 in Q2 and 20.7 in Q3. So constant improvement on the margins. And we have said from the beginning of the year that we will deliver high teens for the year for that business and that\u2019s what we believe we will do. So I think the Q4 will be a little bit more of a challenge for that business but very pleased with the progress both in terms of growth and the way they have been driving productivity in the underlying operation and taking the portfolio management to half and really improving that business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Tusa: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking me in.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Steve.\nDavid Meline: Good morning.\nStephen Tusa: On the healthcare gain, did you guys have -- in the total company bridges where is that -- discounted? Is that under organic volume or the med device tax other line?\nDavid Meline: That would be in med device, other.\nStephen Tusa: Okay. Thanks for that now. And then on now on Ceradyne, there was a little bit more of a headwind to margin. It looks like we\u2019ve kind of breakeven this quarter relative adding with mid-single digit margins last quarter, is that seasonality or further acquisition charges or investment, what\u2019s going on there?\nDavid Meline: Yeah it\u2019s a combination, Steve. So one that the booking of orders tends not to be -- there are some lumpiness in terms of those project. So we had a pop-up in Q2, which was a little bit less in Q3 now. And then secondly there has been quite some integration activity which is impacted expenses here in the quarter, so that also was part of what contributed that.\nStephen Tusa: Okay and then there is just one last question for the year the margin, you guys have given sales guidance, I guess it's kind of baseline people on the fourth quarter, what's kind of a good range for the total operating margin for the fourth quarter or just for the full year?\nDavid Meline: For the full year we \u2013\nStephen Tusa: For the total company?\nDavid Meline: Yeah we expect it to be pretty similar to what the full year was last year.\nStephen Tusa: Okay, great. Thank you.\nDavid Meline: Thank you.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe: Good morning and thanks for going along here.\nInge Thulin: Good morning.\nDavid Meline: Good morning.\nNigel Coe: So Inge, you talked about the pickup in investment for some of the top five initiatives. Yes, R&D has been pretty flat, year-to-date about 5.4%, so I\u2019m wondering if you're getting better base productivity within R&D and do you still see this sense as the two long term targets?\nInge Thulin: You said the 6%?\nNigel Coe: Yes.\nInge Thulin: Yeah. Well, first of all -- it's clear for me that we start to see more productivity out of the laboratories and I\u2019m pleased to see that to get both investment in R&D and productivity on the same short is fantastic when you do that at 3M and we start to see that then we are just ending up our strategic planning cycles here and I can tell you when I looked upon every business group, when I looked upon international and I look on the total company line outs and investments and productivity target for research and development, I was very pleased, right, so I had more effort on that, so the answer for your first question is, yes. Is 6% right as we go? I\u2019m not changing that at this point in time. I think it's important, re-stating the cost, relative to make investment, relative to research and development because I believe and we believe and its DNA of the [indiscernible] that is the heartbeat of 3M, that is where we really make a difference as we move ahead, but again we are very focused on making sure we get productivity out from every program that we put in place, but we are not changing the target for the plan, productivity is improving and so overall we feel good about it.\nNigel Coe: Okay, now that\u2019s helpful. And then switching to David, obviously that the free cash provision has been decided by CapEx, well ahead of tangible D&A and I\u2019m just wondering given the ambition to raise CapEx to $2.1 billion over the five year plan, when do we started to see tangible depreciation stepping up and you know we\u2019ve had a lot of questions about the 10% plus EPS growth and I\u2019m just wondering sort of extent that step up intangible is a headwind to EPS growth over the next five years.\nDavid Meline: Tangible? You are saying a step in depreciation is that the point?\nNigel Coe: Yeah, as efficient you have dealt with CapEx?\nDavid Meline: We don\u2019t see -- I don\u2019t foresee a significant step-up in depreciation if you measure it as a percent of revenue. So we expect to be pretty steady in terms of CapEx percent of revenue, if you look and assume the profile of the CapEx is not dissimilar to the past that would imply that depreciation would drag with revenue growth. So I don\u2019t have that pegged as a headwind in the business. And if any of anything, we\u2019re expecting with the completion of both the globalization of our capacity. And secondly, as we get in place this year pre-system and get better visibility on data we think will have a chance to run -- run our supply change more efficiently.\nOperator: And our last question is a follow-up question from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.\nAndrew Obin: My questions have been answered. Thank you.\nInge Thulin: Thanks. Andrew.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of the conference call. I will now like to turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.\nInge Thulin: Well, thank you very much for joining us today. Thanks for your time. Appreciate your questions very much -- very much appreciate your interest in 3M and we look forward to speaking to you soon.

Welcome to the 3M Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) It is recommended that you use a landline phone if you\u2019re going to register for a question. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, July 25, 2013. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nMatt Ginter: Thank you and good morning. With me here today are Inge Thulin, 3M\u2019s Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Meline, our Chief Financial Officer. Welcome to our second quarter business review. Note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to mention a few calendar items. We will announce our third quarter earnings on Thursday, October 24th and our fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, January 30th. In addition, we\u2019ll host an Investor Meeting on the afternoon of Tuesday, December 17th at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, in Midtown, Manhattan and for calendar purposes, please plan on 1 to 5 p.m. on that day. If you turn to slide number two, please, during today's conference call we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. So let\u2019s begin today\u2019s review and I\u2019ll turn the program over Inge. Please turn to slide number three.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us for today\u2019s call. Second quarter was another good one for 3M. We continue to grow our sales, profits and free cash flow in the face of a continued slow growth economy and a strong U.S. dollar. Sales grew 3% year-on-year to $7.8 billion, an all-time record for any quarter in 3M\u2019s history. Organic local currency growth was 2.3% in the quarter with Health Care leading the way at 6%. Industrial and consumer each grew 3%, and safety and graphics grew 2%. In electronics and energy, sales declined 2% on an organic local currency basis. As I told you in each of the last two quarters, we expected a challenging consumer electronics market in the first half of 2013, and our prediction was correct. We continue to anticipate some recovery in the second half of 2013 in this business. Geographically, Latin America, Canada led way with organic growth of 9%, Asia-Pacific and Europe, Middle East, Africa each grew 2% and the United States was up 1%. Currency impacts reduced worldwide sales by 1.3%, impacted by the weak Japanese yen. Acquisitions added nearly 2 points to second quarter growth. Second quarter operating margins was strong at 22% on a GAAP basis or 22.4% adjusted for recent acquisitions. Earnings was $1.71 per share up 3% versus second quarter of 2012. Free cash flow in the in the quarter was $1.3 billion a second quarter record for 3M and we converted 107% on net income to cash. Finally, in the quarter, we returned $1.6 billion of cash to shareholders via dividends and repurchases, a step up versus recent quarters. David will have more to say on this in a moment.  Entering 2013, we anticipated slow market growth in the first half of the year and that is how it played out. I\u2019m pleased with our performance especially given this backdrop. We also expected a second half recovery based on improving macroeconomic trends and recovery in the consumer electronics. This remains our view today. Please turn to slide number four. Looking at full year guidance, we are maintaining our previous expected earnings range of $6.60 to $6.85 per share and organic local currency sales growth of 2% to 5%. We now expected currency impact will reduce sales for the year by 2% versus the prior expected reduction of 1.5%. Acquisition should add about 1.5% of sales per year.  As for the 2013 tax rate, we now anticipate the range of 29% to 29.5% versus a previous range of 29.5% to 30%. And we continue to expect free cash flow conversion of 90% to 100% for 2013. Now I turn the call over to David for details on the quarter .\nDavid Meline: Thank you, Inge. Let\u2019s begin with slide number 5, where I will break down the second trend in sales. We generated organic local currency growth of 2.3% on midst of continuing challenging economy. Volumes contributed 1.7% for a growth and selling prices increased 1.6%.  Acquisitions added 1.9 points to sales growth in the quarter, the majority of which came from Ceradyne which was acquired by our industrial business in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 1.3 percentage points in the second quarter, largely due to a 20% year-on-year decline in the Japanese Yen versus the U.S. dollar. In Dollar terms, worldwide sales grew 3% versus the second quarter of 2012. On a geographic basis, Latin America and Canada led the way again in this quarter with organic local currency growth of 8.5%.All five of our businesses posted positive growth in this region led by double digit results in Health Care.  Organic local currency growth Asia-Pacific was 2.2% in the second quarter, with Health Care again up double digits. Safety and graphics also had a nice growth in the quarter, China, Hong Kong, grew 3.4% organically in Q2 and Japan declined 2.3% year-on-year. In EMEA or the combined Europe Middle East and Africa, second quarter sales increased 1.9% on an organic local currency basis. Four or five businesses posted positive growth lead by Health Care and industrial on a sub-EMEA level we achieved double digit organic growth in middle-east Africa and single digit growth in central East Europe. And organic growth turned positive in West Europe in the second quarter, which was encouraging to see after several down the quarters.  In United States, organic local currency growth was 0.8%, growth was positive on our Health Care, industrial and consumer businesses and declined in electronics and energy and in safety and graphics. Let\u2019s move to the income statement, please turn to slide number six. Second quarter sales were 7.8 billion up 3% in dollar terms. Our growth profit percentage was 48.3% down 30 basis points versus the second quarter of 2012. Investments in SG&A and R&D both increased 5% year-on-year, operating income was $1.7 billion down 1.5%.  Operating margins were 22%, down 90 basis points versus last year\u2019s stronger Q2 results. Included in this quarter's results was a 40 basis points headwind from acquisition therefore underlying Q2 margins worth 22.4%. Profit leverage on organic volume growth added 20 basis points to second quarter operating margins and the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices added 80 basis points. In addition, lower year-on-year pension and OPEB expenses added 10 basis points to second quarter margins. Factory utilization reduced margins by 50 basis points, an improvement versus the first quarter and largely in line with our expectations. Strategic investments impacted margins by 40 basis points. This represents our ERP and business transformation effort along with more R&D aimed at disruptive innovation. Both will strengthen 3M for the future. Finally, the combination of foreign exchange impacts, the recently enacted medical device tax in the U.S. and other factors reduced margins by 70 basis points year-on-year. Second quarter earnings were $1.71 per share, up 3% versus the second quarter of 2012. The second quarter tax rate improved to 27.4% versus 30.1% last year which added $0.06 to earnings and foreign exchange impacts reduced second quarter earnings by $0.02 per share. Now let\u2019s turn to cash flow, turn to slide number seven. Second quarter operating cash flow rose by $290 million year-on-year or 21% to $1.7 billion. The increase was due primarily to lower pension and OPEB contributions along with improved working capital. We invested $394 million in capital expenditures during the second quarter, up $36 million versus the second quarter of last year. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures in the range of $1.6 to $1.8 billion. Free cash flow rose by $254 million or 25% to $1.3 billion. Free cash flow conversion was 107% in Q2, a 19 point improvement versus the second quarter of 2012 and we continued to expect conversion of 90% to 100% for the full year. Cash dividends paid were $436 million in the second quarter, up $26 million year-on-year. As a reminder, we increased the per share dividend by 8% this past February. This marks 55 consecutive years of dividend increases and the company has now paid a cash dividend for 96 consecutive years. Gross share repurchases were $1.2 billion in the quarter, up $551 million compared to Q2 of 2012. And as Inge mentioned a step-up versus recent quarters, we now anticipate a range of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion of gross repurchases for the full year 2013, versus a prior expectation of $2 billion to $3 billion. We are increasing this range for a few reasons. One, our business is operating well and generating substantial free cash flow which we expect will continue. Two, rising interest rates are positively impacting our already well funded pension status. Three, we did not close any new acquisitions in the first half of 2013. And finally, our capital structure is already strong today and we do not intend to strengthen it further. Let\u2019s review in more depth our second quarter performance on a business-by-business basis starting with industrial. Please go to slide number eight. Second quarter sales were $2.7 billion in industrial, up 3.3% on an organic local currency basis. Growth was strongest in the aerospace and automotive aftermarket businesses followed by liquid filtration, industrial adhesives and tapes and automotive OEM. Sales in industrial grew organically in all major geographic regions with Latin America and Canada up 9%, the U.S. and EMEA up 3%, and APAC up 2%. In November of 2012, we acquired Ceradyne, Inc one of the leading ceramics companies in the world. Ceradyne\u2019s sales were $116 million in the second quarter which added 4.6% to industrial growth and the business was profitable on a GAAP basis. We are pleased thus far with the integration effort and look forward to continued success in this business. Second quarter operating income was $599 million and reported margins were 22.5%. Exact positions industrial operating margins were 23.2%. Now let\u2019s move to safety and graphics, turn to slide nine. Second quarter sales were $1.5 billion up 2% on an organic local currency basis. We generated a positive organic growth in commercial graphics, personal safety products, architectural markets and building and commercial services. Sales declined organically in the roofing granules business and in traffic safety and security systems. On a geographic basis organic local currency sales rose 9% in Latin America, Canada, 7% in Asia Pacific and 1% EMEA. The US declined 3% in the quarter. The FSTech acquisition added 1.1% growth in the quarter and the business is on track to meet its top and bottom line targets in 2013. We\u2019re aggressively integrating this business to capture significant cost and sales synergies. FSTech increases our relevance in the large highway infrastructure market and is the natural growth (inaudible) for a reflected sheeting and pavement marking business. Operating income in safety and graphics was $333 million and operating margins were showing 22.9% against the very tough comp of 25.9% in the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, second quarter of 2000 operating margins were 23.8% and we\u2019re investing to accelerate growth in this business particularly in personal safety in our recently formed mining, oil and gas business.  Next up is electronics and energy found on slide 10. In electronics and energy sales were $1.3 billion for the quarter down 2% in organic local currency terms. Operating income was $237 million and margins were 17.7%. As we anticipated margins were down year-on-year, but importantly showed nice improvement versus the 15.3% margin that we posted in the first quarter. Organic local currency sales declined slightly on the electronics side, consumer electronics and market demand has been fairly tepid throughout the first half of the year, but by and large the market seems to have stabilized and the third quarter sales should show recovery. End market inventories were heavy at year end and have improved as the first half has progressed with some modest [overwriting] still remaining in the hand held space.  And energy sales declined 4% in the second quarter. Our heartland electrical markets business had positive organic growth and continued to perform very well in Q2. This growth was more than offset by declines in other energy related businesses. Renewable energy in particular posted a double digit sales decline in the quarter, this market continues to seek a bottom which is impacting our growth. While we do see sales stabilizing in the second half and the comps begin to ease. We\u2019ve been actively working to repurpose these assets for other 3M businesses where we anticipate growth. On a geographic basis organic local currency sales increased slightly in Latin America, Canada and declined in other regions.  Please go to slide 11. Health Care had another excellent quarter posting the highest organic growth and the highest operating margins amongst our five business segments. Sales totaled $1.3 billion up 6% on organic local currency basis. We continue to see broad based growth across much of the Health Care portfolio including health information systems, food safety, critical and chronic care, oral care and infection prevention. Sales in Health Care grew organically in all geographic regions, led by double-digit performances in both Latin America/Canada and Asia-Pacific. Health Care second quarter organic sales growth was 15% in developing markets on top of 13% in the first quarter. These are highly promising growth sectors for 3M and we continue to funnel investment dollars towards them and we\u2019re encouraged to see the positive results. In developed markets Health Care grew 8% organically in Japan and 3% in both U.S. and Western Europe. Operating income rose 1% to $417 million and margins were again strong at 31.2%. The recently enacted U.S. medical device tax was a 40 basis point drag on Q2 operating margins. Finally, let's review the Consumer business found on slide number 12. Consumer also delivered a good second quarter, sales were $1.1 billion, up 3% on an organic local currency basis. Profits rose 4% to $235 million and operating margins rose 40 basis points year-on-year to 21.4%. We grew organically across the Consumer portfolio most notably in Consumer Health Care where ACE and FUTURO brands showed particularly good growth in the second quarter. We also posted positive organic local currency growth in our home care, stationery and office and do-it-yourself businesses. Q2 is when we begin to see the impact of a back-to-school season and growth thus far has been encouraging. We have good placement in promotional programs in place and we\u2019re seeing some sales lift from our newly introduced family of Scotch Expressions Tapes. From a geographic perspective, organic sales growth was 7% in Latin America/Canada, 4% in Asia-Pacific and 2% in the U.S. Growth was slightly positive in EMEA. In developing markets, the Consumer business grew 7% in organic local currency in Q2. Like Health Care, Consumer is one of our most significant growth opportunities in developing markets, as retail sectors expand along with the growing middle class. Developed markets grew 2% organically. That wraps up the detailed outlook of the second quarter. Now, I will turn the call back over to Inge.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, David. Before we take your questions, I want to highlight our progress on several strategic fronts. Let\u2019s start first with a brief update on the integration of Ceradyne, which we acquired in November of 2012. Sales and profit exceeded expectations for the quarter, very good results and strong evidence of our progress. You\u2019ll recall that earlier this year Ceradyne was awarded a $40 million plus order for protective armor plates. We saw some positive sales in fact from this win in the second quarter. Let me also give some comments on our portfolio management efforts and our R&D investments. We are continuing to strengthen our portfolio through better product our decision and by addressing underperforming businesses. For example, recently we announced a consolidation of our infrastructure protection division which or has been under strategic review into the electronic market division. We expect to gain rapid cost synergies as we increase the scale and efficiency on the newly combined entity. In addition, this division share common end markets such as construction, electrical utilities and electrical equipment manufacturing. Back in May, we announced the sale of our fly fishing equipment business to Orvis. This is a good business and the market leader in its space, but it has no relevance to become important in the broader 3M portfolio. We\u2019re also making good progress in identifying new and promising technology programs. As you may recall, we\u2019re planning to increase investments in longer term disruptive technologies, aimed at opportunities with significant growth potential. We formed a review team call the 3M Innovation Board, comprised by myself, David, our Chief Technology Officer and our Head of Corporate Strategy. The team meets quarterly to review milestone progresses and previously approved programs and to screen new investment ideas. I\u2019m very encouraged of what I have seen so far.  Finally, we continue to move to move resources to our businesses with most promising growth opportunities. A great example is Health Care where the end markets continue to grow nicely and our technology and market positions gave us strong relevance with our customers. Consumer is another example, where retail markets in developing economies are now beginning to develop. And we\u2019re actively prioritizing our (inaudible) to ensure that they have the resources they need to improve their already strong market positions. In summary, first half conditions were challenging and 3M executed very well under the circumstances. We anticipate demand recovery in the second half of the year with some help from both the macro economy and the consumer electronics markets. And we remain focused on driving productivity and executing our plan with strong discipline. Thank you for your attention. We will now take your questions and comments. \nOperator: \n. :\nDeane Dray - Citi Research:  Thank you. Good morning every one. \nInge Thulin:  Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray - Citi Research:  I\u2019d like to start off on geographies and maybe comment on the significance and we haven\u2019t seen this on a while, but central Europe are showing stronger growth than the U.S., it is just the easier comps, but maybe just give us a sense of what you are seeing in Europe now?\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Deane. You asked specific about central East Europe, where we have had a good base for quite some time as you know as we have built out our businesses then. We see continued good growth driven by specifically Russia, Turkey and Poland, but also a lot of that of smaller countries there are doing well.  So I think its broad based for us and I\u2019m personally not surprised, I was (inaudible) visiting here, actually, this last quarter a couple of companies, including Russia. And it\u2019s very encouraging what we see in the marketplace then. Again, our portfolio have been build out with very much industrialist base, in that part of the world and now we see an increase in our businesses that\u2019s going into safety related businesses, but also health space taking off very well for us.  So I will say that, it\u2019s not a surprise for us. It\u2019s in fact encouraging as we have moved out our portfolio. And we have also made some investments that actually the last ten years or so relative to local capabilities both in terms of converting and manufacturing and now research and development. So we have a big place over there in Poland, in Rock Club, where we utilize a lot of capacity in order to serve that part of the world and recently as you maybe recall on the last quarter, we talked about, we\u2019re are now open also central excellence for logistics in Turkey, that overtime will service a breaching between central East Europe and middle East Africa. So it\u2019s very encouraging for us and we would like to be bigger there and as you are talking about central East Europe and middle East Africa, also middle East Africa had very good growth for us in the quarter. That\u2019s from a lower base, but basically all countries there grew, except, we have a little bit slower growth in South Africa, due un-stability in that country, so overall very good.\nDeane Dray - Citi Research: The commentary, same commentary for Western Europe?\nInge Thulin: Western Europe, first of all, we saw very, very slight growth for the first time in eight quarters which was encouraging for us. And the way we look upon it, we try to separate the in-between north and south, and in north are growing slightly better than in south. And I would say in terms of when you look upon the countries, I would say Germany was basically going sideways on a lower level. And we had little bit better growth in U.K. up to 5% to 6% in that country. And north for us will be identified as Nordic U.K., Germany, Benelux and also Alpine as the Alpine countries. So they depend on Germany. So it\u2019s on a lower level, going sideways but at least was encouraging to see that for the first time in eight quarter, so slight, slight growth on that part of the world. And as we have talked about earlier, we have really worked on the back -- back end of the organization in order to streamline that combined regions and try to manage their cost in the backend of the operation.\nDeane Dray - Citi Research: Thanks. And last one for me on safety and graphics, you have called out roofing granules and traffic safety and the slide also security but how would you split out the margin declined year-over-year across those three businesses?\nInge Thulin: I think there is three components there. You have, one-third is related to the FSTech acquisition. One-third is related to the decline in government-related project businesses and specifically into, say, road safety. And then finally, we are making some strategic investment in that business into mining oil and gas and to personal safety. The personal safety is a Heartland division for us and heading the quarter 6% growth and we\u2019re continuing to invest there. So those are the three elements of that business. And if you take out FSTech that business had an operating income of almost 24% in the quarter, 23.8%. So very good in our view even if it was a decline versus last year but not any major concern.\nDeane Dray - Citi Research: Great. Thank you.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: Thanks and good morning all.\nInge Thulin: Good morning.\nDavid Meline: Good morning.\nSteven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: I just want to follow-up Deane\u2019s questions geographically on the U.S. specifically was 2.3% last quarter, 0.8% this quarter, 0.7% volume. Just give us a sense for that slowdown specifically, if you could?\nInge Thulin: Yeah. I think when we look upon where we had solid growth, was in Health Care, industrial and consumer. So I think it was more relative base comparison and very much into some specific businesses that is, was related to government businesses as I talked earlier about and from safety and graphics business, very much related to road safety. And then we had also the granule business that I would say was an inventory correction for the whole industry that happened for that business specifically. We had a relatively good consumer business and a good back to school selling which I think was -- yeah that segment was up almost 10% as we roll into the quarter. Now, we have to look upon the sell out as we know as go into the rest of the year.\nSteven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: Okay. And then, second question, when we look at pricing across the different geographies and you see Latin America 6.1% versus the volume of 2.4%. And I presume much of that as inflation driven. I mean, can you give us a sense for how much you think is inflation versus just other kind of pricing power. I mean, obviously you are exhibiting a lot of pricing power there. It would be helpful to understand this?\nDavid Meline: Yeah. Interesting therefore I can comment. So if you look at and correctly a significant part of our reported price in the quarter was driven by Latin America, which is -- it was already up in the first quarter and we saw a little bit higher this quarter. And that\u2019s largely being driven by the fact that we have some of the currencies in several countries as well as inflation has been picking up, so what you see is the businesses are reacting to that to make sure we\u2019re preserving our profitability and it\u2019s in an environment where we\u2019re able to -- with the good brand positioning we have we\u2019re able to put through those prices and still deliver growth in the region. \nSteven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: Okay and sorry just one more. The 40 basis point to strategic investment margin headwind, I mean how long should we -- should we speak about building that into our forecast?\nDavid Meline: Yeah, I would say that the strategic investments for doing those as I mentioned earlier specifically related to our ERP business transformation which will go on for several years. Now, on year-over-year basis we expect that the phenomena you see this year will continue certainly through the end of this year and in the case of the innovation spend we\u2019re starting to see that picking up somewhat as we get into these approved programs. So I think from a planning perspective at least through this year you should expect that kind of investment level on a year-over-year basis and then as we get into next year\u2019s planning we\u2019ll give you guys an update as to what to think about that.\nSteven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura. Please proceed with your question.\nShannon O'Callaghan - Nomura: Good morning, everyone.\nShannon O'Callaghan - Nomura: Hey, David maybe -- can you just engage sort of an update on EPS contribution to now going forward from shares, tax, pension because you\u2019ve been buying back more shares, you\u2019ve got lower share calendar now that still goes lower and I imagine your pensions move ahead with interest rates. So maybe just engage what we should expect in terms of EPS (inaudible) from those?\nDavid Meline: Yeah, so if you look at pensions what you would observed as we\u2019ve called out few of the impact on margin in the first half. If you look at first quarter, second quarter that\u2019s added about point -- 3 points to the margins in the first half and you should expect that to continue through the balance of the year. Obviously as you start then looking forward into the future if we stay in this kind of an interest rate environment you\u2019ll start to see our expense further decline as we talked about last November. If you look at share counts correctly we\u2019ve up the amount that we would intend to buyback this year and so I think you can calculate the figures. But we will see some reduction in share count impacting the second half, but as do the averaging level the increase that we see in the actual buyback in the second half will have a bigger impact next year than this. So we\u2019ll see some pickup in the second half.\nInge Thulin: One thing that I would add to that Shannon is foreign exchange was a headwind in the first half to the tune of about $0.3 a share and that will get a little bit separate in the second of the year, when it would be closer to about a nickel in the second half.\nShannon O'Callaghan - Nomura: And how should we interpret the share repurchase in terms of what drove your decision to increase it and this is reset to a higher range or is this just a one off?\nDavid Meline: Yeah, it\u2019s a good question. So as I tried to call out for your -- in deciding how to proceed on that, we first and foremost look at how the business is running and certainly we\u2019re pleased with the performance of the business now and we think that we\u2019ll continue in the context of both the health of our business and the economy. Secondly the pension plans, we\u2019ve been -- obviously with the tick up in interest rates, if you look at our funding position -- funded position, at midyear we were about 94% funded globally in all of our plans versus 87% in year end. So (inaudible) that to continue that will be some easing on the demand for capital in that area which factors into our decision making and then as I also mentioned acquisitions we did not deploy in the first half. We continue to expect to and would guide to a billion to two this year, but inevitably timing is very difficult to call and certainly in this lower interest grade environment we\u2019re seeing that finding transactions where we can create value for 3M has been more difficult for us recently. So that will factor into our thinking on sources and uses of cash. And then finally, as I mentioned, the capital structure of the company, we think is certainly very strong and is adequate, and we wouldn\u2019t foresee strengthening it further. So add those pieces up, look at how those evolve that will inform us as to what kind of planning will do in terms of our buyback activity going forward.\nShannon O'Callaghan - Nomura: Just to clarify on the tax and pension, do you still, tax is coming in lower this year, do you still expect it to go lower in \u201914 and do you have a read on what pension payment would be at this point in \u201914?\nDavid Meline: Yeah. Sure. So that\u2019s right. So we guided tax to 29% and 29.5%, which is more in line with the tax rates that we had last year. Everything we see and again we are just now in the update of our long-term plan, we just started that. But we would foresee, we had indicated last year that by the end of the year period we would expect our rate to be in the neighborhood of 27% and I don't have any reason right now to things that would change as to the year-by-year precise amounts that something we will have to refine here as we go through the balance of the year. And in terms of pensions, yeah, I mean, as you know, it's a very significant consideration for 3M. We have very significant obligations and we\u2019ve absorbed over the last five years an increase in our annual pension expense cumulatively of $550 million. This year our pension expense versus last year has declined by $100 million and given the very strong funded position we have which is improving, given the fact that we\u2019ve now transitioned our workforce globally such that we are moving increasingly into defined contribution type profiles, considering very good return on assets, we\u2019ve been generating over recent years. And then finally, rising interest rates would cause us to expect expenses to decline. So if you were to close the year today, what we would think is that we\u2019d have $100 million or more decline in an expense next year.\nShannon O'Callaghan - Nomura: Great. Thanks a lot guys.\nInge Thulin: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan: Hey. Good morning.\nInge Thulin: Good morning.\nDavid Meline: Good morning, Steve.\nStephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan: Can you maybe just talk about any update to the price cost forecast for the year, it\u2019s kind of in line with the first quarter, there is some obviously some inflation driven price your are getting in Latin America pricing was better. So just maybe talk about that for the second half?\nDavid Meline: Sure. In terms of the price cost, we\u2019d indicated that, we expected some price improvement initially which were then decline as we walk through the year, and that continues to be our view on an overall basis. So we have some price performance in the first half here which was primarily driven by increases we took during the year last year, so naturally that would be declining as we move into the second half. In terms of the other piece of price which is, is inflation in foreign exchange driven that we\u2019ll have to see how things develop. But I would say that you could expect that we would continue to have a positive contribution there which would then be enabling us to offset the negative impacts of exchange.\nStephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan: Okay. So the price cost spread which I think you said we are going to be kind of plus or minus this year for the year is now better than, it\u2019s now more favorable\u2026\nDavid Meline: Yeah. I mean.\nStephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan: \u2026 (inaudible) so far.\nDavid Meline: Yeah. Sure. Price cost we expect will continue to decline quarter-by-quarter but it would be more favorable then what we had initially indicated at beginning of the year.\nStephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan: Got you. And now you in-- are you in position to put through, this year with raw materials in the economy, are you in position to get more price this year like you have in previous years, like another unusual kind of step up like you had maybe year ago or is it more normal this year.\nInge Thulin: Right. Yeah. From a planning perspective we don\u2019t, other than specific situations where you got exchange or inflation driven price movements, we don\u2019t right now have particular plans to be driving price. Certainly, to the extent which is normally what we drive to where we have significant and fresh products and good brand positioning, we have these (inaudible) but in the current cost environment our thinking is, is that steady as you go is the right poster for the company.\nStephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan:  Got you. One last quick one, I think can you maybe comment on what you are seeing in Latin America, lot of cross occurrence in the economy there, maybe if you could just talk about how you see the second half playing out?\nInge Thulin:  Well, we are optimistic relative to the second half and has David has comments, relative to the relation of organic growth and price for the first and second quarter, we are on plan relative to execution, we see a slight uptick coming in Brazil first, which is good, it\u2019s the biggest subsidiary for us down there.  And as you know what we have talked about before, we have a very broad based both portfolio and probably did best balance portfolio in only part of the world, in Latin America. And we have execution capabilities across world countries. So we see it a very positive for the rest of the year as well. And as I said, as we are being in that part of the world since 1946 and it\u2019s the -- I would say the role model relative to us, how to build out businesses in developing economies and I\u2019ve done very well, we feel good not only for the rest of this year, but for many years to come. And as you know, that business for us is as sizable as China and it\u2019s growing faster and it\u2019s very, very profitable. So we are optimistic about Latin America as we go ahead as we go ahead. In fact, I think, there are some acceleration for us for the rest of the year and beyond. \nStephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Great, thanks.\nInge Thulin:  Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, guys, good morning. \nInge Thulin: Good morning, Andrew.\nDavid Meline:  Good morning.\nAndrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes. Just a question on your Share buyback. Can you just tell us on net basis, should you increase the buyback, versus the previous expectations, right, because the stock has gone well, I\u2019m just wondering where did options go?\nDavid Meline: Right. So if you look at the reissuances that we expect to occur during the year, I think, we had originally guided, $1 billion to $1.5 billion. And right now, it looks to us like it will be at or slightly above the high end of that range. So think about a billion and half, maybe slightly above that, depending on what happens from the balance of the year. So if you then think about net, the 3.5 to 4.5 would imply somewhere approaching $2 billion to $3 billion net versus the original guidance of $1 to $1.5 billion.\nAndrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much. And second question on electronics and energy. If you look at sequential improvement, how sustainable it is going to the second half and what leverage do you still have left to first sort of to get this business improving in the absence of a recovery in electronic side. \nDavid Meline:  First of all, it\u2019s as you comment yourself, it\u2019s stabilized relative to first quarter. So we had -2 and -2, so basically you can say stabilized in terms of the growth on a lower level for us. You can see that we improved margins and that\u2019s the result went from 15.3 to 17.7 sequentially. And that\u2019s based on mixed improvement and better utilization. And you can also see the picking action here relative to our portfolio management, we have recently announced some combination of the couple of divisions where we then would drive cost and synergy in the backdrop is well, still capitalized on the front end.  Now it\u2019s clear as we have said earlier that, we\u2019re counting on the pickup in consumer electronic in the second part of the year and we see small evidence of that as we move into Q3 here. And we based out of course on what we see our (inaudible) on platforms. So I will say that we are on plan relative to that business, we need to see a big pickup in consumer electronics. But the way we look at on that, we see what we\u2019re expecting, we see that that's coming in our order flow for Q3. And then what will drive that for the rest of the year is of course, end market demand, right, which is where we are sitting still a little bit of difficult for us to see but we -- that\u2019s how we are planning for now.\nAndrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Can you continue to improve margin on the electronic side in the absence of growth?\nDavid Meline: Yeah. We can.\nAndrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Davis - Barclays: Thanks, guys. Good morning.\nInge Thulin: Good morning.\nDavid Meline: Good morning.\nScott Davis - Barclays: I know it maybe hard to answer this specifically, but when you think about, Inge, the investments that you\u2019ve made in R&D and also just in the core businesses and the changes you have made in, at what point do you see that inflection, do you think where you start to outgrow global GDP, even the last couple of years you have been growing pretty much in line with pretty sluggish global GDP. But I would imagine there has to be a point where you start to show some -- some real progress. Can you give us a sense of -- I just said 2014, can you -- can we see it this year, is it more like 2015, just give us a bit of sense of what you think?\nInge Thulin : Well, first of all I would say that we have outperformed the IPI lately. Right, so you look upon last quarter, you see this quarter, we have outperformed IPI just to make that clear because I think you said that we had not, right, in line, I think we outperformed. So we are pleased with that and just to give in perspective, at least while I am sitting, I am pleased that we have shown three quarters in a row organic local currency growth, right. So we had Q4 last year, Q1 and now Q2. So that\u2019s first the baseline that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking upon. So that\u2019s very encouraging. Now, when you make those shifts as we are doing, right, there is a couple of strategic shift in the company. Portfolio management is a level for us and is an important one. And as I talked about earlier we are -- we have put that in place. We are very serious about it. We are on that the whole time. That\u2019s an important level. And the second one is our investment in research and development, which is very much at this point in time, relative to disruptive technologies that will have a longer term outcome. However, in that pipeline, there is some project that I believe that we will be able to commercialize in the middle of next year. So I think the way the piece is moving for us, it is difficult to say exactly a time but you know I think that we should -- 12 to 18 months from now, we should start to see the traction of the moves that we are doing. And those elements here that are very important that all in order for us to strengthen the company as we go ahead. And I think as I said and David talked to earlier about our ERP initiative, as you think about the level for us is portfolio management, it is research and development, and then it is investment in ERP. Those three put together will strengthen the company as we move forward. But you know we start to see -- I start to see good progress on the growth side, but I am still not happy. Let me say it I am still not happy but I can see that we start to take market share and we are doing very well specifically in the Heartland division start to really get some good traction and automotive aftermarket this quarter was very good. And that again is related to us to be able to take market share and penetrate better on the world. The same I talked about personal safety, we had 6% growth in a big very profitable division for us that has the brand equity and the position around the world. So, I think that you see the focus we have got around the Heartland divisions has helped us in order to grow and is based on both taking market share and to improve penetration. And then at we look upon the businesses that have underperformed, that will over time help us to accelerate growth in those, what we call push forward at our businesses that are very good, very strong for us using multiple technologies but have a relatively smaller size based on their market but those markets are growing faster. So, I don\u2019t know if it is helping you, but at least\u2026\nScott Davis - Barclays: I understand.\nDavid Meline: It\u2019s not the direction where we\u2019re going.\nScott Davis - Barclays: Yeah, now I think the answer is actually very comprehensive in what you said about to be level in M&A is very relevant too. So as a follow up, you talked about M&A just because it is so important for a company that generates as much cash as you do to either have an outside buyback program or an outside M&A program. But what is your buy as is it relates to the type of things you want to buy? In your tenure we\u2019ve seen -- obviously if you buy Ceradyne, the (inaudible) fell through, these are fairly low growth assets, I mean is this -- are there emerging technologies that you\u2019re -- that you\u2019re looking at or is it more matured companies, I mean, just give us a sense of what we could expect out of M&A and the type of assets going forward?\nDavid Meline: I think I\u2019ll go back and repeat what I\u2019ve said earlier relative to -- you should expect slightly bigger than you\u2019ve seen in the past for the last five to six years. We did a, 60 to 70 acquisitions the last six years or so, many of them were very small and in geographical areas that was way out and was maybe in some cases difficult for us to lever from a execution perspective on the global base. So I think you should see acquisitions that are slightly bigger than in the past and you should see acquisitions that we should be able to lever and scale on a global base ideally and for sure on the regional base. And if there is a technology as part of it that will be very, very interesting.  And I think that was exactly what Ceradyne gave us. Ceradyne had a good solid front end in terms of business, but in addition there was a technology played at the very important for us that we can lever over many divisions in the company. So I think that\u2019s what you should think about. And that\u2019s also why the portfolio work that we\u2019re doing is so important, but across business as we go also be able for us to categorize the businesses and look upon opportunities as you go ahead. So we have a very active pipeline and as you know that we\u2019re looking upon them from different perspective and -- but I think you should think about it in the way of slightly big than the past, should be -- faster growing on average for the company will be ideally and then a technology piece of it will really be good because that\u2019s what we\u2019re all about, so we can leveraged around many, many divisions in the company due to the fantastic vertical integrated model we have both in research and development and manufacturing and the subsidiary strength.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs: So as it relates to organic growth, you did maintain your organic growth guidance for the year, yet outside of industrial and facing graphics counts do get harder across your segments in the second half. And in the midpoint, your guidance essentially implies an acceleration beyond the easing count. So my first question is were there any changes to the segment level growth expectations based on what you reported today and maybe you can talk a little bit about your confidence on hitting that second half organic growth guidance?\nDavid Meline: Sure, so if you looked at the guidance that we\u2019ve offered, which is maintaining the two to five for the year, which is what we\u2019ve had in place whole year. We had expected and that continues to be our view that we would see a second half that improves from the first, so no difference there. If you then look at the sector level, we gave guidance on the sectors at the beginning of the year for the whole year and generally we expect to be operating within those levels and those ranges. If there\u2019s any area where we have a -- the biggest question that specifically has been in years on electronics and energy, so if you think of our range for the year operating to the low end of that range would be in an environment where we wouldn\u2019t see any pick up in the economy, we wouldn\u2019t see any pick up in the electronics and energy space, which is not the environment that we\u2019re presently expecting. To operate towards the high end of that range for the year it would, as Inge was talking about, it would require not only the improvements that we\u2019re foreseeing in the third quarter in the electronics, consumer electronics space, but it would also foresee some additional economic pickup generally which is certainly not out of line with economic forecasts that are out there. And secondly, it would require pretty robust end-market demand in areas like general consumer, so think about a good sale out for the holiday season and then specifically in the consumer electronics business.\nJoseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. That\u2019s really helpful color David. And maybe one question for Inge on Ceradyne specifically. It seems like things went well in the second quarter, still behind plan for the first half of the year on the sales side, but doing better on EBITDA. My question is really around the technology platform and the uses of that platform across your other divisions. Can you talk a little bit about the opportunity there and whether you\u2019re starting to deploy it across to some of the other 3M divisions.\nInge Thulin: Yeah. We do and I think it\u2019s very much aligned relative to the synergies we see with different division. I think at this point in time 13 -- I think its 13 or 15 division that see that they can utilize the technologies that came in from Ceradyne. So we purchased the company and move it into one division and industrial. I think beyond that now there is a team in place that\u2019s looking upon the opportunities across businesses. And I think it\u2019s from the business groups where basically three of the five are very much involved. And I think its 13, let say, its 13 division I think it maybe 13 to 15 that see the opportunities in their different spaces. So it\u2019s we\u2019re very, very encouraged actually what we see then and Fred Palensky, our CTO, is very encouraged what we\u2019ve seen and he was very pleased even before we did acquisition. So I think we\u2019ll be able to talk about it more later when we see some specific programs coming out of the pipeline, but we\u2019re very pleased. And as I said, that acquisition maybe different in the way that was not only for us to purchase a position in the marketplace but also to get build out the technology platform that we had already in ceramics make it broader and deeper and then be able to kept for life which is what 3M is very good at.\nJoseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you very much.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR. Please proceed with your question.\nAjay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets: Thank you. Good morning.\nInge Thulin: Good morning.\nDavid Meline: Good morning.\nAjay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets: Maybe just on Health Care service, it\u2019s very nice to see your highest margin business also your fastest growing and we\u2019ve seen that for the last couple quarters now. So maybe talk about what you\u2019re seeing there, what\u2019s driving that growth? I know you\u2019re seeing very high growth rates in the developing market. So talk a little bit about sustainability, especially given what we\u2019re seeing on the macro side on the developing country. So one, what\u2019s your outlook is and then also implications for margins.\nInge Thulin: Yeah. First of all, when you think about that portfolio, 78% of that portfolio is today in developed economies. So you have 22% in the developing, if you look upon that portfolio from our perspective in Health Care. So that\u2019s indicating that we\u2019ve a very strong position in the developed world based on the value proposition coming out from those businesses through our base. So that\u2019s a very strong position to be in and we are growing in the developed world as well. We\u2019ve 3% growth in the developed world. So think about that. That\u2019s just indicating that the value proposition that we\u2019re providing to our customers are very strong. In the developing world, the growth was 15% in the quarter. And as we\u2019ve talked about earlier, we build out our businesses in the developing world, there is now the opportunity also for developed solutions in that part of the world. And I think, hopefully, you remember the way that we described how we build out the business staring with infrastructure, manufacturing, safety, retail and the finally Health Care. In many countries, we are now coming to that point in the end relative to Health Care and in fact, Health Care is going ahead of retail in many ways relative to the execution of our plan because there is a different type of network from key opinion leaders for Health Care versus in consumer, which is brand equity that is a key element here to be successful. So that -- I think, that\u2019s the reason for us that we have growth. We have growth both in developed and developing world, the value proposition is strong in both places. We have made investments for many years into the developing world in order to be ready for execution as that the programs are coming.  And we are able to show here that it\u2019s sustainable relative to margins and maybe (inaudible) said earlier, we should run that business overtime in the high 20s, but we\u2019ll be running it above 30 and we\u2019re still running it above 30. So that\u2019s despite that we are building out of capabilities very much relative to the execution of the programs, which means coverage in the marketplace.  And we are very efficient manufacturing a model there as well, where we\u2019re able to utilize both two huge centers around the world for manufacturing, but also many smaller converting facilities. So it\u2019s a very good business for us. We\u2019re doing very well and we are very pleased. And this is not -- it\u2019s not by accident helping planned for long time for the team here in order to come up to this position.\nAjay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets:  Of course, it\u2019s a very nice business and it tells that it\u2019s also your highest margin business, so good work there, maybe one question for David on utilization. So it\u2019s still a headwind, how should we think about that for the rest of the year, does that headwind come down as you allocate those assets to other businesses or is that more related to volume coming back in electronics. \nDavid Meline: Yeah, so Ajay, I would say generally the trend we are working towards obviously is the fully utilized all of our assets. So we\u2019re driving to get better utilization and obviously as we always are. We see some good progress here. So as I talked about last quarter, a couple of sources of that underutilization related to some businesses and renewable energy and one of our automotive areas where we had some inventory overhang, so that largely been addressed.  What\u2019s true for us is, is that the renewable space will continue to be an area that we\u2019re working through to identify exactly what are the prospects for the business going forward, how do we best participate there to offer technology solutions and also generate a return to the company. And that\u2019s probably going to take us into 2014 to come to some final solution.  So we will have some issues that we\u2019ll continue to deal with for the foreseeable future, but I think as you\u2019ve already seen, we\u2019re starting to get our arms around it and certainly the trend should continue to be down.\nAjay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLaurence Alexander - Jefferies:  This is very quick one. As I know we\u2019ve gone over. As you look at the ramp in your R&D investments in these new areas you are looking at investing in, is there an implication that in a few year result, there could be a step up in the CapEx cycle for the company for some reason or is it all going to be roughly the same capital intensity as the business with the business as you are already in?\nDavid Meline:  Sure. Yeah. I would say Laurence, in terms of our outlook for capital, as you would know, where we do the play capital at a level which is typically higher than the average peer, which is an outgrowth of the very significant level of vertical integration that the company has, because a lot of our technology is proprietary and know how that we want to preserve and therefore to do that when it\u2019s in the manufacturing process area, we feel the best strategy is to do it ourselves.  So we\u2019re quite vertically integrated and that will continue. In terms of does the step up in investment in R&D imply an increase in our CapEx? Right now we don\u2019t foresee that to be the case, but quite honestly we have to monitor how that progresses, because we -- there is a bunch of thing we\u2019re working on that we haven\u2019t fully developed yet. But I would say if I look over a longer period of time, I wouldn\u2019t expect that there is some implied step-up in our CapEx.\nLaurence Alexander - Jefferies: Thank you.\nInge Thulin: Yeah.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning and thanks for squeezing me in here. Again a couple of quick ones from me, just return to the margin which -- this is probably for David. The impact of FX, just one concern that\u2019s the transactional impact of U.S. export?\nDavid Meline: That is a -- yeah, it is.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Great. And then, maybe just a quick updates on where we are on $2.5 billion of, I guess, restructuring portfolio. You\u2019ve made a couple of actions in terms of one business in the [E&E] and the 3D business back in earlier this year. Just wondering where we are in terms of progress on that $3.5 million?\nDavid Meline: We have made some progress. And as I said, we have not put a timeline on it as that\u2019s difficult to do when you do business as you know in terms of what needs to be done. But we are focusing in on them and you have seen now probably three actions that have been taken relative to make sure that we improved in precision. We sold off one business and we have combined two and in fact, we\u2019re harvesting fourth one. So that\u2019s an ongoing process and we take it very seriously. So there is not a timeline on it by definition but what I have said to you and I have said internally, you cannot stay in that category for long. And so we are working on it and we are also doing the right thing in order for us to evaluate the right precision for those businesses as we move ahead.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley: And could you talk little about billion dollars of action is taken in those four businesses so far?\nInge Thulin: In terms of the portion of the businesses and the revenue impact?\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley: Yeah.\nInge Thulin: That\u2019s in the ballpark.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley: Yeah. Great. Thanks guys.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.\nMatt Ginter: This is Matt. I\u2019ll just say thanks to everybody for joining us for your questions. I appreciate your continued interest in 3M and Bruce and I\u2019ll be around for any follow-ups. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line."}, {"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 1, "year": 2013, "date": "2013-04-25 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by.

So, now I will turn the call over to Inge, and please turn to slide number 3.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us this morning. Overall this was a good quarter 3M. We delivered solid results in the phase of the stronger U.S. dollar and lower factory utilization in a few businesses. Double-digit organic growth in China, Latin America, and Middle East Africa helped us overcome the weakness in Western Europe and Japan. I am pleased that we posted sales growth of around 2% against a backdrop of 0.8% worldwide IPI. Four of our five business groups achieved positive organic sales growth in the quarter. Healthcare posted a 4% gain in organic local currency as did Consumer coming up at very strong Q4. This is the first quarter of reporting based on our new structure and as a result we have clear visibility on all of our business groups. Let me make a comment on the importance of this change to the Electronics, and Energy business group. Here the new structure not only give us better visibility, but also set the stage for better asset utilization in the future. We are seeing early progress today and I know that we will see even more as this team takes shape. On the customer front, Electronics and Energy creates for us a launching pad from which we can quickly introduce a broader range of technologies into the market, and fully capitalize on the outstanding customer relationships 3M has earned in this space. In other words, it creates opportunity. So Q1 gave us many things to be happy about. That said, I want to be clear that we view this quarter in a much longer and much larger context. We will continue to manage 3M for the long term and for the sustained success of the company. That approach is clear when you look at our ongoing investments to improve the business. For example, as we told you last November, we are increasing our investments in research and development and intent to be closer to 6% of sales at the end of the five-year planning period. We continue with capital investments to improve productivity and grow the business. We remain on track for CapEx investments of 1.6 billion to 1.8 billion this year. We are building new strength in emerging markets and in a number of push-forward businesses like Healthcare, we are adding resources and [on the ground] expertise. In summary, we are moving forward on all fronts. We will be pushing hard to take advantage of any recovery in the second half. Note that we have not suggested our expectation on the organic local currency growth which remains at the 2% to 5% for the year. We remain focused on driving growth everywhere. Now, let me take you through a quick look at Q1 results. EPS was $1.61, up slightly year-over-year. Operating margins were 21.6% on GAAP basis, basically flat year-on-year and up sequentially consistent with historical patterns. Four of our five business groups came in about 21%. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, margins were 22%, very strong. Sales were 7.6 billion, up 2% in dollar terms and a record first quarter for us. Organic local currency growth was up 2.1% with Healthcare and Consumer up 4%, industrial up 3% and safety and graphics up 2%. Geographically, Latin America and Canada was up 7%, the United States and Asia Pacific were up 2% and Europe, Middle East and Africa down 1% with Western Europe the main area of challenge. Currency had a negative effect on sales of almost 2% in the quarter and acquisitions added about the same amount. Finally, in the quarter, we returned 1.25 billion of cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. The first quarter validated our previous view about the beginning of this year. As you will recall, we anticipated continued uncertainty and slow growth in the first half of the year, especially in the Electronics space and that is exactly what we saw. Today, as we look back at Q1 and forward through the rest of the year, we see reason to adjust our guidance in the interest of credibility and clarity. Two primary factors of driving this decision. First, macroeconomics; the economy remains uncertain and external forecasts have declined a bit since the year-end, the developed economies in Western Europe and Japan in particular. On a market level, Consumer Electronics continue to present challenges. While there is some indications of an upturn later in the year, our optimists is tempered by the current reality. We expected a challenging start to the year, but in fact market conditions were tougher than we had expected. Second, the stronger U.S. dollar; we previously anticipated that 2013 currency effects will be neutral to sales and earnings. We now expect a 1.5% sales headwind and a $0.05 per share earnings impact for the year. The recognition of these realities leads us to an EPS outlook for the year of $6.60 to $6.85 per share. In the quarter, we announced 3M's 55th annual dividend increase, an increase of 8%. In addition we announced a new share repurchase authorization of $7.5 billion. I will now turn the call over to David for more color on the quarter. David.\nDavid Meline: Thank you, Inge. Let\u2019s begin with slide number six where I will breakdown the first quarter change in sales. Organic local currency growth was 2.1% against a challenging economic backdrop as Inge mentioned. In fact the most recent forecast from global insight calls for a 0.8% worldwide IPI growth in Q1. Volumes contributed 1.7% for growth and selling prices increased 0.4%. Acquisitions added 1.7 points to sales growth in the quarter. Three deals contributed to this growth. Ceradyne, in our industrial business, FS Tech, in safety and graphics and CodeRyte, in Healthcare. Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 1.8 percentage points in the quarter due in large part to a 14% devaluation of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. In dollar terms worldwide sales grew 2% versus the first quarter of 2012. On a geographic basis, Latin America/Canada led the way again this quarter with organic local currency growth of 7.3%, and all five of our businesses posted positive growth in that region. In particular Healthcare, and safety and graphics grew double-digits. In the United States organic local currency growth was 2.3% led by a 5% increase in the Consumer business. We also generated positive growth in industrial, safety and graphics and Healthcare. Asia Pacific grew nearly 2% organically in the first quarter. China, Hong Kong grew by 10% in Q1, and Japan declined by 8%. In EMEA or the combined Europe, Middle East and Africa, first quarter sales declined 0.8% on an organic local currency basis. Healthcare generated low single-digit organic growth EMEA, industrial was flat and the three other businesses declined year-on-year. On a regional basis, we achieved solid organic growth in both central East Europe and Middle, Africa and Western Europe declined 3%. Let\u2019s move to the income statement. Please turn to slide number seven. First quarter sales were $7.6 billion up 2% in dollar terms. Our gross profit percentage was a strong 48% equal to last year\u2019s comparable quarter. SG&A spending rose in line with sales and we increased R&D investments by 5% year-on-year to $430 million. Operating income increased nearly 1% to $1.6 billion. GAAP operating margins were 21.6% down 20 basis points year-on-year included in these results was a 40 basis point headwind from acquisitions therefore underlying margins increased 20 basis points in Q1 to a solid 22%. Profit leverage on organic volume growth added 20 basis points to first quarter operating margin, and lower year-on-year pension in OPEB expense added another 60 basis points. The combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices added 90 basis points to first quarter margins. Lower factory utilization reduced margins by one percentage point largely related to excess inventories in pockets of our Electronics and Energy and industrial businesses. First quarter earnings were $1.61 per share up 1.3% versus the first quarter of 2012. One more item which is not on the chart relates to our corporate and unallocated segment. You will see our first quarter expense in corporate and unallocated of $74 million which is a $64 million improvement year-on-year. Pension and OPEB expense declined which accounts for one half of that improvement. Part of the remainder relates to our ERP project. Now that we are moving from the development stage into deployment more costs are being bored by the businesses rather than corporate. On average this reduced operating margins in each of our businesses by approximately 30 basis points in Q1 with the benefit coming in corporate. We expect this 30 basis point margin impact to each of the businesses to continue throughout 2013. For the full year 2013, we anticipate a total expense in corporate and unallocated of approximately 350 million to 400 million. Now let's turn to cash flow, turn to slide number 8. First quarter operating cash flow rose by 166 million or 20% to nearly $1 billion. Cash flow benefited from 269 million of lower pension and OPEB contributions offset in part by higher tax payments. We invested 324 million in capital expenditures during the first quarter, up 63 million versus first quarter of last year and our projecting 1.61 billion to 1.8 billion for the full year 2013. Free cash flow rose by 103 million or 18% to 670 million. Free cash flow conversion was 59%, a 9 point improvement versus the first quarter of 2012. First quarter is typically our seasonal low point for free cash flow conversion and improves as the year progresses. We have returned 1.25 billion to shareholders in the first quarter comprised of 440 million in cash dividends and 805 million of gross stock repurchases. For the full year, we are now tracking towards 3 billion in gross share repurchases which is at the high end of our previously expected range of 2 billion to 3 billion. Let's review in more depth our first quarter performance on a business-by-business basis, starting with industrial. Please go to slide number 9. First quarter sales were 2.7 billion and industrial up 3% on an organic local currency basis against the tough 7% comp in Q1 of 2012. Most of industrial's businesses grew organically in the first quarter. Aerospace again grew double digits due to a combination of market share gains and strong end-market growth. Industrial adhesives and tapes, which is 3M's largest operating division, had solid organic growth in the quarter as did the personal care business. Organic sales declined in their advanced materials business. Automotive OEM grew 2% organically in the first quarter versus a 1.5% estimated decline in Q1 global auto production. We continue to gain relevance and higher penetration levels in this massive market. On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales in the industrial business rose 6% in Latin America/Canada and 4% in both APAC and in the United States. Organic sales were flat in EMEA with broad-based declines in Western Europe offset by double-digit increases in Central Eastern Europe and in Middle East/Africa. The Ceradyne acquisition added 3.6% to this quarter's growth in industrial. Integration is progressing very well with newly combined technical teams working to identify a number of future growth opportunities. We are injecting lean throughout the operation to drive maximum efficiency and capture value quickly. Profits are ahead of plan while sales were short of plan in the first quarter, largely defense-related whereas sales in the industrial parts of the business are on track. We were encouraged in March when Ceradyne was awarded a $40 million plus order from the U.S. government for Small Arms Protective Inserts armor plates for the government of Afghanistan. First quarter operating income was 576 million and reported margins were 21.5%. Ex-acquisitions, industrial operating margins were 22.5%. Now let's move to safety and graphics, turn to slide 10. First quarter sales were 1.4 billion, up 2.3% on an organic local currency basis. This growth was led by our commercial graphics and architectural markets businesses. We also posted positive organic growth in building and commercial services, personal safety products and roofing granules. The traffic safety and security systems business posted an organic sales decline in the first quarter largely due to weak government funding levels and slow start for the U.S. construction season. We also restructured part of the business in Q1 to improve its competitiveness going forward with associated costs of $4.5 million in the quarter. On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales rose 10% in Latin America, Canada, 4% in Asia-Pacific and 3% in the United States. Organic sales declined 4% in EMEA. The FS Tech acquisition added 2.2% to growth in the quarter and integration efforts are tracking well versus our expectations. This business also secured a major contractor in the quarter for Highway tolling with the Bay Area Transportation Authority, in San Francisco. Operating income in Safety and Graphics increased slightly to $335 million and operating margins were strong 23.7%. Excluding acquisitions, first-quarter operating margins increased 20 basis points to 24.3%. Next up is Healthcare found on slide 11. Healthcare sales totaled $1.3 billion, up 4% on an organic local currency basis. We grew organically across the Healthcare portfolio with particular strength in food safety, critical and chronic care and health information systems. On a geographic basis, Latin America, Canada grew 12%, Asia-Pacific grew 7%, EMEA grew 3% and the U.S. grew by 2%. In developing markets, Healthcare grew 13% on an organic local currency basis with notable strength in India, Middle East, Africa, Brazil, Central East Europe, and Southeast Asia. Developing markets represent one-fourth of our Healthcare sales today and a significant opportunity for tomorrow. In developed markets the business grew 2% organically including 6% in Japan. Operating income rose 1% to $404 million and margins were 30.8%, down 60 basis points year-on-year. Starting January 1 of this year we began absorbing additional costs related to the U.S. medical device tax. The first quarter cost was just over $5 million representing a 40 basis points drag on Q1 worldwide operating margins. For many years our Healthcare business has grown organically each and every quarter with consistently outstanding margins. The business generates tremendous value for customers and for shareholders. Please turn to slide number 12. In Electronics and Energy, sales were $1.3 billion for the quarter, down 2% in organic local currency terms. Growth was slightly positive on the Energy side of the business with strength in electrical markets offset impart by weakness in the telecom and renewable Energy. Electronics which is 60% of the segment, declined about 4% organically. Lower market demand also triggered sizeable inventory reductions by some of our OEM customers and their tier suppliers. As a result, our factory utilization ran lower than we had been expecting and we expect this will persist into the second quarter. From an Electronics and market standpoint, we are expecting a second-half recovery for three primary reasons. One, inventory should be in good shape after Q2. Two, wafer starts and capacity utilization are gradually increasing and three the semiconductor book-to-bill is indicating an upward trend. Operating income in Electronics and Energy declined 16% year-on-year to $196 million and margins declined 2.4 percentage points to 15.3%. Lower volumes and utilization were the primary drivers here. Finally let's review the Consumer business found on slide number 13. Sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion this quarter, up 4% on an organic local currency basis. All of our businesses delivered positive local currency organic growth this quarter with particular strength in the Consumer Healthcare, DIY and home care businesses. From a geographic perspective, organic sales growth was 8% in Asia Pacific and 5% in the U.S. and in Latin America/Canada. EMEA declined 6%. In developing markets, the Consumer business grew 9% in organic local currency in Q1. Consumer is one of our most significant opportunities in developing markets as the middle class is growing rapidly in many of these countries and retail is growing with it. 3M's global capability and local presence around the world gives us a distinct advantage in serving those retail customers. Quarterly operating income was 237 million in Consumer, equal to the first quarter of 2012 and margins were 21.9% for the quarter. Margins declined 40 basis points year-on-year due to higher investments in areas such as ecommerce and design and advertising and merchandising. So that concludes our review of the first quarter. Now, I will turn the call back over to Inge.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, David. Before we go to your questions, I wanted to update you on our progress in several areas. First, portfolio management; on the Q4 call, I referred to actions to consolidate our traffic safety systems and security systems businesses. These restructuring actions were completed in the quarter with associated cost of 4.5 million in the quarter. The point here, of course, is that we are directly addressing the more challenging segments of our portfolio. You should also know that we are increasingly directing a larger percentage of resources towards our Heartland and push-forward businesses. Second, a word on Ceradyne. As David mentioned, the integration of Ceradyne is progressing very well and profits are ahead of plan. I'm excited about the emerging technology synergies from our newly strengthened ceramics platform. Finally, we announced new leadership in the APAC region. Our new area Vice President of Asia-Pacific, Jim Bauman, has successfully managed a wide range of businesses and functions across the company, and has extensive international experience. He's a proven leader. In addition, Kenneth Yu, the energetic longtime head of 3M China will now be applying his impressive business building skills in developing markets around the world. The new leader for 3M China is Donald Chang who most recently led and developed our business in Southeast Asia very successfully. Donald is another great builder of businesses and the ideal new leader to implement our new China plan. So our history of very strong leadership in the APAC region continues. To wrap up, we remain confident looking ahead and are keenly focused on elements within our control; advancing our long-term strategic objectives, driving productivity and improving the business. 3M's unique combination of technology strengths, manufacturing excellence and global capability will enable us to deliver sustainable increases in sales, earnings and cash flow. As I said earlier, we are moving forward on all fronts. Thank you. We will now address your questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Winoker: Thanks and good morning.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Steve.\nSteven Winoker: Just so I understand, how are you thinking about the cadence of, I guess what's it imply 2% to 6% top line growth for the rest of the year. You've mentioned a lot of different dynamics going into that, but if you sort of take us through the quarters and how you're thinking about that? Or just maybe how you're thinking about ramping up, that's be helpful.\nInge Thulin: Sure. So, if you look at how we think the quarters are going to develop, Steve. We think that it's really looking to us more like a first half, second half story right now. So we think that the second quarter specifically in the Energy and Electronics is going to run in a similar fashion to what we saw in the first quarter followed by an improvement in that segment in the second half and then likewise if you look at the other businesses we are observing that we will expect to see some level of improvement in the second half.\nSteven Winoker: Okay. And then could you also maybe just go through, a little bit more of expectations or what you\u2019re seeing in China in terms of stocking levels and liquidity across the different businesses?\nDavid Meline: Yeah, so if you look at China, first of all I\u2019d observe that we saw a 10% organic local currency growth again here in the first quarter and if you take that and separate Electronics and the balance of the business we ran at 8%. So, if you think of base business at 8% in China versus it was at 10% in the fourth quarter of last year, so due pretty steady. And then you saw a decline in the Electronics, and in this case Energy segment including renewable, that caused the total growth in China to go from 16% to 10%. So we\u2019re seeing part of the Electronics issues that I referred to in Energy are based in China as they have a big renewable business there. So, we saw decline in that area which we expect will continue into the second quarter. Whereas in the base businesses, industrial for example and safety and graphics ran at 10% and 11% respectively which is very consistent with what we saw as we finished the year last year.\nInge Thulin: And Steve, this is Inge. I think on the growth piece, the way I think about it is, this is the second quarter now where we have showed growth. And the 2% growth in this quarter based on the IPI growth we feel okay with. Now, that is one of the reason you said 2% to 6%. We\u2019re seeing 2% to 5% in the growth range for the year. So not 2% to 6%, 2% to 5%. And we don\u2019t change that -- we don\u2019t change that because we\u2019re coming off the growth quarter of 2%. Second quarter as David said, look very much like the first quarter. And relative to China, it's good to see we had growth in Q4. We had 10% growth in Q1 coming out of three quarters earlier or basically no growth. Now we believe steel is fragile in China when you look upon external data, and in Q2 it could sidetrack based on growth, right. So, we are optimistic, but we still need to see more evidence of growth coming in that market.\nSteven Winoker: Okay, great. Thanks, I\u2019ll hand it off.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Hi, good morning guys, and thanks for taking my question.\nDavid Meline: Good morning.\nInge Thulin: Good morning.\nScott Davis: Obviously I think you\u2019re going to get a lot of questions just on growth and such and 2% is better -- a lot better than we\u2019re seeing in other companies. But still in that regard when you think about taking the CapEx numbers the way you have, I think it's about a 24% increase quarter-over-quarter. What types of -- maybe you can give us some examples of what types of growth projects are you working on, or what type of end-markets are you expecting that type of, the growth that would justify really ratcheting up spend in a low growth environment?\nInge Thulin: Well, this is Inge. As we said, we\u2019re not changing the guidance for this year relative to the CapEx. And as we all know the CapEx investment is based on long-term growth. So that is why we\u2019re seeing, this is something we would continue and of course there is some markets that are doing better that need more investment and over time some is more of a challenge. And we will like to build out very much close to the market in international as we have talked about earlier. So, without going into specific segments per se you can think about it as we build out our Healthcare business on a global basis, we're doing very well in Healthcare and we're growing well now against \u2013 as David referred to a business where we are growing everywhere both from a business unit perspective [innovation] and on a geographical base. And we need to build that out as we move ahead. That portfolio is basically 75% in developed economies. So, the developing world there is huge upside for us with very attractive margins, so you will probably see over time additional investment in that area. In many cases, in order to be successful in Healthcare, you need to be very local in order to provide that services. The same goes for our Consumer. Consumer is another business we trust that are performing very well in our relative penetration in developing world is much, much lower than in the developed, and specifically with United States. That's another business over time that we will build out. So I think you will see that. And then you have to think about one of the strengths for 3M is our vertical integration in the business model. That means that we will utilize a lot of capacity and places around the world when we build this out. So I will say that think about it as we are not changing it now because we invest for the future and the future we still believe in the plan we have laid out. So it's very favorable for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe: Good morning.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: So, if I look at your project guidance obviously maintained the full year 2 to 5 organic. You got, I guess, a bit of margin expansion, maybe flat margins for the full year, flattish anyway. Given the 1Q performance and since you still have some of these headwinds on utilization, in the second quarter you got (indiscernible) comps coming up in 2Q, 3Q. Are you confident you can maintain that margin for the full year?\nDavid Meline: Yeah, from what we can see now if you look at China, the headwinds and tailwinds that we see for margins for the year, Nigel, certainly as we knew would be the case, we have some positives in terms of margins year-over-year in terms of the pension and OPEB expense. As you would note in the first quarter, we did see continued benefits in our margins from raw materials and pricing. So although we've indicated, we think that in our planning that that would moderate through the year. Certainly it's notable in terms of support of margins. And I think importantly, if you look at the headwinds there, we do have some higher level of integration costs of the acquisitions which we did late last year, so those are hitting more heavily in the first quarter. So that will tend to subside through the year. And then finally utilization and the utilization piece, there's several areas where we have underutilization in the quarter. One of them is in the film making equipment. So if you think about the fact that the renewable Energy business has seen quite a substantial downturn, there's inventory adjustments going on in that space that we think will have the biggest impact here in Q1 and to a certain extent still in Q2. If you think about film making for Electronics, as we mentioned and likewise there, we see inventory adjustments that have been taking place in Q1 which we think by the midyear, those will be completed and so we'll see a better utilization pattern in that area. And then finally, we do mention industrial and you have some specific areas of industrial, some materials that we make that are specialty materials that go into areas like high performance gaskets that are used in automotive products where they have had an inventory correction which now we see that actually has \u2013 will have been completed here by April. So we see those areas which will enable that underutilization to be addressed and that is obviously supportive of margins as we go forward. So in summary, as we entered the year we \u2013 we felt good about our ability to continue to deliver both growth and margins and we continue to believe that's the case.\nNigel Coe: Okay. That's really helpful. And as a follow-on, I just want tackle Scott\u2019s question from a slight different angle. 2.1% organic growth is actually one of the better ones we\u2019ve seen so far. But you mentioned, that growth is coming weaker than expected and that continues in the second quarter and I\u2019m wondering to what extend you\u2019ve managed discretionary cost, a bit more \u2013 a bit tighter than maybe envisaged or whether that\u2019s as an option that you can use as we go into second quarter and second half of the year?\nDavid Meline: Sure. So, what I would say is that as we entered the year, we were quite cautious not the similar to how we operated the business throughout basically in the entire 2012, and so we\u2019ve been managing cost quite cautiously through last year, through the first quarter and frankly we\u2019re in a position now where we will continue to do that until such time that we see our growth picking up more strongly which would support incremental investments in certain areas. At the same time and I think it\u2019s apparent and hopefully you picked up from some of our comments here, we have no intention of backing of the investments that we believe are appropriate for the long-term health of the business. So whether that be building out this emerging and developing market presence, whether that's building at our capabilities with our systems as I talked about which are significant commitments we're making, ramping up the R&D with a particular focus on the innovation area for some of these longer-term breakthroughs. We have the capability do that and we expect to continue there.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Thanks, David.\nDavid Meline: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin: Yes, good morning.\nInge Thulin: Good morning.\nDavid Meline: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Just a question on your outlook cut, so we said that $0.05 is effect, but we have lesser organic growth untouched. So how should I be thinking about the remaining $0.05 cut, is it margin in the Electronics or what is it?\nInge Thulin: Yeah, basically Andrew what we\u2019re signaling with that \u2013 with the overall cut is frankly a level of uncertainty overall in the business that is a little bit higher than we had when we entered the year. So first of all we\u2019ve identified specifically $0.05 due to exchange, but quite honestly to pick a point estimate on that number is a little bit difficult to develop that level of precision, but I think directionally we tried to size that impact for people so they could understand that and the balance of the cut is really reflecting what its turned out to be some areas of incremental weakness in the business here in the first quarter and the first half, particularly related to the areas in Energy and Electronics as we mentioned. I would take it as an indication directionally that we think there is more uncertainty out there. Overall, this year then perhaps we expected as we enter the year.\nAndrew Obin: And just to understand Ceradyne I guess in your waterfall chart, you highlighted margin drag from M&A, you\u2019ve also noted that sequestration was a drag, but you\u2019ve also stated that Ceradyne is performing ahead of your expectations. So, how would I reconcile that?\nInge Thulin: Yeah, so a couple of things. So, if you look at first of all the impact that would impact us from sequestration, first of all if you think about our business overall, we\u2019ve got about 3% of our worldwide sales are related to the U.S. government, that\u2019s at federal, local and state levels. And about 40% of that which is a billion dollars is related to federal. So, we think that the sequestration impact for us would be somewhere in the area of $10 million to $20 million on the year and that would like be here in the second and third quarters, and we're working to offset that with market share gains. Separately, if you look at what's going on with Ceradyne, there's an additional impact. So if you look at what's going on with troop drawdowns that would impact Ceradyne revenue we calculate in the tune of $40 million to $50 million. And so again, we're working on offsetting this contract that we were able to win for 40 million as it relates to body armor for the Afghanis is offsetting that. And secondly we've got a series actually \u2013 on last call, I think there are 27 sales synergy programs that the guys have identified with existing and new products from Ceradyne that we can push through our channels around the world for 3M. So on a couple of separate issues, if you look at the income of Ceradyne as we said, while we've got transition costs that are pulling through the income statement including inventory step-up which still hits us in Q1, we do see that the overall performance on an income basis versus our original acquisition plan for Ceradyne is running ahead of the plan.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you very much.\nDavid Meline: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR. Please proceed with your questions.\nAjay Kejriwal: Thank you. Good morning.\nDavid Meline: Morning.\nAjay Kejriwal: Maybe a clarification on pricing raws, the comment. Do you expect that spread to moderate from here or was that more a comment on pricing? And then also what do you expect on raws, it looks like it was a nice tailwind here?\nDavid Meline: Yeah. So in the quarter we have 0.9% favorable impact on our margin year-over-year, combination of both price and raws as you know, Ajay. And if I just take the pieces, first of all on pricing, as we entered the year, we expected to see relatively minimal benefit from pricing through the year. And in fact Q1 was a little bit better than we expected. As I look at the year on pricing, I would say it's still too early for me to think about adjusting my view on pricing for the year. And if I look at raw materials, likewise, we did benefit in the first quarter from continued tailwinds from lower raw material costs. We had said \u2013 for the year, we thought we would have a plus or minus $0.05 impact as a result of raw materials and quite honestly there it depends very much as to the direction of the economy as to how that one is going to play out.\nAjay Kejriwal: Got it. And then on the underutilization of capacity, we've seen that for a couple of quarters. It looks like it continues into 2Q. I know you talked about a second half pick up, but I guess the question is on the excess capacity. Are you positioning yourself for that uptick or should we except some capacity rationalization here?\nDavid Meline: Yeah, it's a good question, Ajay. So what I'd say is the particular area of that that we've called out here is in the Energy and Electronics business. And what you see happening is that we put those businesses together with a very specific intention to better utilize our assets and more effectively across those segments over time. So if you think about the assets that we use to support our renewable business and our film making business pointed at the Electronics space, by having those under a single umbrella what we're already seeing now is the guys are able to even more adeptly manage that capacity. So in this case, as we see renewable Energy which is going through a very swift downturn, we've already made some adjustments for our capacity plans so that we're repurposing that capacity towards other film making activities. What's also true and an example of that would be we have a growing segment right now in the touch screen area, and so we've already repurposed some capacity that we'd originally expected to be adding, we\u2019ve been able to repurpose existing point about that touch-screen market. So, while we wouldn\u2019t foresee right now any need to rationalize per se what you could see over time which is a typical 3M type model which is okay, we\u2019re repurposing and redirecting capacity towards another business that\u2019s growing when we\u2019ve got one that\u2019s not doing as well in the future.\nAjay Kejriwal: Great. Thank you.\nDavid Meline: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Tusa: Hi, good morning.\nDavid Meline: Good morning, Steve.\nInge Thulin: Good morning.\nStephen Tusa: Hi, on the raw mats can you just maybe clarify what was the year-over-year decline in raw mats; I think it was like 3.5% in the fourth quarter. I think you\u2019ve been giving that in every conference call.\nDavid Meline: Yeah, so that\u2019s right. In last year the raw materials in the second half including the fourth quarter was over 3%, and a little over if you look for the full-year in \u201912 a little over 2%. This first quarter we saw that decline somewhat, but it was still over 2% favorable.\nStephen Tusa: Okay, so it's -- the benefit declined somewhat is what you meant?\nDavid Meline: Yeah, the benefit declined still obviously the \u2026\nStephen Tusa: I got you.\nDavid Meline: Yeah, yeah.\nStephen Tusa: Okay. And then on your comment on Electronics, I guess you said that you expect a similar 2Q to 1Q. Does that mean the similar growth rate or a similar, just you know like basically steady from an absolute perspective?\nDavid Meline: Generally speaking as we look at the Electronics outlook, what do we see? We see a first half; second half phenomenon quite frankly not dissimilar to what we experienced last year. And if I think about that first half, first quarter, second quarter whether it would be growth percentages, whether it would be dollar numbers. We think that it's going to be pretty stable through the first half.\nStephen Tusa: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And sorry, one last question on \u2026\nInge Thulin: And that is very consistent with external data that you see, right? So, I think that\u2019s (indiscernible).\nStephen Tusa: Yeah.\nInge Thulin: And that\u2019s also why we are very cautious, right? So we do not see it yet even if there is some hopes for the future there. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re type of moving through it.\nStephen Tusa: Sure. And then lastly just, you did say corporate was still guided $350 million to $400 million?\nDavid Meline: For the year, that\u2019s correct. Yeah.\nStephen Tusa: Okay, great.\nDavid Meline: So if you look at the quarter it was a little lower because of some things that happened in Q1 of last year, we think for the year $350 million to $400 million.\nStephen Tusa: Okay, so with these dynamics will you guys grow earnings in the second quarter?\nDavid Meline: Certainly we are holding our guidance for growth for earnings for the year, $660 million to $685 million versus $632 last year. We saw a modest growth of income in the first quarter. And quite frankly we\u2019re driving to generate earnings in growth in every growth and that will certainly include the second quarter.\nStephen Tusa: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you, gentlemen. Just a few questions if I could. Just on R&D tax credit; it didn\u2019t appear you guys had any benefit in the quarter. Why is that and is there something that follows subsequently?\nDavid Meline: Yeah. So, Steve on taxes, what's true is actually the R&D, the pick up we got for the deferral of the extenders actually was beneficial to us in the first quarter by 1.7%. So, inside of that first quarter 29.1% we did have a benefit, but what's also true is, if you look at the first quarter the underlying run rate was closer to 31% for the quarter. Typically our highest tax rate is in the first quarter of each year and it moderates through the year. So we expect 29.5% to 30% for the full-year same as we had originally set out and we think it will run fairly stable through the year.\nJeffrey Sprague: Great. And then just on Japan and the yen situation obviously the translation is understandable in a mathematical exercise. Are there any particular export opportunities for you out of Japan that are new or different around the yen weakness that could possibly be a mitigating factor?\nDavid Meline: Yeah. Well, let me make some comment on Japan in a bigger picture. We have \u2013 what is happening in Japan now is something that we in a way could predict quite some time ago, so we have worked on Japan as a business for quite some time. In fact, we started in the beginning of 2009 was when we took a big charge in order to reset our operation there. And since that, we have done a lot of things in order to make sure that we have a better competitive position in Japan, and that have been resetting of the manufacturing footprint. We made an acquisition later as you call, A1 which is into the Consumer business group. And we have started to shift our resources, I would say, to more domestic businesses and for us more domestic will be the Consumer business, the Healthcare business and some of the safety businesses while we have really put emphases on the local manufacturing for automotive specifically and the electronic area per se. So we have been working this for quite some time. And when we look on our result in Japan, the interesting thing for us is we look now in terms of growth for Healthcare for the quarter was over 6%, for Consumer over 7% and so we get traction there. And I think we are very well set for the future in Japan, but it will take some time for us. Now for them, I think when you talked about export and importing in and out of Japan, this will take some time for them to get the plant working. So we hear good things. If you have interacted and worked with Japan over time, you also know this will take some time before [that will] come traction. But generally speaking, we have a good, solid manufacturing footprint in Japan that we can capitalize on already now if it pick up for them in terms of domestic manufacturing which is what they will like by definition, that's what they are driving at. And we have in fact our biggest super hub in the world is in Yamagata in Japan. So we have incredible capabilities there already now to capitalize if they will take off, which we assume they will in terms of domestic manufacturing. I hope that's helped.\nJeffrey Sprague: That does. Thank you. Just one other quick follow-up. David, can you just give us some color on what the share count has been posted in your guide, and the reason I ask is it looks like you had a lot of options, exercises and everything, you actually did more than a quarter of your annual buyback in the first quarter your share count is up sequentially?\nDavid Meline: Yeah. So what I would say, Steve, is the guidance we gave which still looks good for us is the gross buyback of 2 billion to 3 billion for the year. And as I said earlier, we're running as you can see at the high end of that range. And if you look at the net buyback that we called out, I think it was around 1 billion to 1.5 billion for the year. And in fact you're right. We expect that to be towards \u2013 the reassurance towards the high end. In that there was a lot of reissuance this first quarter as we saw record share price for the company. So I don't know how to predict how that's going to play out, but we're continuing to maintain our view that both gross as well as net would be able to achieve the original allocation plan we set out.\nJeffrey Sprague: All right, thank you.\nDavid Meline: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.\nJoseph Ritchie: Good morning, everyone.\nDavid Meline: Morning.\nJoseph Ritchie: So just a clarification on Electronics and Energy, if we're forecasting a similar growth rate for the second quarter, even the low end of your guidance then implies roughly 4% growth in the third and fourth quarter. And so my question is really regarding your confidence around that, and then specifically how that relates to the margins as well, because based on the data we have, it looks like this is the lowest margin quarter we've seen in this business over the last '12, so we'd love to get some color on the trajectory of margins there as well?\nDavid Meline: Sure. Yeah, maybe I can address that, Joe. So if you look at the Electronics and Energy business, a couple of I think relevant kind of context points. One is as we did enter the year we did put the widest range on sales growth of the five sectors. We defined around this business because it was our perception that there was some uncertainty coming into the year. So we\u2019ve got -- if I recall 1% to 6% for the year is the range. We continue to believe that that\u2019s a good range for the segment despite having run below that obviously in the first quarter and we expect to run at a low level in the second. So, we do expect to pick up in the second half which again is, I think not inconsistent with indicators that you would observe elsewhere. In terms of the margin performance for the business; as we kind of set up the year and try to give some indication as how we thought that would develop. We did indicate that we thought E&E for the year would have margins below the Company\u2019s average in fact in the high teens. And we continue to expect that to be true. So, I think you can infer that you\u2019ll see a first half, second half pattern both in growth as well as the consequent margins related to that sector.\nJoseph Ritchie: Okay, great. I guess one other, one follow-up on the margin side. You Healthcare margins have been strong for several quarters. Saw a bit of a down tick on the year-over-year basis. Any color you can provide there on mix would be very helpful.\nDavid Meline: Yeah. So, I guess, what I would say on Healthcare margin likewise we did indicate that we thought this year we would continue to run at similar margin levels as we\u2019ve seen through last year, which has been 30 plus for that sector even though we think maybe long-term view is a little bit below that. You did see it come down a little bit in the quarter year-over-year. Certainly we have identifiable aspects, one being a 0.4% impact of the new device tax on a year-over-year basis. As I mentioned the ERP cost that the businesses are picking up in the first quarter creates an additional 0.3% headwind on our sector margin basis in the first quarter and that will continue. So, if you think about those couple of factors in the context of the overall margin performance, I think you could and you should take a way to view that we continue to believe that the business and the sector is very healthy and will run pretty stable at a high level through the year.\nInge Thulin: And in additional to that, as I made on my comments that we're giving additional investment to some of the push forward businesses and Healthcare is of course \u2026\nDavid Meline: Yeah, that\u2019s right.\nInge Thulin: \u2026 one of them, right. So we're very positive around the outlook for Healthcare. So we\u2019re not only pleased with current performance. In fact, I would say I\u2019m very, very pleased with current performance in Healthcare, but the outlook is also very, very solid for us. So, we are supporting that business down push forward. We\u2019re moving resources very cautiously in order to make sure we get productivity at the same time as we build out. And most of the build out is in developing economies and in international broad base and as you know 75% of our portfolio today is in the developed world. So, as those economies now start to be ready to take on more advanced Healthcare and we have a very good value proposition with our product line broad based I would say in both hospital supply and into orthodontic field as well as Food Safety, so it looks very good for us as we move ahead.\nJoseph Ritchie: Great, thanks. I appreciate the color.\nDavid Meline: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Scott Davis from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Hi, guys. Sorry, I jumped off earlier. I had the phone on mute, my fault.\nDavid Meline: Did you hear the answer though?\nScott Davis: It's not my first quarter I ever listened to calls on, but you think it is. Anyways, I wanted to follow-up on this U.S. medical device tax, and is this somewhat of a timing issue where it just takes you a while to pass this on to your customers or is this something you [you got to eat for] a while until we anniversary it?\nDavid Meline: Yeah, great question, Scott. I guess, we don\u2019t think about it as a pure pass through that you receive cost increase and then you pass the price through to the market. Our view is that we need to look at the offerings that we provide to the market. We need to remain competitive. We need to make sure we manage our cost so that we get a margin for our efforts. So I don't think of them as having such a direct relationship, if you will. And you probably know, in that field specifically, in the health care field is very difficult to pass it on because you have to pass it on then in terms of price increases, right.\nScott Davis: Yeah, I'm sure that can become\u2026\nInge Thulin: So that's tough. And if you look upon the price increases for health care, as you stand into the year, they are able of course to take a little bit higher in the developing world versus in United States. So I think it's correct as David said it's not the (indiscernible) completion. We need however to drive efficiency in the manufacturing operations which I will say in the health care space is very an effective operation for us, right. So one of the reasons why we are successful there, we have very high margins with many things in addition to the value of the product, but it's also very good manufacturing operation. And we, as you know, can always do more and we have been in Six Sigma all over that in order to improve even more. So I think that's how we need to compensate those types of things that we can control.\nScott Davis: No, I understand. And just a real, real quick one. When you look across the company \u2013 it seems you guys get a little bit more stock dilution than the average on old option plans and share offerings and share grants and stuff. Does that start to tail off over time and I guess my point being as your compensation strategies change either to be more cash based and less option based or is it just kind of how it is and so we should just model that type of dilution going forward?\nDavid Meline: No, it's a good question. So a couple of comments. One is if you look at on an overall basis, the historical pattern of the share count, we over the last decade have seen a decline typically on average around 1% annually. And as we look at \u2013 we looked into this next five-year plan that we talked about late last year, our current expectation is that decline will increase somewhat to 1.5% to 2% area going forward. And that's a few things. One is, as we think about how we allocate capital in that direction. And secondly and importantly, there have been some changes to the compensation plans that have been put in place over time. So, for example, in 2007, there was a change in terms of the mix of comp which resulted in the number of options being granted to be reduced in half. So it's a little bit like a longer term phenomenon, but we're now seeing coming to a step down in terms of the overall number of options that are outstanding and have not been reissued the shares yet. And if you look at the first quarter to your comment and quite frankly with the way the stock price performed, we saw a lot of reissuance occur then. So we think that the total outstanding unexercised count of options probably will be cut in half by year-end from where it was as recently as a few years ago.\nScott Davis: That's very helpful. Thanks, guys. Thanks for letting me back in the queue.\nDavid Meline: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research. Please proceed with your questions.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. You covered a lot of ground, just a couple of cleanup questions here.\nDavid Meline: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: First for David, could you update us on the currency hedging that you do have in place and is it fair to say you have got about a half of your yen exposure hedged?\nDavid Meline: Yeah, Deane, thanks for the question. So, yeah, we continue with the same approach that we've had in the past which is on a rolling basis to be hedging 50% of our exposure. So that would certainly include the yen. I think more specifically if I look at the pattern and we compare the impact of this valuation on a year-over-year quarterly basis on what we do see is we called out $0.05 headwind year-over-year now as we move through and that\u2019s concentrated in the first half. So \u2013 and specifically we think we will have a if exchange rates stayed at a similar level to where they ended these recent days, we\u2019d expect to see something that came to $0.03 to $0.04 of that impact, impacting us in Q2.\nDeane Dray: Would that also show up as the \u2013 your mark-to-marketing these currency contracts or where they roll off and it\u2019s a P&L impact?\nDavid Meline: They would show \u2013 what happens is as we have hedge accounting treatment on both the exposure and these matching hedges, so that\u2019s how we\u2019re able to predict as I just described the P&L impact in the second quarter because we know what those unrealized gains and losses are and so if exchange rates are unchanged as we move forward, those contracts will be maturing throughout the year including the second quarter and therefore what I'm referring to is the unrealized gains and losses that we can see on the book right now.\nDeane Dray: That's really helpful. And then just my last question for Inga, I was just hoping you could update us on the portfolio review, we've seen how you gone through the cell fixed combined process with traffic and security being combined, but what else is on that hit list and where do you stand in that review process?\nInge Thulin: Yeah, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t referred them as a hit list, I like most of those businesses as you know all of them make money, all of them are good. But they\u2019re in our word they\u2019re below average relative to performance. We are working our way through there and we \u2013 I will say, we take them business by business. I\u2019ve not announced specific timeline because as you know the business is not conducted in that way. So I will let you know after we have let internally and people know if there are some changes coming there, but the point I can tell you which is very encouraging is that those businesses have improved dramatically the performance in the first quarter versus a quarter ago. So they' top of the target and they are making those targets. So I think that's good. Now the Heartland and push forward, the Heartland divisions had a very good performance in the first quarter. In fact as David said, our biggest division in the Company, industrial adhesives and tapes, had over 7% growth. So, yes fantastic, but that category is doing very well. On push forward, I will say as that is lower leverage for us. We are allocating resources, there is more to come in terms of all the execution of the plan. Point is, we\u2019re very focused on it, we spent a lot of time, they have different measurements and people know it, right, then I think that\u2019s the key element on how we\u2019re driving this forward. So I\u2019m very encouraged around it, because both myself and David and the whole management team believe in this approach in order to improve the portfolio and the performance of the Company. So rest assured, we\u2019re on it and as some announcement is coming you will know its one of the first when we have told people internally.\nDeane Dray: Great. Thank you.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLaurence Alexander: Good morning, just one, quick one. Within your portfolio, do you have any businesses that are more leading indicator businesses for the rest of the portfolio that are not just benefiting from an inventory swing in the channel, but are actually are improving enough to give you confidence on the back half or is it all sort of top down in historical patterns?\nInge Thulin: We probably don\u2019t look upon a product line by product line, we will follow it from the market perspective and I will say that we have a very good customer insight and interaction with customers. So we\u2019re able to follow very well. I think one of the advantages for us is the closeness that we have to \u2013 to our customers and the customer intimacy based on a lot of technologies that we\u2019re working together with them on both on platforms that they\u2019re developing, which is an indicator of when can that be launched, yes or no and also consumables in the industry. So we can have some businesses that we will see and early uptick that it is a good indication. But I will not say we\u2019re not following it that way, we take an approach of following each marketplace if you like and get solid input and then have those dialogues, which is a combination of external facts and data and what our team saw talking about. So that\u2019s the answer to that question.\nLaurence Alexander: Okay. Thank you.\nInge Thulin: Thank you. Excuse me, we ran a little late, but we had a lot of questions and they were good questions. So thanks for those and thanks for joining us today. And I appreciate your listening in. Bye, bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, January 27, 2015. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nMatt Ginter: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to our fourth quarter 2014 business review. Let me kick off with the remainder of our upcoming 2015 earnings call dates. April 23rd, July 23rd and October 22nd. Also, mark your calendars for our next Investor Meeting schedule for December 15th. More details will be available as we get closer to that date. Today\u2019s earnings release and the slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide two. During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Now if you please turn to slide three and I\u2019ll hand off to Inge Thulin, 3M\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. 3M finished the year strong, delivered both record sales and record earnings in the fourth quarter. For the sixth consecutive quarter, we posted organic growth everywhere, in all business groups and in all geographic areas. We did that while expanding margins, increasing profits and investing in our future. I\u2019ll take you through a few numbers. Earnings per share rose to $1.81, up 11.7% year-over-year, sales was $7.7 billion, the fourth quarter record, organic growth companywide was 6%, paced by Safety and Graphics at 9%. Our other four business groups, Healthcare, Electronics and Energy, Industrial and Consumer each grew a solid 6%. We saw organic growth in every geographic area. Both APAC and United States grew 7%. For the United States that marked its strongest growth of the year. Latin America, Canada grew 9%, while Europe, Middle East, Africa grew 3%. Our team is clearly capable of executing in tough environments and fighting through tough headwinds. That includes a stronger U.S. dollar, which reduced fourth quarter sales by more than 4%. Yet, we still delivered good top and bottomline growth. Operating margins remained healthy at 21.5%, an increase of 60 basis points from last year. We again generated strong cash flow with the conversion rate of 144%. This allowed us to invest in the business and continue rewarding shareholders. We returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and in December, we announced the 20% per share increase in our Q1 dividend for 2015 on top of a 35% increase in 2014. Overall, we finished the year strong and I thank entire 3M team for their hard work and execution. Nick will now go through the details. Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide four, where I'll review the components of our fourth quarter sales change. Worldwide organic local currency growth was 6.3%, with volumes up 5.6% and selling prices up 0.7%. This was our strongest quarterly organic growth since Q1 2011. The Treo acquisition added 10 basis points to growth and the stronger dollar reduced sales by 4.4%. All-in, sales rose 2% versus fourth quarter of 2013. Leading the way with 9% organic growth was Latin America, Canada, where Electronics and Energy, Healthcare and Safety and Graphics all grew double digits. Mexico delivered strong double-digit growth in the quarter and Brazil was up slightly. Asia-Pacific grew 6.9%, Safety and Graphics and Healthcare led the way with growth of 12% and 9%, respectively. Organic growth was 9% in Japan or 4% excluding Electronics. China, Hong Kong grew 4% or 6% excluding Electronics. The United States grew 6.6%, led by Industrial at 10%, Healthcare, Consumer and Safety and Graphics all grew 7%. EMEA posted organic growth of 3.3% in the quarter. Central East Europe and Middle East Africa each grew double digits, while West Europe grew 1%. EMEA economies remained soft, but our teams are managing the situation well by growing our market positions and driving continuous productivity across the region. Organic growth within EMEA was positive in four of our by businesses, led by Safety and Graphics and Electronics and Energy. Consumer was down slightly in the quarter. Turn to slide five for the fourth quarter P&L highlights. Fourth quarter sales were $7.7 billion, up 2% year-on-year, with 6% organic growth more than offsetting the stronger dollar. Operating income rose 5% to $1.7 billion and earnings per share rose 12% year-on-year. We increased operating margins by 60 basis points year-on-year, while continuing to invest for the future. I'll now go into more details on our margin improvement. Organic volume leverage added 40 basis points to operating margins and the combination of lower raw material cost and higher selling prices contributed 60 basis points. Selling prices increased year-on-year across many of our businesses supported by technology innovation, brand and strong new product flow. Raw materials were again lower versus last year's comparable quarter, commodity prices declined as we close out Q4 and we expect these tailwinds to accelerate in 2015. Lower pension and OPEB expense added 50 basis points to margins. Strategic investments reduced margins by 80 basis points. This includes increases in disruptive R&D programs, business transformation and ERP costs, and restructuring. During Q4, we took portfolio actions totaling $30 million spread across the United States, Western Europe and Asia-Pacific. Foreign currency exchange reduced margins by 10 basis points and the Treo acquisition was just slightly dilutive. Finally, productivity, resulting in a benefit of 10 basis points to margins year-on-year. Earnings were $1.81 per share, an increase of 12%. Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduced earnings by $0.05 a share, given the broad based strength of the dollar. A lower year-on-year tax rate added a penny to per share earnings and average diluted shares outstanding declined by 5% versus last year's fourth quarter, which added $0.08 to fourth quarter earnings per share. Now I will review cash flow performance on slide #6. Free cash flow was strong in Q4 with 144% conversion versus 131% in last year's fourth quarter. Operating cash flow increased $190 million driven by multiple factors, including higher net income and improved fixed and working capital efficiencies. For the year, we delivered 104% free cash flow conversion. We continue to manage toward a better optimized capital structure by adding balance sheet leverage which we are using for two purposes; first, to invest in our businesses and second, to increase cash returns to shareholders. Full year capital expenditures were $1.5 billion, an important element as we continue to expand the business organically. We paid $2.2 billion to shareholders in cash dividends during 2014, up $486 million versus 2013. As a reminder, on December 16th, we communicated a Q1 2015 dividend increase of 20% per share. And in terms of buybacks, gross share repurchases in 2014 were $5.7 billion, up $440 million year-on-year. Net debt at the end of December was $3.5 billion, up $2.3 billion from year end 2013. Next, I'll go through the results of our business groups starting with industrial on slide seven. Industrial with sales of $2.6 billion delivered strong organic local currency growth of nearly 6% in the quarter. Advanced Materials led the way with double-digit growth. Our Aerospace and Commercial Transportation business generated high single-digit growth and we also saw strong growth in Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Automotive Aftermarket and Auto OEM. All regions delivered growth for Industrial paced again by the U.S. at 10%. The U.S. growth was broad based with notable performances in the three industrial heartland businesses, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Automotive Aftermarket and Abrasives. Latin America/Canada grew 6%, followed by Asia Pacific at 5% and EMEA at 1%. Operating income was $538 million and operating margins were 20.5% down 90 basis points versus last year's all-time Q4 record margin, which was driven by very strong productivity. Investments were higher year-on-year including efforts to better optimize elements of our U.S. supply chain. Fourth quarter 2014 operating margins were in line with normal seasonal trends and for the full year, margins were a solid 21.7%, up 10 basis points versus 2013. Let's now look at Healthcare on slide eight. Healthcare delivered another very good quarter with sales of $1.4 billion in organic growth of over 6%. Every Healthcare business posted positive organic growth. Our large core medical businesses, namely infection prevention and critical and chronic care posted strong growth in the quarter. Health Information Systems and Food Safety, each grew double digits. Healthcare grew organically in all geographic areas led by Latin American/Canada at 12% and Asia Pacific at 9%. The U.S. grew 7% and EMEA grew 3%. In developing markets, Healthcare grew 15% organically marking the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This has been a high priority investment area of ours for some time and these investments are paying off. We continue to build our capability to expand even further into the future. Operating income was $431 million and margins remained strong at 31%, which includes 30 basis points of dilution from the Treo acquisition. Integration efforts are tracking to our expectations and the business continues to exceed sales and profit objectives. Please turn to slide nine. Electronics and Energy continue to build momentum with strong fourth quarter results. Sales were $1.4 billion with organic growth over 6%. Operating income was $257 million and margins increased 2 percentage points year-over-year to 18.7%. Recent portfolio management actions are enhancing our relevance with customers and generating operational efficiencies, which contributed to the growth and margin improvement in the quarter and for the year. Organic local currency sales grew 9% in our electronics related businesses as we continue to see strong and customer demand, enhanced by spec-end wins at several OEMs. In our energy related businesses, organic local currency sales increased 2%. The electrical markets business was up high-single digits while renewable energy and telecom both declined year-on-year. On a geographic basis, organic growth in Electronics and Energy increased 13% in Latin America/Canada, 7% in Asia Pacific and 5% in EMEA. The United States was flat year-on-year. Please turn to slide 10. Fourth quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.4 billion, up a robust 9% organically. Personal Safety grew double digits as we continue to see strong demand for 3M safety solutions in the manufacturing sector. In addition, our respiratory products are selling well in China, where air quality is an ongoing concern. We also saw a pickup in sales related to Ebola in the quarter. We estimate this added approximately $30 million to Q4 sales. Elsewhere in Safety and Graphics, Commercial Solutions grew mid-single digits and organic sales declined slightly in roofing granules and traffic safety and security. Asia-Pacific delivered 12% growth for Safety and Graphics led by personal safety. Growth was 10% in Latin America, Canada, 9% in EMEA and 7% in United States. Operating income was $285 million and operating margins increased 1.6 percentage points to 20.8%. This result was driven by strong organic growth and productivity. I will finish with the Consumer business group found on slide 11. Fourth quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion, with organic growth of nearly 6%. All four businesses in Consumer grew organically, led by a double-digit increase in do-it-yourself. This business continues to win in the marketplace, with leading brands such as Filtrete filters and Command adhesives. We also saw good growth in Consumer, Healthcare, with notable strength in our FUTURO branded health supports. Looking by geography, U.S. organic growth was 7%, boosted by strong holiday selling of Scotch and other 3M branded products. Elsewhere, organic growth was 8% in Latin America, Canada and 5% in Asia-Pacific. EMEA declined 1% year-on-year. Operating income increased 12% to $254 million and margins were 22.5%. Margins rose 2.1 percentage points year-over-year. The combination of strong organic growth, productivity and portfolio prioritization continue to drive efficiencies across the business. That wraps up my review of the quarter. I will hand it back to Inge.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Nick. The fourth quarter was a strong ending to an equally strong year. In 2014, we deliver a record $32 billion in sales. We grew organically in each business group and geographic area, with a good balance between developed and developing markets. We expanded margins and returned a record $7.9 billion to shareholders. We also made good progress on each of our long-term financial objectives, which I laid out at our investor meeting here in St. Paul on November 8, 2012. On earnings-per-share, our target is 9% to 11% average growth. In 2014, we grew EPS at 11.5%. On organic growth, our target is 4% to 6%. We grew 4.9% organically for the year. For return on invested capital, our target is 20%. In 2014, we achieved 22%. Finally, on free cash flow conversion, our target is 100%. For the year, we hit 104%. Driving our success is the scale of our people and the strings of our business model, which includes three key levers. The first is portfolio management. Since 2012, we have realigned our portfolio from six sectors to five business groups and for 40 businesses to 27. In 2014, we combined businesses within three of our business groups, Electronics and Energy, Safety and Graphics and Industrial. All in, we invested $19 million in 2014 in portfolio actions to position us for greater future success. We also look to enhance our portfolio and complement organic growth through M&A. In 2014, we invested $1 billion in acquisitions, including the remaining 25% of our Sumitomo subsidiary, one of 3M's most successful businesses. We also just recently divested our static control business. Active portfolio management is delivering significant benefit for 3M, including greater customer relevance, scale and productivity. Investing in innovation is our second lever. 3M\u2019s primary growth strategy is organic and we strive to develop unique solutions that advance, enhance and improve outcomes for customers. This is why research and development is the heartbeat of our company. In 2014, we invested $1.8 billion in research and development. The strings of our innovation engine helped drive organic growth of nearly 5% in the year. 3M also earned more than 3,000 patents in 2014. In our history, we have now earned more than 100,000 patents globally. The third lever is business transformation. At our investor meeting in December, I laid out our path forward, which includes implementation of global ERP system. This will create a more ideal and efficient 3M, and allow us to better serve customers around the world. Looking at our 2014 performance, I see clear evidence that our playbook includes these three levers, is continuing to drive strong results and value creation. We expect to continue that momentum in 2015. Please turn to slide 13 and I will review our outlook for the year. EPS guidance remains unchanged at $8 to $8.30. Organic growth is still expected to be 3% to 6% in the range. Given the strength in U.S. dollar, we are seeing stronger currency headwinds than expected in December. We now estimate FX to reduce sales by 4% to 5% versus previous guidance of minus 2% to minus 3%. However, as evident in our fourth quarter and full year results, we know how to operate in this environment. In addition, we see input costs lower versus one month ago and our sourcing teams are focused on maximizing those benefits. Our tax rate estimates remain to 28% to 29%, with free cash conversion of 90% to 100%. As you can see, we look forward to another strong and successful year. And with that, I thank you for your attention and we now welcome your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR. Please proceed with your question.\nAjay Kejriwal: Thank you. Good morning.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Ajay.\nAjay Kejriwal: And congratulations. Very nice results. So if I just look at the organic growth, to me it seems like to defining all the negatives macro headlines out there, imagine a lot of what you are seeing, what you are doing there, looks like share gains. But just maybe a couple on that, a big shoe is one, just on your take on what the macro is. What you are seeing by geography and then second, if you are able to identify a path to some of the markets that you are seeing share gains without imaging some of this as share gains in terms of the growth of those markets?\nInge Thulin: Well, thank you. First of all, we are pleased to see the momentum that has build over many quarters now relative to organic local currency growth. And for me specifically why that is very encouraging is that we have made a lot of efforts relative to our organization structure, both in United States but also outside of United States to make sure we are becoming more efficient and effective and more relevant to our customers. And I think that is what we see paying off. And it\u2019s broad-based. And I think that is also related to -- we have a very diversified portfolio as a company. If you think about the five business groups, we are very diversified from a business group perspective and we are very diversified geographically as well, with United States as the biggest geographical area for us and type of a homeland. So it\u2019s very nice to see it all coming together for us. When we looked up on the result for the quarter and then look out to the range for 2015, they\u2019re not changing the range for us. We still believe -- we had a United States, we have a 7% organic growth for the quarter. We have said for '15 3% to 6% in the range. We believe that will be on the high end of that range in my mind as we see it here today doing very, very well. APAC, we had another 7% in the quarter and we have seen businesses coming back a little bit both in China for us and in Southeast Asia. And Japan had a very good year as well for us. But when you look upon that in terms of a range for the year, we believe Asia is 3% to 7%, China is probably 4% to 10%, and Japan a little bit lower. So there is a good market condition for us in order to be able to grow. Latin America, as you saw, came back -- and Latin America and Canada came back this quarter. And we talked about that in the last call where we said see 5% to 8% for them as we roll into the year. And we are still sticking with that. Brazil was slightly positive. Mexico did very, very well. So I think when you look upon North America; U.S., Canada, Mexico has a very good growth momentum for us. And then West Europe, we have -- we\u2019d say, as we said before, a little bit of question mark. We\u2019ve had that in the range of minus 2% to plus 2% for the year. We had growth of 1 percentage point in West Europe -- Europe, Middle East, Africa 3% for the quarter. And as we produce quite a bit in those countries, in terms of export that should not be too negative for us as we move ahead. And as you know, it\u2019s not only that research and development, which is driving organic local currency growth by the way, but also the strategy we\u2019ve had around domestic business model should play for us here. So -- and when you ask about market share and so forth, we have many businesses, so it\u2019s difficult to go through all of them. But when I look upon, it is clear that we take market share in many of our businesses.\nAjay Kejriwal: Excellent. That\u2019s very helpful. And then quick one for Nick. Maybe on the currency exposures, Nick, any color on how you positioned in terms of hedging both natural and through contract? And then maybe any comments on your Swiss franc exposure, please? Thank you.\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Ajay, if we go back to the December 16th earnings outlook meeting, at that time we shared that we expected FX to impact our earnings per share negatively in 2015 by $0.10 to $0.20. With the movement in the foreign exchange rates that we\u2019ve seen in the last month, we now put ourselves right at the high end of that range as that is hurting 3M\u2019s earnings per share by $0.20 year-on-year. Our approach in managing that is really unchanged and it\u2019s on several fronts. First of all, we have a strong management team that knows how to manage through foreign currency exchanges, and that\u2019s been demonstrated time and after time. We also have a hedging strategy where we hedge approximately 50% of our economic or P&L exposure and we hedge that out in the past for 12 months. As we noted in the middle of 2014, we extended that tenor out to 24 months for some of the currencies in developed -- some of the developed countries we are in such as euro and yen. And then operationally, some of the things we do to manage that exposure is looking for opportunities and sources of supply and in some cases, raising prices to offset that currency or pegging our selling prices to a hard currency, such as the U.S. dollar. And that\u2019s much of the story we\u2019ve had in the past and it remains the same in 2015. As far as your question on Switzerland, we have minimal cost exposure there and that will have a immaterial impact on our results in 2015.\nAjay Kejriwal: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis, Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Thanks. Good morning.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Davis: I wanted to follow up on the question on currency a bit. And just how do you guys think about adjusting production or changing how think about your -- how you supply the marketplace, just given the fairly violent swings we\u2019ve had in currency? And like, for example if Canadian dollar is falling as dramatically as it has, does it make sense to produce in that country and export into U.S.? Are there other things that you can do that could help mitigate the impact?\nNick Gangestad: Scott, that\u2019s a good and interesting question. And I will just put it in a short-term and long-term perspective. From a short-term perspective, this isn\u2019t the type of thing that week to week, month to month that we fluctuate are production from one part of the world to the next. Our number one focus is how are we going to serve our customers locally? And then from there we then focus on, are there opportunities? So I will use the eurozone right now where we have a European Center of Excellence, that\u2019s looking at what kind of opportunities do we have with the current FX rates on the euro. Looking at our material costs, are there potentials to renegotiate purchase prices, material localization? Does it create new opportunities for us to source something from a new supplier at a different FX exchange rate to our advantage? In times like this, it also causes to manage our spending, probably more tightly in some parts of the world. And then to what you\u2019re talking, that\u2019s a little longer-term, looking at regional sales sufficiency. We do have manufacturing capability to manufacture products that has spread around the world, and then we use movements like this to look for those opportunities. That\u2019s going on constantly, and it\u2019s a heightened case for us right now, Scott.\nScott Davis: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then when you look at our CapEx budget for 2015, I am just trying to get a sense of where the priorities, where do you -- where are you investing? And once -- I mean, this question asked a couple years ago would have been all China or I mean other emerging markets. And has that shifted at all back to more developing nations? Or just give us a sense of, maybe think about the priorities for the 1.5 billion where you\u2019re going to spend money?\nNick Gangestad: Scott, I characterize our priorities as fairly balanced and not changing in 2015. And there is couple dimensions to talk about that. First of all, we tried to have a nice balance of where we are investing in growth, expanding our capabilities and our capacity to meet local customer requirements. Second, we are also investing in increasing our competitiveness, often that\u2019s in renewal or enhancements to existing manufacturing sites we have. And then third, there are some strategic investments we\u2019re making where it might be expanding in a new geography or one of our significant strategic investments is our investment in business transformation and ERP. Geographically, we continue to see a nice balance of where that's going. It\u2019s not skewing more to developing markets, right now. In 2015, we see it bounce very close to what we've had in the last two year.\nScott Davis: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Okay. Great job, guys. Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nNick Gangestad: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin: Hi, guys. Good morning.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Andrew.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Just a question, in terms of restructuring in the quarter, it seems like strategic investments reaccelerated versus the third quarter. So the first thing, can you just -- you mentioned $30 million for restructuring in Q4, what was the 3Q number if you could remind us? And then, if you could just talk about the balance of strategic investments and restructuring versus the benefit, because last quarter they turned positive and we're back to being negative. Just how should I think about the benefits of restructuring going forward?\nNick Gangestad: Yeah. Andrew, a couple points on that. Yes, our $30 million that was restructuring portfolio actions that we took in a few of our business, in electronics, in energy, safety and graphics, and healthcare. And as I said earlier spread geographically, but most heavily concentrated in Western Europe for a total of $30 million. And that was very close to zero in Q3 of 2014. So an up-tick from the level we saw one quarter before. Returns that we see on this will vary by geography. The restructuring actions we\u2019re taking in United States we see paybacks occurring within the next calendar year or less than 12 months. The paybacks that we see on our Western European portfolio actions typically take longer, and we see paybacks that can take two or three years on those investments.\nAndrew Obin: But just as we're thinking about the paybacks, right, because obviously you've been reinvesting for a couple of years now. And as I said, just going back last quarter you had a pretty positive tailwind from the benefits. And this quarter I think it was relatively flat. How should I think about that going forward?\nNick Gangestad: Yeah. Thinking about that going forward Andrew, part of what I laid out for 2015 is that we\u2019re expecting $0.10 to $0.20 of productivity benefits and part of our margin expansion in 2015 versus 2014, a portion of that productivity benefit. And I will roughly attribute one-third of that productivity benefit is coming from past restructuring activities that 3M is invested in.\nAndrew Obin: Got you. That's great. And just a small follow-up. What's your assumption for oil price, that's baked into your forecast for the year?\nNick Gangestad: Andrew, for the year, we are estimating that oil prices are going to average $50 a barrel. And while you're on the subject in the December 16th earnings call part of my outlook at that time was that raw materials we expected to benefit, our earnings per share in 2015 by $0.15 to $0.25. With our latest assumption on oil prices, we\u2019re now right at the high end of that estimate. We\u2019re still in the estimate but now at the very high end of it.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you very much.\nNick Gangestad: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: And a nice quarter.\nNick Gangestad: Thank you.\nJoe Ritchie: Just my first question is on price cost. Nick, you've been talking for a while that we're going to start to see a lower benefit from price cost, and historically over the past year you've done closer to about 100 basis points, and you\u2019ve got 60 basis points this quarter. Could you just talk to us a little bit about the dynamic this quarter, was it because you lap some pricing increases, and how should we think about pricing in '15?\nNick Gangestad: Yeah. Joe, yes it did come through almost exactly like as we were describing. The components of what we\u2019re seen there, we did have significant price growth in 2013 and there is a bit of lapping occurring there. We do continue to still see strength of the 3M product innovation flow, the strength of the 3M brand, and the impact that has on pricing. FX in the first part of 2014 had a more pronounced impact on our pricing growth and that abated some in the fourth quarter. Party of the mix of where the FX movements have been occurring, it\u2019s much more in developed markets in currency such as the Europe. And then going forward, we continue to expect low price growth of all of our organic growth, the 3% to 6% that we\u2019re projecting for 2015. We\u2019re expecting the vast majority of that to be in volume growth and not price growth.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And maybe one follow-up for Inge. Inge, you mentioned earlier on M&A, you mentioned Sumitomo. I was just wondering whether the environment recently with the evaluations coming down in certain end markets, whether things have gotten anymore attractive in terms of the pipeline from an M&A standpoint.\nInge Thulin: Are you talking overall M&A pipeline? You don\u2019t talk specifically Japan but you talk overall.\nJoe Ritchie: Right now, overall.\nInge Thulin: Overall, yes, our pipeline is robust and we are working at constantly. And as I said earlier, I feel that we\u2019re on a much better position now to really identify the most attractive pieces for us as we have better -- much better understanding today versus two, three years ago of positions in our portfolio in between the different businesses. And also when we now have identified the real fundamental strengths of 3M which is for us, which around the technology, manufacturing a global capability and brand equity. So we say that we are in a much better position today in order to be able to look upon them and identify them et cetera. So that's good. And we have as I said earlier from my move from a more of a bottom-up approach, we have complement that that with the top-down approach as well in order to make sure that we can identify and find something that can be used more broad based in the organization. Ceradyne was probably the first one around those acquisitions, and is working out very well and again had a very good quarter for us at this quarter end. So think about it in that respect, we find that that\u2019s very attractive with us, that there is both sustainable end market that is interesting but also some technology for us that we can expand into our auto platforms which is an important thing for us. And technology innovation for us is important for us in order to create more value for customers and for our shareholder. So it\u2019s an important element.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks for the color and nice quarter.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Winoker: Thanks, and good morning all. I wondered if we could dig in a little more in that pricing point, specifically around your ability to price versus translation and other currency effects competitively in Europe and Latin America. So to what extent is there a lag here and those pricing actions being taken? So when I looked at that 1.4% on price in EMEA and 3% Latin America, Canada versus minus 9.79%, should we count on that catching up a bit in the next quarter or two? And then Inge, just strategically as you think about this going forward, any competitive dynamics that change as a result of that currency fluctuation? \nNick Gangestad: Yeah, Steven, in the past you\u2019ve witnessed for price growth when it\u2019s driven by FX reductions in the last couple of years primarily in developing markets, you\u2019ve seen a pretty significant amount of that recaptured in price. If I were you modeling, I would not be modeling that same ratio of pricing actions to offset that. The businesses are out there engaged, working on where the opportunities are for offsetting some of that FX in price but the ratios that we've experienced in the past are not going to be the same as what we're going to see in Western Europe. There are some parts of EMEA though where we are changing our pricing to be U.S. dollar priced, which will bolster our price growth there. But the guidance I gave Steve is tamper that ratio that you\u2019ve historically seen.\nInge Thulin: Yeah, and coming back Steve, if I may on your question. I think, one important thing is to just recognize the investments that we have done over years under the umbrella of domestic demand and domestic manufacturing, which is helping you a lot relative to issues like this. I think the other thing is the technology innovation will by definition in most businesses help you. And the way we look upon all business, we have one that I will describe as a design and spec-end business and then you have one on consumables. On design and spec-end businesses where you provide technology innovation that is coming on platforms, that's a big advantage for us because the technology is there and in most cases, we are able to produce locally. So another thing is over one-third of our businesses in United States. And as I\u2019ve said before, 3M never left United States, we stayed here. In fact, I\u2019ve also invested this year in more capacity specifically, in our Healthcare business. So I see in terms of some competitive moves -- from time to time that can be in my view in smaller countries around the world, maybe some push in the low end of the portfolio from some local competitors. But I think, that\u2019s not what 3M is all about based on our business model, generally speaking. So we should be able to hold in there. And as I said, probably gain market share as we move ahead, like I am generally speaking very, very pleased with execution relative to our commercialization capabilities in the company. And I\u2019m very pleased to see how that momentum had built now for five, six quarters, slightly stronger every quarter, so that's good.\nSteven Winoker: 3M use to quote a percentage of regional production for regional consumption or supply, which you refer to several times now to this call. You have a sense for how high that is these days?\nInge Thulin: It depends on the region by definition and it\u2019s slightly higher in West Europe and United States versus in APAC and Central East Europe and Middle East Africa. But we are pushing that I would say, as we move ahead, but also being thoughtful relative, so we do not build too much capacity and duplicate efforts. So it\u2019s I think have been a big effort and as you remember that we talked in the past about slightly complicated supply chain operation. And as maybe I said to many of you is that that\u2019s a big thing now that we go after as we move into \u201815 as to make sure we get much more streamlined supply chain and better cost of good sold and better inventory management and so forth.\nSteven Winoker: And was wage inflation, anything unusual in the quarter at all and then when you did a productivity 10 basis point number, I assume that net of wage inflation?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. That is net of wage. And no, we're not seeing anything unusual in wage inflation or wage pressures, very normal trends for us.\nSteven Winoker: Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Good morning, guys.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Shannon.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Hey. Can you just dig a little bit more into this U.S. Industrial strength? You said it was up 10% in the quarter and I think, the -- you mentioned the Safety business was also strong in manufacturing? What\u2019s sort of strongest thing you're seeing there and your confidence level what\u2019s -- where you see changing?\nInge Thulin: Well, yeah, so first of all, the two businesses as you talked about Industrial by definition, core Industrial and Personal Safety, they often growing hand by hand, right. So we saw good growth there. So for us, we saw Aerospace and Transportation in high single-digit growth and if you take the core business, which is, I will categorize as adhesives and tape and abrasives, we saw very good growth. We saw adhesives and tape that this is our biggest division. We saw that at 8% growth in the quarter and we also saw automotive at 5%. So I would say it was broad-based in United States in those businesses. And as I said earlier, you think about at for us as a design and spec-in, where you have coming in on products and platforms, and then you have the consumables where you\u2019re using our products in your manufacturing operation and so forth. So I would say it was broad-based and when I looked upon the growth for the businesses in Industrial, they -- we were around 5 plus for every business in United State. So very strong and as you said, Personal Safety was even higher than that. So it looks good for us and the team is executing well. So it\u2019s good.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Okay. And then, 3M is pretty interesting view into how the impact of lower oil prices is actually going to impact, demand in the economy and sort of the positives and the negatives of that? Do you have any kind of early read on that or anything your sense in your businesses or seem talking your business leaders or a view of how this might play out?\nNick Gangestad: Yeah. Shannon, the impact on the business and our ability to organic growth, I really don't have any insight to share there of anything changing in the market as a result. The primary impact we are seeing is what's coming out us with commodity prices. And what we\u2019ve been seen in what we\u2019re paying for commodities so far this year and why I'm saying that we\u2019re now on the high-end of our $0.15 to $0.25 benefit from raw material prices.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Okay. Do you have any sense sort of an early pickup and better consumer spending in your businesses because consumers have more discretionary?\nNick Gangestad: Yeah. We haven't seen that yet, Shannon.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: My first question was on R&D and Inge, I know that there is a plan to ramp up R&D to a 6% level? But it didn\u2019t look like it started to happen this quarter, actually declined year-over-year? I know it probably shouldn\u2019t be a linear process, but maybe if you could comment on R&D spending over the next couple of quarters?\nInge Thulin: Yeah. Well, first of all, it\u2019s -- we see improved productivity coming out of the laboratories, which we are very pleased about. If I give you some facts relative to that additional 5% of -- from 5.5% to 6% increase in spending is around disruptive technologies and this is now going into the third year. So, overall, we have 30 programs that are funded, 19 of them came on in 2013, seven in 2014 and we are looking for another four here in 2015. So the investment of it over the years have been 82 in \u201914 and was 40 in \u201813 and we plan for another 70 plus this year. Seven of the programs are now in early stage of commercialization and that's in Healthcare, Infrastructure and Transportation, Electronics and Consumer markets. So we had sales from those investments in 2014 for around $150 million and we are looking, as I said, in New York for around $250 million as we go ahead. So we will continue to invest and our -- as we have talked about in the past, our new product Vitality Index is robust 32%, 33%, that's a good place for us to be and we are continuing to invest in. Now that -- it's -- the investment going into it is important, but equally important for me is to see the outcome. And I'm pleased by that because as you see, we are running in the middle of a range of 4 to 6. Now, we are running around 5, in fact, this quarter on the high-end of that range so. And that is clear evidence that new programs have been introduced as we go. And we had quite a number of new products introduced in 2014, have hit the market. So it was $10.4 billion of new products hitting the market from 3M 2014. So, I'm not -- we continue to invest, but they are not excluded from productivity improvements.\nDeane Dray: That\u2019s great color. And then my second question, I want to go back to the hedging practices to Nick for a moment. And it was interesting to hear that your response has been to extend the duration of your hedges from 12 months to 24 months. And we are seeing companies in both new hedging practices. We saw GE doing that. Honeywell has done that .So you\u2019ve extended the duration. But I was curious why would you not increase the percent of your current hedges from 50%, or let's say, 75%? Did you look at that what the costs are there?\nNick Gangestad: Yeah. Dean thanks for asking and clarifying a question on that. One of the constraints or governs our ability to hedge is qualifying for hedge accounting treatment. And if we go over a 50% in most cases, we would then be subject to mark-to-market accounting and therefore defeat the purpose of what we're trying to do with our hedging processing. In fact, we\u2019d probably add more volatility if we did that. So that's the upper limit constraint on what we can. And part of our approach, if I go back over a decade, is not to eliminate all the risks there. Our approach is to give the business some time to react and adjust to the changing business conditions and that's consistent with our 50% strategy.\nDeane Dray: Great. Nick, that clarification was real helpful. We would rather not see you go through the currency mark-to-market gyrations. So we\u2019ll live with the 50% then. Thanks.\nNick Gangestad: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Tusa: Hey. Good morning.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: What you guys seeing in Europe, specifically maybe in some of your Industrial verticals?\nInge Thulin: Well. First of all it\u2019s -- I would say, as you saw relative to the growth for the quarter for us in Europe, it was okay I would say. And I would say that specifically, we had a good growth in some of the businesses that specific around automotive and so forth, which is a big portion in Europe. We also saw very good growth in personal safety, which is very much related into the Industrial space. So it\u2019s still a slow growth, generally speaking over there. But I think personally with the trend relative to the currency, that we would see more export coming out of Europe. And our position in Europe is very strong. I would say in all Industrial position and in Healthcare. We are weaker in the Consumer space in Europe based on historical position. So, I think as export will increase as we go, I think that we\u2019ll have 3M as we go ahead. I think the other thing relative to Europe is to say that we have been on West Europe specifically now for many years. I think four years relative to the structure over there. So, I think one of the thing that -- sometime it\u2019s difficult to predict exactly the outcome of the growth. But I think one thing that you need to do as an enterprise is to address your structure constantly. And as we have talked about earlier, we have addressed that big time in terms of going from a subsidiary structure to regional structure and taking all out, quite a bit of layers and management into organization, while we kept the front-end of the organization in terms of execution. So let\u2019s say, I think we are in a good place in Europe, but it\u2019s not an easy environment as we all know. But there is no disadvantage for us by definition. And as I said, the portfolio for us is strong in Industrial, Healthcare and Safety and Graphics. Those businesses are the strongest for us, our Electronic and Energy and Consumer businesses as a smaller big mix in Europe. And I would say specifically Consumer, Electronics is very small in Europe. We are strong in energy. Consumer retail is by definition a small portion for us so, and I think in that segment also where you will see a lot of pressure maybe as we go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Thanks. Just one last question. I know this is a dumb question for you guys. But is there any quantification of what you guys sell in and around the oil and gas markets? Is there any quantification of whether it's 2% to 3%, or do you guys have visibility on what you may sell in and around those markets, whether it\u2019s adhesives or anything like that\u2019s going to those economies?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. Steve, yeah, we do look at this and approximately 3% of our revenue is into the oil and gas industry.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Great. Thank you. Very helpful.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Jermaine Brown of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nJermaine Brown: Hi. Good morning, gentlemen.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Jermaine.\nJermaine Brown: Most of my questions have already been answered already. So real quick. Over the course of the year, how do you expect the raw material tailwinds to flow through your income statement given the moving crude oil prices?\nNick Gangestad: Yeah. With the move, we expect it to be mostly balanced through the year. If there's going to be a slight bias, it\u2019s going to be slightly backend loaded but not markedly so.\nJermaine Brown: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.\nMatt Ginter: Well, thanks for joining us and what I know is a very busy earnings day. I appreciate your participation. We look forward to seeing you during the year. Good bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

(Operator instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, October 23, 2014. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nMatt Ginter: Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2014 business review. You\u2019ll see a list of upcoming events and dates on Slide 2. We will hold our next investor meeting on Tuesday, December 16th at the Grant Hyatt Hotel in New York City. The meeting will begin at 8 am and conclude around noon. Invitations will be sent today, so please RSVP as soon as possible. Also, make note of our earnings call dates for 2015, scheduled for January 27th, April 23rd, July 23rd and October 22nd. Today\u2019s earnings release and the slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. If you please turn to Slide 4, and I\u2019ll hand off to Inge Thulin, 3M\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today. The third quarter for 3M was marked by steady execution and strong growth delivered in a mixed global economic environment. For the fifth consecutive quarter, we posted organic growth in all business groups and all geographic areas. Our team\u2019s execution also produced raising margins and the highest quarterly sales in 3M history. At the same time, we made investments in research and development and our commercialization capabilities to ensure long term success. Let me take you through a few highlights of the quarter. Earnings rose to $1.98 per share, up 11.2% year-over-year. Sales were $8.1 billion, a 3M record. Organic growth was 4% companywide on top of 6% growth in last year\u2019s third quarter. Leading the way with 5% growth was Healthcare, a business that is pioneering medical advancements in emergency rooms, hospitals and dental clinics around the world. Electronics and Energy grew a solid 4% with particular strength in our electronics business. Industrial also grew 4% with special encouraging growth in the United States. Consumer delivered 3% growth, including significant gains in our do-it-yourself business. Safety and Graphics also grew 3% led by our personal safety division. Organic growth was positive across all geographic areas paced by the United States at 6% and Asia Pacific at 5%. I\u2019m pleased that operating margins are very robust. Margins rose to 23%, up 1.4 percentage points year-on-year. All business groups delivered margins greater than 22%, another company first. Margin expansion combined with 4% organic growth is further evidence our portfolio management actions are delivering hard results. Free cash flow was strong in the third quarter, allowing us to deploy more resources to enhance the values of our businesses. And we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders to dividends and share repurchases. On September 1st, 3M also completed acquisition of the remaining 25% of our Sumitomo subsidiary at the price of $865 million. And three weeks ago, I was in Japan to visit our team along with our biggest customers. We discussed the growth opportunities in the market around infrastructure, healthcare, consumer and other areas. Our 3M Japan team is excited to grow into an even bigger and more profitable enterprise. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with our third quarter performance. We executed well and delivered strong growth across the company. Nick will now take you through the details. Nick.\nNick Gangestad: Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 5 where I\u2019ll review the third quarter income statement. Q3 was a strong quarter and we are on track to deliver the sales and income targets that we communicated entering the year. The company continues to operate well with a good balance of growth, margins and cash generation. Third quarter sales were an all-time record, $8.1 billion, an increase of 3% year-on-year with 4% organic growth more than offsetting the stronger U.S. dollar. Operating income rose 9% to $1.9 billion and earnings per share rose 11% year-on-year. We generated good productivity in Q3 and increased operating margins by 1.4 percentage points while investing in important programs for the future. I\u2019ll dig a bit deeper into the components of the third quarter margin improvement. Organic volume leverage added 20 basis points to third quarter operating margins. And the combination of lower raw material cost and higher selling prices contributed 80 basis points year-on-year. Underlying selling prices remained firm across many of our businesses supported by technology innovation and strong new product flow. Raw materials were again lower versus last year\u2019s comparable quarter. Commodity prices remained steady and our sourcing teams continue to create new opportunities to reduce cost across the globe. Lower pension and OPEB expense added 50 basis points to third quarter margins. Strategic investments reduced third quarter margins by 40 basis points. This includes increases in new disruptive R&D programs, business transformation and ERP costs and restructuring. Foreign exchange impacts reduced margins by 10 basis points and the Treo acquisition was just slightly dilutive to third quarter margins as we integrate that business. Inge also mentioned that we acquired the remaining 25% minority equity position in Sumitomo 3M on September 1st. But because that subsidiary was already being fully consolidated in our results, it had no impact on operating margins. It was, however, $0.01 accretive to earnings per share in the third quarter. Finally, productivity and other items added an additional 50 basis points to margin year-on-year. Earnings were $1.98 per share, an increase of 11%. Foreign currency impacts reduced earnings by $0.02 a share in Q3, given the broad based strength of the U.S. dollar and the higher tax rate reduced earnings by $0.08 per share. Average diluted shares outstanding declined by 5% versus last year\u2019s third quarter which added $0.10 to third quarter earnings per share. Slide 6 outlines the details of our third quarter sales change. Worldwide organic local currency growth was 3.9% with volumes up 3.2% and selling prices up 0.7%. We\u2019ve now achieved 20 consecutive quarters of positive organic sales growth. The Treo acquisition added 10 basis points to sales growth and the stronger U.S. dollar reduced third quarter sales by 1.2%. On an all-in basis, sales rose 2.8% versus the third quarter of 2013. Organic local currency sales growth was positive across all major geographic areas, making this the sixth consecutive quarter that we have done so. The United States outpaced all geographic regions in the third quarter with organic local currency growth of 6%. U.S. growth was led by Industrial at 8%, Safety and Graphics at 7% and Healthcare at 6%. Asia Pacific organic growth was 4.9% in Q3. Healthcare and Electronics and Energy led the way with growth of 9% and 7% respectively. Organic local currency growth was 7% in Japan or 3% excluding electronics. China, Hong Kong grew 4% organically in Q3 or 3% excluding electronics against a challenging double-digit comp growth in last year\u2019s third quarter. EMEA posted organic local currency growth of 0.8% in the third quarter. Central/East Europe and Middle East/Africa each grew in the mid single-digits while West Europe declined 0.5%. While we have seen pockets of slowing in some West European countries, our teams there are executing well in the face of some economic headwinds. Organic growth within EMEA was positive in Healthcare, Safety and Graphics and Industrial, but declined in both Electronics and Energy and Consumer. Finally, Latin America/Canada grew 0.4% organically with Healthcare leading the growth. Mexico generated double-digit organic growth and Brazil was up mid single-digits. Venezuela remains challenging but our team is managing through the situation well and the currency risks are under good control. Revenue was down in the third quarter in Venezuela which reduced organic growth across Latin America/Canada by 6 percentage points. Now let\u2019s turn to cash flow. Turn to Slide #7. Free cash flow was strong in Q3 with 103% conversion versus 61% in last year\u2019s comparable quarter. Operating cash flow increased $560 million driven by multiple factors, including higher net income, lower working capital, lower pension contributions and lower cash taxes. Year-to-date is a similar story with 91% free cash flow conversion versus 76% in 2013. We expect full-year conversion will be in the range of 95% to 100%, up from 90% to 100% previously. Full-year capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, which is consistent with our prior view. We continue to manage the company towards a better optimized capital structure. Our plan calls for additional balance sheet leverage which we\u2019ll use for two purposes. One, to expand our businesses and two, to increase cash returns to shareholders. We are executing on that plan in 2014 and beyond. For example, as Inge mentioned, on September 1st, we closed on the acquisition of the remaining 25% non-controlling interest in Sumitomo 3M for approximately $865 million. We have also paid $1.7 billion to shareholders in the form of cash dividends during the first three quarters of 2014, up $365 million versus 2013. And in terms of buybacks, year-to-date growth repurchases were $4.4 billion, up $835 million year-on-year. We now expect full-year 2014 repurchases will be in the range of $5.5 billion to $6 billion versus a previous expected range of $4.5 billion to $5 billion. Net debt at September month end was $3.5 billion, up $2.3 billion versus year end 2013 due to both higher debt levels and lower cash balances. Next, I\u2019ll go through the results for each of our business groups starting with the largest business \u2013 Industrial. Please go to Slide #8. We had a good third quarter in Industrial with sales of $2.8 billion and 4.2% organic local currency growth. This strength was broad based as nearly all businesses posted positive organic growth. Our aerospace and commercial transportation business generated double-digit organic local currency growth and we also saw a strong growth in 3M purification, automotive OEM, advanced materials and industrial adhesives and tapes. The United States was by far the fastest growing region of the world for Industrial with 8% organic growth in the quarter. Again, U.S. growth was broad based with notable performances in three of our heartland businesses, namely automotive aftermarket, abrasives and industrial adhesives and tapes, along with aerospace and commercial transpiration and automotive OEM. Elsewhere around the world, organic local currency growth was 4% in Asia Pacific, 1% in EMEA, while Latin America/Canada declined 1%. Industrial\u2019s organic growth continues to outpace that of worldwide industrial production and it\u2019s clear we are taking share in some key industries. Automotive OEM is a good example where 3M\u2019s 7% organic growth in the third quarter was three times the rate of global automotive builds. Third quarter operating income industrial was $660 million and operating margins were 22.2%, up a full point versus the third quarter of 2013 and in line with recent quarterly trends. Let\u2019s now look at Safety and Graphics found on Slide 9. Third quarter sales in this business were $1.4 billion, up 3% on an organic local currency basis. Organic growth was led by our personal safety business along with traffic safety and security systems. Sales declined organically in roofing granules. As with Industrial, the United States led all the geographic regions with 7% organic local currency sales growth in the quarter. Personal safety products and traffic safety and security systems again led the way. Organic growth was 3% in EMEA, flat in Latin America/Canada and declined 1% in Asia Pacific. Operating income in Safety and Graphics was $340 million and operating margins increased 1.6 percentage points to 23.5%. Strong operating leverage, along with the benefits from recent portfolio actions helped drive the increase. Please go to Slide 10. Our Electronics and Energy business continue to post solid results in the third quarter. Sales were $1.5 billion and organic local currency growth was 4%. Operating income was $338 million and margins rose 1.8 percentage points to 22.5%. Organic local currency sales grew 8% on the electronics side of the business due to solid end customer demand combined with successful spec in [ph] wins at several OEMS. In energy, organic local currency sales declined 2% in the third quarter. The electrical markets business was flat in the quarter while telecom and renewable energy both declined year-on-year. On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales increased 7% in Asia Pacific, 3% in United States and were up slightly in Latin America/Canada. EMEA declined by 6% in the quarter. We have a strong group of businesses in Electronics and Energy, strengthened further in the past couple of years via multiple actions to better align to our customers and improve the portfolio. The team continues to execute well as evidenced by the growth and margin improvements seen throughout the first nine months of this year. Please turn to Slide 11. Healthcare had another very good quarter with sales of $1.4 billion, an organic sales growth of 5.4%. Every healthcare business posted positive organic local currency sales growth led by double-digit performances in both drug delivery and health information systems. We also grew organically in all major geographies with Asia Pacific up 9%, the U.S. and Latin America/Canada up 6% and EMEA up 3%. Healthcare\u2019s third quarter organic sales growth was 11% in developing markets, marking the 11th consecutive quarter that we\u2019ve grown at 10% or higher. Developing markets represent substantial opportunities for 3M and we continue to build our capability to capitalize on future opportunities. Third quarter operating income in Healthcare was $432 million and margins were strong at 31%, including some modest dilution from Treo which was acquired on April 1st of this year. Integration efforts are tracking to our expectations and the business is exceeding its sales and profit objectives. Last year\u2019s third quarter margin of 32.1% included a 1.4 percentage point benefit from a gain on the sale of a non-strategic asset. If I adjust for this year\u2019s acquisition and last year\u2019s one-time gain, margins increased 70 basis points year-on-year. Healthcare is a strong set of businesses and one of our highest investment priorities. Over the past several years, we\u2019ve made substantial improved investments to bolster our healthcare businesses in China, Germany, Poland, Thailand, India, the United Kingdom and the United States. Last week, we announced a $58 million capacity expansion in the United States to support growing demand for 3M medical tapes, dressings, surgical drapes and other wound care products. I\u2019ll wrap up with the consumer business group found on Slide #12. Third quarter sales in the consumer business group were $1.2 billion with organic local currency growth of 3%. Consumer is home to several of 3M\u2019s best known power brands such as Post-it, Scotch and Scotch-Brite. For the retail consumer, these are household names, but in fact, many other 3M brands are also enjoying success in the marketplace. Take for example our Filtrete brand filters which significantly improve air quality in the home. This business grew double-digits organically in the third quarter as we gained share in the U.S. and expanded the category globally. Our Command brand adhesives also generated double-digit organic growth in the quarter boosted by a strong back-to-college season. College dormitories are a growing market for 3M Command solutions because our products eliminate the need to pound nails into walls when hanging pictures, decorations or other items. Filtrete and Command helped propel our do-it-yourself business to 10% organic growth in the third quarter. Sales in the consumer healthcare and homecare businesses also grew organically in Q3 while stationery and office supply was down slightly. Looking at the consumer business geographically, organic local currency growth was 5% in Asia Pacific and 4% in the United States. Back-to-school sales were strong in the U.S. mass retail channel. Consumers organic sales were down slightly in both EMEA and Latin America/Canada. Operating income was $272 million with operating margins of 23.2%. That wraps up my review of the quarter. Please turn to Slide 13 where I will address our forward outlook. Three quarters in, we are updating our guidance for the full year. We are expecting earnings to be in the range of $7.40 to $7.50 per share versus the prior expected range of $7.30 to $7.55 per share. With respect to organic local currency sales growth, we are narrowing the range to 4% to 5% versus the previous expected range of 3% to 6%. Given recent strength in the U.S. dollar, we are now estimating that foreign currency impacts will reduce sales by approximately 1.5%. Previously, we anticipated a 1% FX headwind. From an earnings perspective, FX for the full-year is now expected to be an approximate $0.15 per share headwind, $0.10 of which has occurred in the first three quarters of the year. We anticipate $0.05 of FX headwind in Q4. Our tax rate estimate is narrowed to 28.5% to 29%. And finally, as I mentioned previously, free cash flow conversion is expected to be between 95% and 100% for the year, up from a prior range of 90% to 100%. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Inge for some additional comments.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Nick. As I look across our enterprise, one eye is always on the microscope, driving results day to day, month to month, quarter to quarter. And I remain very pleased with those results. The other eye is on the telescope, ensuring we\u2019re investing for the long term prosperity. Three strategic levers are strengthening our foundation for the future. The first is portfolio management. I mentioned our Japanese acquisition along with portfolio actions in Electronics and Energy. Earlier this year, we also realigned divisions in our Safety and Graphics business group. And on Tuesday, we took action within our Industrial business group. Our personal care division was merged into industrial adhesives and tape division. This will increase customer relevance, create broader research and development and manufacturing capabilities, boost efficiency and position the business for greater success. The second lever is investing in innovation. Innovation is the heartbeat of 3M. It generates unique solutions for customers and raising value for shareholders. That is why research and development is in the center of our plan. We are increasing research and development investment to about 6% of sales by 2017. We\u2019re also funding 26 product platforms specifically aimed to create new sustainable growth to disruptive technologies. I\u2019m very encouraged that we are beginning to see initial product commercialization from some of those programs in healthcare, infrastructure, consumer and other markets. In September, we opened our 46th global customer technical center in the United Kingdom which showcases the breadth of our technology. Those facilities provide an ideal setting for our scientists to meet directly with customers and explore solutions to their unique challenges. This is a very important element as 3M is in the business of inventing things that are both new and useful. These investments are critical to bolstering our competitive edge into the future. The third lever is business transformation. This will allow us to deliver quicker and greater value to customers by creating a more ideal 3M. The backbone is a global ERP system. We are currently live in five countries. Most recently, we also successfully deployed our largest European distribution center in J\u00fcchen, Germany. With each deployment, we are learning more and using those lessons to refine our plans going forward. I remain encouraged by our progress and I will give you a further update on our December 16th investor meeting in New York. To support our ERP system, we are also in the process of creating a standardized global business process. Ultimately, this will leverage 3M\u2019s size and scale to drive productivity and improve service to customers. Those were the three strategic levers propelling our forward fuel. Yet, underpinning each strategy we adapt is the 3M team. Our company has many core strings. Chief among them is our people \u2013 their creativity, their skill and their ability to execute no matter the force of external headwinds. I thank our entire 3M team for delivering a strong third quarter even in a mixed global economic environment. Because of them, we are delivering consistent results today while remaining on track to meet our long term targets. Thank you for your attention. With that, we now welcome all your questions.\nOperator: (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital: Thanks, operator. Good morning, guys.\nInge Thulin: Good morning.\nScott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital: Inge, the numbers are great obviously and you did mention some macro concerns particularly in Europe. Is there any sense that you see particularly now that you at least have half the month of October through that your customers are starting to get concerned about macros and inventory to your [ph] stocking, any real slowdown or is this volatility that we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace maybe a little bit ahead of itself?\nInge Thulin: Yes. No, we see what you see and as you\u2019re calling out, you\u2019re talking about Europe a little bit, right?\nScott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital: Yes, yes.\nInge Thulin: So I think for us in the quarter, as you see on our result for West Europe, we slide down slightly versus Q1 and Q2. That was, I will say, a small temper in Germany relative to the industrial sector. But the consumer and retail piece in that market, meaning the domestic business were still doing okay if you talk about Germany as a country. And the interesting thing in Europe was that there are many countries there that have dragged the performance in West Europe as of the last couple of years like Iberia, Italy, Benelux, in some cases, Alpine. And they show slight growth. So even \u2013 and we saw growth in U.K. as well. So I will say that we saw a slight decline in the industrial piece but it\u2019s not alarming by definition for us. And when we look upon data, when we look upon IPI growth, GDP growth, PMI growth, et cetera, you can see a temper, specifically PMI, that is related to the manufacturing space but is not a concern at all. I will say also when we look upon West Europe in total with a slight decline in growth, if you pool all pieces together, we can in fact pace that down to some utility businesses that are project-based that we had a comparison that was a little bit tougher for us. And that business is coming back next year. So I will say that we got sideline in terms of West Europe if you combine it with total international.\nScott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital: Yes. And Inge, how about China? I mean, we see good and bad over there. Last time I was there, it seemed like half the businesses were fine, half not fine. But what \u2013 I mean, your business in China, I think about, if my notes are right, has been slowing a bit the last several quarters if I back into it. Are you seeing anything there that causes concern?\nInge Thulin: Well, we look upon the same metrics as I talked about for Germany, so IPI, GDP, PMI, et cetera. And when I look upon that for China, it look actually slightly better than the figures I talked about for Germany. So for us, we had a 4% growth in total. If you exclude electronic, it was 7%. So we are mid to high single-digit in our base business. And that is where we have been for the last I will say one to one and a half year. So for me, when I look upon China looking forward, even if they are building out, as we all know, they are building out a domestic business that is good for 3M with our consumer and healthcare business and even if there\u2019s a little bit pressure on the export business, I will say for us we see now us to be in mid to high single-digits. And it\u2019s very consistent for the last couple of quarters. So it\u2019s not \u2013 from that perspective looking forward, it\u2019s not an alarming figure for me.\nScott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital: Okay, very helpful. Well, I\u2019ll pass it on. Congrats, guys, and good luck.\nInge Thulin: Thank you very much.\nNick Gangestad: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nRam Sivalingam \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Hi, good morning. This is Ram Sivalingam sitting in for David.\nInge Thulin: Good morning.\nRam Sivalingam \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Good morning. Inge, a very, very strong margin quarter obviously, the best I think since 2010. As we go through Q4 and into \u201815 segment wise, where do you see upside or downside to margins?\nInge Thulin: We would talk more in December 16 relative to \u201815. And as you can see, we have improved this year very much in Electronics and Energy. That was based on the plan, right? So you recall that business and we go back now a couple of years, we have done a lot in that business in order to improve our performance, both in terms of growth and margins. As you have seen that we constantly have moved them upwards. And we have said for this year that they should come closer to 20, maybe not the whole way to 20 full year, but that is what they will be. And you also know that three of the businesses are basically on corporate average in terms of margin. And then you have Healthcare that is slightly higher I will say. So you will see us be able to continue the work we are doing on our portfolio and so forth. But I don\u2019t know that I can at this point in time call out someone. I think if you look upon it, it\u2019s very robust and broad based now which is good for us.\nRam Sivalingam \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Sure, that\u2019s very helpful. And maybe one quick follow-up. This move we see in the energy space, does it have any impact that you can see on your energy business or on your raw material side?\nNick Gangestad: You\u2019re specifically talking about oil prices?\nRam Sivalingam \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Exactly.\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Ram, we are \u2013 there\u2019s a portion of our raw materials, not a significant portion that are based on oil prices. Right now, we don\u2019t expect a significant impact from that. If we do look forward into the coming year, we\u2019ve had a couple of years where raw materials have been a tailwind to us and we do expect that to continue into 2015.\nRam Sivalingam \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Understood. Thank you very much.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes, good morning, guys.\nInge Thulin: Good morning.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning.\nAndrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just a question/observation. If we net out productivity in investment, it seems that we have turned positive for the first time since I think Inge you have become this company\u2019s CEO. And I\u2019m just wondering \u2013\nInge Thulin: Positive in terms of what?\nAndrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Well, if I net out the margin impact, right, for \u2013\nInge Thulin: Oh okay, yeah. I know that. Okay.\nAndrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: \u2013 discounts and productivity.\nInge Thulin: Yes, yes. Yes.\nAndrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Right. It sort of turned quite negative in 2012 and then it\u2019s been negative. And it\u2019s the first time it\u2019s now a contributor.\nInge Thulin: Yes.\nAndrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And I\u2019m just wondering, is that sustainable or do we revert back to being negative as you continue to invest for repositioning?\nNick Gangestad: Andrew, there\u2019s several things driving that productivity that you\u2019re noting. With the growth we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re seeing improved factory utilization. But also what we\u2019re seeing in our productivity improvements is the result of our prioritization and portfolio management that you are seeing a difference there. Our business model is to drive those productivity improvements and as we\u2019ve talked about with our strategic investments, to invest that to improve our capability going forward.\nAndrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Right. But do we think we\u2019re going to go back to sort of where it\u2019s a driver in margin or do you think it can actually turn positive \u2013 it\u2019s sustainable and positive or neutral.\nNick Gangestad: Andrew, I don\u2019t see us going back into negative productivity with the current economic situations we\u2019re facing. I see it continuing neutral to slightly positive. But some of that consumed by our continued strategic investments.\nAndrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Sure. The second question, just can you give us more color on Brazil because it\u2019s an area where we get a lot of questions from investors. It seems to be a concern. But you keep posting positive numbers. Can you just give more color on industrial versus consumer businesses and if you\u2019re seeing any sort of yellow flags? You keep telling us you guys are going to do okay and believing you keep doing okay. But any color will help.\nInge Thulin: Well, we were positive in Brazil this quarter. And as you probably recall, last quarter was more of a concern. So we actually turned more positive in this quarter. We had a 4% organic local currency growth. And by the way, we had 15% organic local currency growth in Mexico. So I always say when you look upon it, we have a big industrial business down there. And they grew at every at the average of the company. So I\u2019d say Brazil was types of average in terms of the growth type of mid-single digit for this quarter. And my own prediction is it will be slightly better as we move ahead. Now when you talk about some others and their performance and so forth, I cannot comment with that. But I can tell, we have been in Brazil since 1946 as we probably have talked about before. So we have a very solid organization there where we have all function in place. We have a strong manufacturing footprint in order to deliver in that local market. We have a very capable research and development organization and we have a commercialization arm that we, as you know, always going in with first. So I think one of the success factors for us is we have all functions in place in Brazil and been there for a long time. We know the market, know the culture, we\u2019re able to develop solutions for their market and produce it there in their home country. So I think that\u2019s maybe one differentiator for us versus some other people. But we saw slight uptick in this quarter versus last quarter. And I\u2019m very happy with that business there. And I\u2019m more optimistic moving forward than opposite.\nAndrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Fantastic. Thank you very much.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research: Hi, thanks, and good morning.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Steve.\nSteven Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research: I guess an impressive margin performance. That 1.4 would be even higher I guess if we exclude that healthcare gain as well. But I\u2019m trying to just maybe understand what\u2019s implied in the margin side just \u2013 I know you don\u2019t want to talk about 2015, but at least fourth quarter, in terms of what you\u2019re expecting for those dynamics on that breakout chart that you gave us on Page 5. I mean how should we be thinking about how those any major changes in any of those pieces might look over the next quarter anyway?\nInge Thulin: As I look out in the next quarter, we expect deals and continued benefit on price of raw materials. Pension of course will continue as a benefit. And productivity probably still continuing as a benefit. FX right now which was fairly neutral on the third quarter, I think it\u2019s more likely to think of that as a negative on the fourth quarter.\nSteven Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research: Okay. All right. And the other question is I guess over a long period of time, various management in 3M have talked about the sustainability of healthcare margins. And we\u2019ve often heard about whether that\u2019s in the kind of mid 20s, high 20s, low 30s. Inge, maybe just provide a little bit of your perspective there. I mean should we really be thinking at this point that there\u2019s no reason to believe that you can\u2019t sustain R&D investment sales investment and still deliver those kinds of margins? Or is there a pricing pressure in some of the various developed countries that is going to make that more challenging?\nInge Thulin: Well, high 20s or low 30s, they are very good. And we have a very effective model and we are very confident that the solutions that we are providing both in the developed world and the developing world will let us continue to be competitive not only the marketplace in terms of market share, but also due to our capabilities in manufacturing which is a very strong side for us to have manufacturing capabilities that is holding our cost on very low and competitive positions. So if you think about the healthcare space, generally, for many, many decades there have always been pressure in those markets. So I can recall myself when I lead back in Europe early \u201890s and so forth, there was this German Healthcare Reform Act. It was exactly what is going on from time to time in countries. So we are used to be able to scale and leverage our businesses as we go ahead. So I\u2019m not overly concerned about us being able to maintain margins at the very high level. Now we are continuing to invest and you have seen and when you look upon our mix, 75% of our business in healthcare is in developed economy. And only 25% in developing. And the growth will come there overtime and we\u2019re able to renew product and technical solutions able to put new price points based on the evidence of improved customer satisfaction in that segment. So it\u2019s a good space for us. We continue to invest and we are very, very local in all those markets. And domestic market, local market is good for us. We know how to do that.\nSteven Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research: Okay. Fantastic. Just one point of clarification also. Based on your Venezuela comment, so just to be explicit, Latin America, Canada would have been 6.4% ex-Venezuela. Did I understand that correctly?\nNick Gangestad: You understand that correctly.\nSteven Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nInge Thulin: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Hi, good morning everyone.\nInge Thulin: Good morning.\nJoseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs: So my first question is on free cash flow and the balance sheet. And Nick, can you provide a little bit more detail on the strong free cash flow conversion this quarter? I mean was there anything one time like an inventory flush that helped it? And then on the balance sheet, specifically you guys called out an increase of $1 billion in buyback, is the next buyback also increasing by a billion?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, a couple of questions there. First of all, on the free cash flow, no, there is not one particular thing that swung that up. It\u2019s a combination of several things. Good inventory management, continuation of low needs through, be funding a strong pension, good CapEx spending in line with our expectations. It\u2019s really the combination of several things that are resulting in that 103% free cash flow conversion we saw this quarter. To your second question, the $1 billion raised on top and bottom of the range on growth share repurchases, that $1 billion would also apply to the net share repurchases range too.\nJoseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe staying on the balance sheet for a second. Inge, perhaps you can provide a little color on the M&A environment. Clearly, you\u2019ve got the Sumitomo deal done but maybe talk a little bit about the pipeline, what you\u2019re seeing out there today.\nInge Thulin: Yes, the pipeline is good for us as we look upon it. We have done a couple of acquisitions during the last 12 months as we talked about. Sumitomo was one that maybe you guys was not thinking so much about before we did it. But it was a very good one if you look upon the financials there. And with Treo which was a smaller one. And as Nick said, we are executing that very, very well actually and ahead of both top and bottom line relative to expectation. So every business group has a good, robust pipeline and we are looking upon them. I think the important thing for us when we look upon them, we need to make sure that first of all, they fit into our portfolio now that is categorized in terms of where we would like to go. And then also the four fundamental strings of 3M which is around technology, manufacturing capabilities, brand and the global capabilities. So we need to make sure that those four fundamentals are directly linked in so we can drive additional value as fast as possible when we do them. So I would say our pipeline is okay. The multiples are maybe too high based on how we think about it today. And as you know, the primary strategy for us is organic local currency growth. And that is why we are beating up the investment and research and development. And when I look upon what we are delivering from an organic local currency perspective, and done now for quite some time in the range of, as you know, we have about 4% to 6%. So I\u2019m happy with that. I think that\u2019s one of the things we have to remain focused on that acquisitions will be complementary and they should be strategically important and we should be able to drive value immediately for us and for you.\nJoseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Okay. Great. Thanks. Maybe if I could sneak one more in on the electronic and energy margins that the margins. The last three quarter have been incredibly good. So maybe talk about the sustainability of what you\u2019re seeing in that specific business.\nInge Thulin: So first of all, we have to go back and think about what we did in that business. We started by realigning those businesses and reduced a number of touch points out to the customers. And we did that at least two years now it seems. We tapped or realigned that organization and formed an organization that did a couple of things. First of all, we\u2019re able to touch the end market. We\u2019re able to connect back to our technology platforms and respond much faster with solutions to a very fast moving market. So I think that was a key element. And we also made sure that we could get better asset utilization as we aligned the businesses. And as you know that will also then drive productivity into our organization structure, et cetera. The business have gone, since it was formed over two years ago, I think from 15, 17 and now at 15, 17 I think we start 17 this year. We are touching closer to 20 as we have said for the year. That business by definition is a little bit more volatile than the other businesses for us. But our expectation here at 3M and on that business is that they should be part of almost close to the average of the company as we move ahead. So I think we\u2019re on a much better place today based on the streamlines work we have done around the organization structure which all have been in the benefit for the customer in terms of responsiveness and for us, relative to asset utilization.\nJoseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Okay. Great. Thank you for taking my questions.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal at FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nAjay Kejriwal \u2013 FBR Capital Markets: Thank you. Good morning.\nInge Thulin: Good morning Ajay.\nAjay Kejriwal \u2013 FBR Capital Markets: So were really strong here. You\u2019ve actually seen acceleration. It looks like you had 2.6% in first quarter, 4.5%, second, and now 6%. And I guess it\u2019s not easy on accounts because you had a really good quarter last year as well. So Inge, maybe share your thoughts on what\u2019s driving this. What are you seeing broadly? How much of this growth here is end market versus some of the work you\u2019re doing? And might this be some restarting that could be contributing?\nInge Thulin: Yes. No, I don\u2019t \u2013 first of all, let\u2019s \u2013 the business, if you look upon our businesses, we had good growth in all of them, different business group in United States led by industrial. So industrial had 8% growth in United States. But you had also Healthcare of 6%. And you have Safety and Graphics of 7%. So very strong robust growth. And in our view, it\u2019s not a build of inventory in the channels as we can see it. The economy has improved and we are able to capitalize on that. Now if you think about what we have done at 3M and I don\u2019t know if you recall that, but let me take you back two and a half years, so \u2013 yes, more than two and a half years, when we start to refocus our U.S. organization we had at that point in time, very much an organization that in many function were global and there\u2019s this total accountability and responsibility relative to execution on the United States subsidiary if you remind that discussion. And that work started actually in May of 2011 and have continued since in terms of making sure that there is a specific execution arms for every division in United States as well as we have had in Germany and Japan and Chile and Russia, et cetera. So I think there\u2019s two elements into it as I reflect on it. One is that we are capitalized on the economical situation in the United States. And number two, I believe that we also have moved our organization to a much more focused execution \u2013 we\u2019re a much more focused execution model in United States. So it\u2019s both and it\u2019s broad-based as I said. We have business still growing 6%, 7%, 8% in United States in the quarter. That\u2019s very, very good. And we have seen a tick up here shortly as you said from Q1 to Q2 to Q3, we see an uptick and a growth in United States.\nAjay Kejriwal \u2013 FBR Capital Markets: Excellent. That\u2019s very helpful. And then Nick, maybe on the tax rates. So it\u2019s gone up a little bit here. I guess a part of it is mixed. But how should be think about the trajectory as you implement some of the planning initiatives say into next year?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. Every quarter as you can imagine, there is puts and takes that cause the rate to fluctuate some up and down. We had some benefits of third quarter last year, not repeating. We also had some onetime expense this quarter actually related to your more long-term question, a onetime charge related to the establishment of our distribution center that we set up in the EMEA region. And so as you think about this long-term, we\u2019ve guided to expecting a 27% tax rate by 2017 and we see ourselves on track to that.\nInge Thulin: Thanks, Ajay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners: Good morning, good morning. Just a couple of things. I know you don\u2019t want to get into a big discussion about next year, but with all the global gyrations, I thought maybe some of the non-operational things, you could at least give us a little insight on, right, the state of the globe. Maybe it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess. But pension has kind of come back to the floor. It\u2019s possibly an issue for companies and we\u2019ve got this mortality table dynamic out there. So I\u2019m wondering if you could give us a little bit of color there if there\u2019s anything to think about. And then just FX too, I mean we can all kind of try to work through our own guesstimate. But is there anything to be aware for 3M on how you\u2019re hedging or translation versus transaction to just kind of be mindful of as we try to think about what next year looks like?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Jeff, a couple of things. Of course you know we\u2019ll share full details in December on many things. But for a couple that you\u2019re asking about, I think they\u2019re both worthy of mention right now. First of all, on the second part of your question on FX, with the movement we\u2019ve seen in the U.S. dollar in recent weeks, our estimate if we were to take FX rate as they exist right now is that year-on-year in 2015, we expect about $0.10 headwind on earnings per share. That\u2019s a net after hedging impact. And in comparison, that\u2019s to a $0.15 headwind that we\u2019re expecting in 2014. On your first part of your question on the pension, multiple factors going into that \u2013 the asset returns we\u2019re experiencing this year, the discount rate expectation and the mortality table. If I take all three of those in combination, we\u2019re looking \u2013 we\u2019re estimating at least $100 million headwind going into 2015 on earnings per share on our earnings next year. I think that covers what you were asking, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners: Yes, it does. And maybe just one more and I\u2019ll move on. I think your tax rate has crept up this year in your guide because you were anticipating the extenders and everything. And it looks like that\u2019s not happening. But should we expect any tax rate headwinds? And I kind of ask the question in the spirit of this U.S. strength? Is there any kind of move in the mix of your earnings that are actually tax rate negative that we should be thinking about or anything else that\u2019s idiosyncratic to 3M that may affect the tax rate?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Jeff. The tax rate is impacted by our mix of profits we earn around the world. Our current guidance of 28.5% to 29% takes into account that current mix we\u2019re expecting for 2014. And on the extenders, we currently are still building that into our estimate for 2014. And if it doesn\u2019t pass, that would likely put us at the high end of the range that I\u2019ve talked about.\nJeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Tusa \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities: Hey, good morning.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Steve.\nStephen Tusa \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities: Clearly, some very good execution against the tougher Forex and global environment out there. The margin was definitely stronger than we were expecting I guess. In the context of what I see here as kind of a 75% incremental margin year-over-year and the thing that kind of stands out the most obviously is this productivity line. Utilization, I kind of understand, what do you mean by portfolio management exactly? What is that?\nNick Gangestad: Portfolio management, Steve, is some of the actions we\u2019ve been taking as part of our strategic investments to in some cases combined businesses for efficiency and better relevance to our customers as well as some restructuring expenses that we\u2019ve taken. That when we say portfolio management in that regard, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.\nStephen Tusa \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities: So it\u2019s not like a year-over-year. This is like blocking and tackling on cost takeout from business combinations?\nNick Gangestad: Exactly.\nStephen Tusa \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities: Okay. And then just in the fourth quarter here. I guess it seems a pretty steady state organic growth you\u2019re guiding to, any kind of movement around the various pieces of the business geographically in the fourth quarter?\nInge Thulin: No, not where we can see at this point in time. See, we have guidance there, we are 4% to 5% for the year and we feel confident around that.\nStephen Tusa \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.\nInge Thulin: Yes. Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Oh, good morning. Thanks for the \u2013\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Nigel.\nNigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Good morning. Nick, you mentioned $100 million for the pension at the current discount rate [ph], does that then feed [ph] mortality tables because I get $100 million just with discount rates. But you mentioned mortality table as well.\nNick Gangestad: Yes. Nigel, that\u2019s taking three things into account \u2013 us adopting the new mortality table, a roughly 50 basis point drop in our discount rate and the asset returns that we have experienced and are expecting to experience for 2014.\nNigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Okay. And that\u2019s very helpful. And then obviously the margin strength has been discussed [indiscernible] so far. If I had to speak into the next layer, looking at the SG&A as portions of sales down I think about 70 basis points year-over-year and R&D flat. And I\u2019m wondering, given that global IPI has come in a little bit weaker than we all expected, is there any element of just putting back a little bit on growth investments, a bit more action on cost control at this point just given the movements we see in SG&A and R&D?\nNick Gangestad: Nigel, what we\u2019re seeing on the movement there is function of our normal drive on productivity. It\u2019s not really a change in our trajectory on our growth investments that we\u2019re making. Those are continuing. We are on year-on-year seeing a pension benefit that\u2019s impacting SG&A. And then to the later point I made, the portfolio management where we\u2019ve been taking some restructuring actions, we\u2019re starting to see some of the benefits that those manifest in our SG&A expenses.\nNigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Okay. That\u2019s great. And just finally, microchip born, if you like, on electronics end markets earlier this month, are you seeing any weakening at all in all the markets for 3M?\nInge Thulin: No, we did not see that at all. So our electronics business did very well as you saw with, I think we called it out with 8% organic local currency growth. So we didn\u2019t see anything on that. I think the external data at least going back to Q2 was indicating then at that market went sideway overall, right, so now then it\u2019s for you if you\u2019re in that segment then depending what you are in that segment, then it\u2019s coming down to execution. Make sure that you capitalize on the market overall. Based on our portfolio, we didn\u2019t see that.\nNigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thank you very much guys.\nInge Thulin: Okay.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call.

Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide two. During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Now please turn to slide three, and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Inge Thulin, 3M\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Matt. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. 3M performed strong in the second quarter, once again posting organic growth across all business groups and all geographic areas. Our team delivered record sales and rising margins and did so while continuing to build for the future. Let me take you through a few highlights for the quarter. Earnings were $1.91 per share, up 11.7% year-over-year. Sales rose to $8.1 billion, which marks the highest quarterly sales in 3M history. Organic local currency sales growth was 4.8%, lead by electronics and energy at 6%. Health care, industrial, and safety and graphics, each grew 5%, and consumer grew 4%. Geographic growth was paced by Asia-Pacific at 7%. Europe Middle East Africa and United States both grew 5% followed by Latin America Canada at 3%. Premium margins remain a hallmark for 3M. In the second quarter margins rose to nearly 23%, up 80 basis points from last year. I am pleased that all five business groups delivered margins greater than 20% demonstrating the breadth of our strength. As you know, we are managing toward a better optimized capital structure. This will enable us to invest more in the business and return more cash to shareholders. During the second quarter, we returned 2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And as you see on slide four, last week we announced our plan to acquire the remaining 25% of our Sumitomo subsidiary at the price of $885 million. This business is a leader in many of our industrial divisions plus electronics and energy. In addition, we see significant opportunities in Japan\u2019s addressable markets for healthcare, safety and graphics and consumer businesses. Upon closing of the deal, 3M will have full control of one of our largest and more successful subsidiaries. We look forward to growing this business even further in the future. Now please turn to slide five. Today, we\u2019re reaffirming our earnings and organic growth outlook for the full year. We continue to expect earnings per share of $7.30 to $7.55 and organic sales growth of plus 3 to plus 6%. Currency impact should reduce full year sales by approximately 1%, and we still estimate the tax rate of 28% to 29% with free cash flow conversion at 90% to 100%.  I'd like to mention a few other notable things from the second quarter. In April, 3M earned United States Environment Protection Agency\u2019s Energy Star Award for the 10th consecutive year. No other industrial company has been so recognized by the EPA. Research and development is the heartbeat of our company. And in May, we were pleased to receive our 100,000 patent. And last month, we appointed Nick Gangestad, as our Chief Financial Officer. I would like to take this opportunity to thank David Meline for his contribution over six years including three years as CFO which followed three years as Chief Accounting Officer. Nick now became CFO also after serving three years as Chief Accounting Officer. Previously, Nick held key leadership positions in multiple business groups around the world and he's well prepared for this his new role. He is a 27-year veteran of 3M and I've personally known and worked with Nick for the last 10 of those years. He has worked directly with me on executing our financial and operational strategies and I am happy to have him as our CFO.  And by that, I\u2019ll give the call over to Nick. Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Thank you, Inge, and good morning everyone. Let me just say that I am excited to lead 3M\u2019s finance team and to help the 3M leadership team create even greater value going forward. And to those of you on the line that I have yet to meet, I certainly look forward to meeting you in the future. Now, please turn to Slide 6 and I\u2019ll take you through our income statement. The Company operated well in the second quarter with sales exceeding $8 billion for the first time in our history, compared to last year sales were up 5%, operating income up 9%, and earnings per share up 12%. Productivity was particularly strong this quarter, which helped fueled more investment in SG&A and R&D as we continue building for the future. And at the same time, we expanded operating margins by nearly 1 point. I'll go into a little more detail on the margin change. Leverage on organic volume added 30 basis points to second quarter operating margins and the combination of lower raw material cost and higher selling prices contributed 1.2% each points year-on-year. Selling prices continue to be supported by technology innovation, which is a key fundamental strength of the Company and helps drive unique customer solutions and an increasing flow of new products. We also began raising prices in mid-2013 to help offset currency weakness in select developing countries. This will result in our price performance moderating in the second half of the year beginning in Q3.  And on the raw material front, we are benefiting from lower market prices and from our sourcing teams' efforts to reduce cost even further. Reduced pension and OPEB expense added 50 basis points to second quarter margins. Strategic investments this quarter reduced margins year-on-year by 40 basis points. This included increases in new disruptive R&D programs, business transformation and ERP cost, and restructuring. Foreign exchange impacts excluding the positive price recovery I just mentioned reduced margins by 60 basis points. All in all second quarter earnings increased 12% to a $1.91 per share. Foreign currency impacts reduced earnings by $0.04 per share and the higher tax rate reduced earnings by another $0.05 per share. Average diluted shares outstanding declined by 5% versus last year's second quarter, which added $0.09 to second quarter earnings per share. All things considered, this was a good quarter for the Company. Slide 7 outlines the details of our second quarter sales change. Worldwide organic local currency growth was 4.8% with volumes up 3.5% and selling prices up 1.3%. Our businesses have done a good job of executing under growth plans. Acquisitions added 10 basis points to sales growth and foreign exchange had no impact on the second quarter worldwide sales. On a total U.S. dollar basis sales rose 4.9% versus the second quarter of 2013. As was the case in the first quarter, Organic sales growth was positive across all major geographic areas. Asia-Pacific organic growth was 6.6%. Organic growth was again broad-based with all five business groups growing led by our electronics and energy and consumer businesses. Organic growth was 7% in Japan or 2% ex-electronics. China, Hong Kong, grew 6% organically in Q2 with or 10% excluding electronics, which was an improvement versus the first quarter\u2019s underlying growth rate. Organic growth in EMEA was 4.8% in the second quarter. West Europe grew 3.5%, Central/East Europe grew high single-digits and Middle East/Africa grew at a double digit pace. EMEA\u2019s growth was strongest in safety and graphics, electronics and energy and industrial. Our teams in EMEA are executing well in 2014.  In the United States second quarter organic local currency growth was 4.5%, up from Q1 and led by healthcare and safety and graphics.  Finally, Latin America/Canada grew 2.7% organically with electronics and energy and healthcare leading the way. Mexico generated double-digit organic growth and Brazil was down slightly. Organic local currency growth was 7% across all developing markets and 4% in developed markets.  Now let\u2019s turn to cash flow, turn to slide number 8. Looking at first half 2014 results, free cash flow was 2.1 billion or 143 million above 2013 levels. Operating cash flow was up 59 million and capital expenditures were 84 million lower versus the prior year. We expect the full year CapEx to be approximately 1.5 billion to 1.6 billion in 2014, down slightly versus a previous expectation of 1.7 billion to 1.8 billion. We are encouraged to see that our portfolio management efforts are providing greater clarity regarding business unit priorities and their related CapEx needs. Improved plant productivity is also freeing up capacity as we continue to improve our plant efficiency and add lean capability over time. Through the first six months of 2014, we converted 85% of net income to free cash flow versus 84% in the first half of 2013. We continue to expect full year conversion to be in the range of 90% to 100%. At our 2013 December Investor Meeting, we articulated plans to manage toward a better optimized capital structure going forward and to allocate capital accordingly. The plan calls for additional balance sheet leverage which we'll use for two purposes. First, to invest in order to expand and improve our businesses and second, to increase cash returns to shareholders. We are executing this plan in 2014, evidenced in-part by last week\u2019s announcement that we will acquire the remaining 25% non-controlling interest in Sumitomo 3M which Inge covered earlier. We will finance this deal with non-U.S. cash and we expect it to close in the third quarter. We also paid 1.1 billion in cash dividends in the first six months of 2014, up 246 million year-on-year. Gross share repurchases were 3.1 billion during that same period. For full year 2014, we expect gross share repurchases will be in the range of 4.5 billion to 5 billion versus a previous expectation of 4 billion to 5 billion. Net debt at the end of June was 2.8 billion, up 1.5 billion versus year-end 2013. During the second quarter, 3M issued 625 million of five year debt at a cue point of (1 and 5/8%) [ph] and 325 million of 30 year debt at a cue point of (3 and 7/8%) [ph]. Next I will go through the results for each of our business groups, starting with industrial, please go to slide number 9. Our industrial business continues to perform nicely with second quarter sales of 2.8 billion and 5% organic local currency growth. Our 3M purification business again grew at a double-digit pace in the second quarter and we also posted nice growth in automotive OEM, aerospace and commercial, transportation, abrasives systems, and industrial adhesives and tapes. On a geographic basis, industrials organic growth was 7% in Asia Pacific and 5% in both the U.S. and EMEA. Latin America/Canada was down slightly in the quarter. Second quarter operating income was 670 million. Operating margins were 21.9%. Recall that each our business groups is absorbing incremental investment in 2014 related to business transformation and ERP implementation. This had the effect of reducing Q2 margins for each of our five businesses by 30 basis points.  Let\u2019s now look at Safety and Graphics, found on slide 10. You will see that Safety and Graphics sales were 1.5 billion in the quarter with organic growth of 5%. Personal safety is a heartland division in 3M and one of our largest in terms of sales. It was once again the fastest growing business within Safety and Graphics posting high single digit organic growth in Q2. We also saw positive growth in Commercial Solutions and in Traffics, Safety and Security systems. Sales in our roofing granules business declined versus last year\u2019s second quarter. Safety and Graphics grew organically in all major geographic areas led by EMEA at 7% and U.S. at 5%. Operating income was 353 million in the second quarter and operating margins were a solid 23.6%. Please go to Slide 11. Electronics and Energy also turned in a good second quarter performance. Sales were 1.4 billion, up 6% in organic local currency terms. Our electronics related businesses posted organic local currency growth of 11%. Growth was strong in both display materials and systems and in electronics materials and solutions. In our energy related businesses, sales increased 1% organically. Second quarter organic local currency growth was 9% in Latin America, Canada; 8% in Asia-Pacific; and 6% in EMEA. The U.S. was flat year-on-year. Operating income rose 23% to 293 million and operating margins were 20.6%. Next, I will take you through Healthcare found on Slide 12. Building on a strong first quarter performance, our healthcare business once again delivered strong growth and profitability. Second quarter sales were just over 1.4 billion. Organic local currency sales growth was 5% and margins were strong at 30.7%. All businesses contributed to healthcare\u2019s growth in the second quarter. Health information systems, critical and chronic care, and infection prevention led the way. In April, we also further strengthened our health information systems business by acquiring Treo Solutions, a leader in using data analytics, to redesign payments structures and help transition healthcare providers to value based care models. Integration efforts are running ahead of expectations. Healthcare\u2019s organic sales grew in all geographic areas paced by Latin America, Canada, and Asia-Pacific at 7%, the U.S. at 6% and EMEA at 3%. Operating income was 434 million and again operating margins were 30.7% adjusting for Treo operating margins were 31.1%. I\u2019ll wrap up with the consumer business group found on Slide number 13. Sales in the consumer business group were 1.1 billion with organic local currency growth of 4%. Our construction in home improvement business delivered strong double organic growth in the second quarter and we also posted positive growth in our consumer, healthcare and home care businesses. Stationary and office supply sales were basically flat year-on-year. Second quarter organic growth across consumer was 4% in the U.S. which was up from Q1. Back to school activity began in late Q2 so we\u2019re off to a good start there. Elsewhere, consumers\u2019 organic growth was 8% in Asia-Pacific and 4% in EMEA. In Latin America/Canada, sales were down slightly in organic local currency terms. Operating income was 241 million with operating margins of 21.1%. That wraps up my review and I will turn it back to Inge.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Nick. As you can see, there is a lot to like this quarter across the entire company. In industrial for example automotive volumes grew four times the rate of global (automobiles) [ph]. And in 3M purification formally known as CUNO, organic growth was 13% and we see this business accelerating in many areas of the world. I am encouraged by the growth in consumer of the modest first quarter which includes a nice improvement in the United States. Our home improvement division together with consumer healthcare and homecare all showed good growth. Our safety and graphic business performed well. Personal safety for example grew 9% globally including more than 25% in China. In healthcare, we continue to expand worldwide with 12% growth in developing markets this quarter. I am pleased that all healthcare businesses grew on a global basis. Finally in electronics and energy, our portfolio management actions continue to payoff. Over the past couple of years, we have consolidated several divisions to better align with customers and improved our competitiveness. Those actions along with strong volumes drove margins higher in the second quarter. Through six months, margins were 19% and we expect the full year to trend towards 20%. So overall I want to thank our entire 3M team for delivering another strong broad based performance. And going forward we will continue to gain even more value through our three strategic levels; portfolio management, investing in innovation and business transformation. Those levels are helping us deliver solid results today while also building a stronger foundation for long term success. Thank you for your attention. And with that we now welcome your questions. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis, Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Davis - Barclays Bank: Not much to pick on in the quarter it was solid overall. But one thing that wasn\u2019t clear in the slides at least on Slide 9 industrial was -- margins were down 60 bps -- 30 bps of it but I would have thought with organic growth of about 5% you would have some operating leverage on that. So maybe just some clarification on why those margins were down.\nInge Thulin: Hi Scott, this is Inge. When you think about our business group in industrial that\u2019s the biggest business group for us and also the business group that we are historically and still today entering first when we go into new markets based on the size and scale and so forth and that\u2019s the way we have talked about how we build out businesses from infrastructure, industrial, safety, consumer and healthcare, as the economies evolve. So if you think about that business on a global scale the way we operate it, that\u2019s like 32% of total company. When you go to developing economies, it\u2019s slightly more, it\u2019s 35%-36% and then you go to emerging market which is closer I would say to 45%. So when we looked upon it and yes as you said -- so why was this happening. The real reason there is actually they have a bigger slowdown in the emerging market in the developing world. So I am not concerned at all about it, in fact when I looked upon industrial in terms of the growth which is the important element, we saw 5% growth in United States, we saw 5% in Europe Middle East Africa and we saw 11% in China. So when I looked upon it overall I am pleased with industrial but the reason is the 30 basis point as you call out and then as that portfolio in that type of emerging market as we all know at the moment there is some small turbulence I would say if you think about Central East Europe we have a little bit of the impact in Latin America, et cetera, that\u2019s the reason. But I am not concerned and I don\u2019t think you should be concerned either. We have a very good team there that are running those businesses very well. And so automotive very good, purification again a fantastic quarter, so all core businesses are doing well there.\nScott Davis - Barclays Bank: Okay, that helps a lot. And Inge just because you referenced macro, I mean, I think we\u2019ve had 15 companies report so far this quarter. And I can\u2019t tell whether the world to getting better or the world to getting worse. What is your view on global macro, maybe by region?\nInge Thulin: Yes, well, first of all, there is the macro picture and then how we expect to perform in that world, if you think. So, first of all, I will say, in West Europe, if you think about us, we guided a year from flat to 3% and we came out first quarter with three, actually this quarter more or less the same and we still think that that will be the range for us for the year. So, that\u2019s a little bit on the positive side for us in terms of our execution. In Asia, we saw a slight improvement in China, or what I would call base business and for me, then base business, yes, so we talk the same languages if I take out electronics because that is moving around in Asia in between countries. Our base business in China consecutive went from 8% to 10%, and has a big improvement versus a year ago. And our Japanese business in fact in total grew 7%. And if you, again, look upon the base, that was 2%. So I will say Asia is going sideways slightly up; West Europe as we expected, United States, small strength; and we had a better second quarter than first. And as you recall I said at that time, I am not concerned about U.S., because I had a feeling it will come back in the second and that was correct. I think the place where we see a little bit of modest challenge is Latin America where we said before for the year 8 to 11 and we think now may be mid digit for the year. So, slightly down but it\u2019s offset for us by other regions of the world. So, I think that\u2019s what we are saying still 3 to 6, so I will say that I don\u2019t see much of a movement versus what we have talked about earlier. Latin America slightly slower, West Europe slightly better, U.S. slightly better and also big geographical areas, so that will compensate more what you can see as I will identify as a temporarily slowdown in Latin America.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Thank you. Good morning. Inge, very strong results in electronics and energy, can you give us a little more color on the margin expansion you've had in the first half and I guess a little bit more margin expansion in the back half to get to the [indiscernible] you are guiding to?\nInge Thulin : Yes, first of all as you recall we looked upon our portfolio, it\u2019s almost two years ago now and we consolidated many businesses that was related to electronic and energy in the company that in some cases we had in different components of the company. So, we streamlined organization and consolidate in order for us to be faster to market and be able to respond to the customer need. So, we did that and we combined the division and the outcome of that is that we got a lower infrastructure to work with. We have got better utilization of assets and we are faster to respond to markets and we have moved, I will say from in some cases product sales to more system sales which is now paying off. So, I think we had 11% growth in electronics and a lot of that is coming to the new approach with this display material system division that is now selling components into solution for the electronic market.  So, I would say it\u2019s a combination of efficiency into organization, better utilization in manufacturing and then we had the volume upticks that came direct on based on the work we're doing with the customer. So, if you think about where we have taken that business for the last 18 months or so from 15 to 17 and actually this quarter we did over 20. But the plan is to go towards 20 and that\u2019s where we are for the year. I think the plan is 19 plus and I think that\u2019s where it will end up for the remainder of the year and certainly will be a good year for that group. And they have really responded well to our portfolio management initiatives.\nDavid Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Very good and impressive. And one more thing, Inge just in safety this double-digit growth you've seen in personal protection, how sustainable is that growth in the back half of the year?\nInge Thulin: Well, we have a very strong position in that business historically. It\u2019s a fantastic platform for us and is very global in scope and we are, I will say the leader in that whole space relative to respiratory protection. It\u2019s sustainable and I think the trends are positive for us and if you think about some parts of the world where it's very strong regulations like United States and West Europe and so forth and we're doing well there. And then you have I will say developing economies and I will put China into developing economies. So, if you think about China in terms of mega trends in China that\u2019s -- its air pollution, its water and its food safety. When air pollution is playing very well to our very strong position in this business, so when you see 9% growth for quarter, 25 plus in China, this is sustainable as a business on a global space. And one of the reasoning, we have scale and we have a very professional team in place and it\u2019s a regulatory business, so it\u2019s good for us, generally speaking -- regulated business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: Inge, just a quick question or Nick, on the Sumitomo impact, you said it\u2019s closing September 1st, you've got a 12 month, $0.08 impact, you are not changing guidance. So that first four months which I guess I would have assumed would be more cost and benefit, you're just making up for that elsewhere. How should be think about the dilutive or accretive impact before the end of this year?\nNick Gangestad : Yes, Steve, this is Nick. You are correct, we said that\u2019s approximately an $0.08 benefit over the 12 months and we are expecting this to close on September 1. At this point, we felt it was premature to up our -- change our guidance at this point we\u2019re halfway through the year, everything's going right down the middle of what we\u2019re expecting. And just as this is a slight upside to our original expectation we have other things that are on a slight negative, for example, FX impact. We started the year thinking that would be flat to hurting us by $0.05 we\u2019re now in the $0.07-$0.08 range of impact. So, all in all, we think everything is staying very close to our original guidance.\nMatt Ginter: Steve, maybe one, Steve, this is Matt maybe one follow up. The transaction should not have a lot of cost associated with it from an integration standpoint. But third quarter we expect really de minims impact on earnings and assuming we close on September 1st as expected we\u2019d expect some slight accretion and you could think about it on a straight line basis using that $0.08 as a guide.\nSteven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: Fantastic, that\u2019s very helpful. The other point is on CapEx, that roughly $200 million lower guide in last quarter and you called out some of the lean and other impacts that you\u2019re having. But this is a strike me as a really potentially massive shift in terms of what you\u2019re getting out of this. Can you maybe talk also, are there any things that you\u2019re deferring what you aren\u2019t doing even year-on-year it\u2019s lower now. And should we kind of rethink our business model on CapEx side for 3M going forward based on what you\u2019re getting as indicated here or am I making too big a deal out of it?\nNick Gangestad:\n : Steve I appreciate the question. Our business model, over a longer period of time as we invest between 4.5% and 5% of revenue in CapEx, and we started the year with an estimate on the high end of that range. As we\u2019ve gone through the year and we\u2019re seeing those benefits which I talked about earlier, we\u2019re seeing an opportunity that we don\u2019t need some of the capital that we started out the year anticipating we may need. There is really I would say Steve, to your question should we change the modeling going forward, no. We\u2019re basically in that 4.5% to 5% range and we expect to stay there. As temporary what we\u2019re seeing of the benefits this year and really reflects great results that the team is doing so far this year.\nInge Thulin: We don\u2019t hold back on any investment relative to our growth, so there we continue them as we have laid out. But again for me this is a positive sign relative to the operation here in terms of in some cases better utilization around the world. And if you think about our strategies, the fourth strategy that as we laid out where we talk about intensified capabilities to achieve regional sales sufficiency, I think we\u2019ve been able to start to move in that direction. But it\u2019s too early to change the model by definition but I think as this year, this is what it look for us and then we think is the right time now, we have to correct that for the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just want to follow up on Steve\u2019s question, just thinking about energy and electronics, I know this was a big focus for the team in terms of improving efficiency of this business. You guys have eluded sourcing initiatives, you have eluded planned productivity initiatives. Do you care to quantify the impact of those and when, if not now, when do you think we will hear about sort of more discrete items there?\nDavid Meline: Andrew, in terms of productivity, we have, in the past, we\u2019ve shared in our margin walk how we see productivity impacting, or positively or negatively, our results. If you think back to a year ago, we were showing with utilization a negative impact on our financial results. This quarter we\u2019re not showing that, year on year we\u2019re seeing a benefit by that lack of headwind. And in measuring productivity in our plants something that was slightly negative in 2013 has turned slightly positive for us in the first half of this year.\nAndrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. But it just seems a sort of a broader initiative than just quarter over quarter change. But I guess we can take that offline. The other question though on the CapEx question, you did have CapEx yet you left your cash realization target intact. So, is there extra cash consumption on the working capital side or you're just being conservative right now?\nInge Thulin: I think we just would like to keep the flexibility as we go here. So the way I think about it and we think about, we\u2019re like six months into the year and we would like to keep the flexibility as we go. There is just two more quarters and we were able hopefully to talk more about it on the next quarter as we move ahead.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley: Nicky, you mentioned the (expectation) [ph] of pricing would start to [indiscernible], what about the other side of the equation, raw materials, it looks like raw materials are pretty flat year-over-year in 2Q, I am just wondering what you see in terms trends in some of your key raw materials?\nNick Gangestad: Nigel, on the raw material front, we\u2019ve been seeing our raw material prices in aggregate drop between 1.5% and 2%. We saw that in the first two quarters of the year. We expect that to continue and if you think back to the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year, we expect the raw materials to benefit us by $0.05 to $0.15 for the year. We still see ourselves in that range probably tracking closer to the high end in that range.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley: Okay, so is the raw material still down year-over-year in the second of the half of the year?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Nigel.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley: Okay and then secondly on the ERP, just wondered if you could maybe just talk about where [indiscernible] plan on the rollout for this year. I know that the early phases resulted in lower corporate as you work in cost more to the segments. I know the corporate was a little bit lower year-over-year. I am wondering is the EPR continuing to have that impact particularly in corporate segments.\nInge Thulin:\n : Yes, we on plan relative to the rollout. We have talked about earlier. I have rolled out now in five countries around the world. We have in addition to that rolled out four distribution centers in West Europe or Central East Europe, so we have done one in UK, we have done one in France. We have done one in Poland. And yes, beginning of this month, we rollout the biggest one which is in (J\u00fcchen) [ph] in Germany, our biggest distribution center in West Europe.  And I was in fact myself over there, yes, the week before and then follow-up slightly after that and walked the floors relative to make sure with the team that we were prepared for that to cutover and I am very pleased to say, it\u2019s going very well relative to that execution.  So, I will say that even as you know when you make those moves right, you always learn a little bit on every place and we have and I will say, we, yes, take those learnings and we step up our mitigations and the team in place in order to be more effective as we implement as we go ahead.  But in terms of the financials you see then in terms of cost, it\u2019s still accurate, there is no change to that and I will say that as we move ahead probably we will like to make sure we maybe can accelerate some of the implementation in places where we can get even better financial benefits. So maybe not changed a figure in terms of [indiscernible] but see if we can capture something earlier and get more focus around it. But so far so good, but again as you know there is always a little bit of a change management as you do those type of things right, but I think the important thing, the prime metric for us is customer satisfaction.\nNick Gangestad: And Nigel to add, this is Nick. I want to add one point on that. The 30 basis point increase in spending that we\u2019re seeing in our five businesses are from spending that we are now putting into the businesses to do this and this is not a shift between corporate miscellaneous and the businesses. If you\u2019re looking at the corporate miscellaneous piece, the year-on-year change there is really driven by a reduction in our pension expense largely as we had laid out at the beginning of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray - Citi Research: I was hoping to get some more color regarding the growth investments. You said it was a 40 basis point hit that\u2019s broadly across 3M, but how does that impact the individual segments and what kind of return are you expecting on both the pure new products but as well as the restructurings?\nNick Gangestad:\n : Well, Deane, our strategic investments come in -- there is multiple categories there, one is our invest in innovation as you\u2019re alluding to, and that is still an investment mode where we\u2019re working to develop those new technologies for the future and we\u2019re not expecting an accretive benefit to growth from those investments in 2014 and little in 2015.  For the rest of our strategic investment that we\u2019ve talked about, part of that is restructuring and part of that is our incremental investment in business transformation and ERP. Those are tracking approximately where we\u2019ve expected on the restructuring front where about halfway through the year and where we\u2019ve spent about half of what we expect to spend for the year on restructuring. Benefits in the last half of the year, we still see in low single-digit millions of dollars, we expect more benefit from that into the tens of millions of dollars in 2015.\nDeane Dray - Citi Research:  And for Inge, what\u2019s interesting at the very end of your prepared remarks you cited some upside in the business, the Cuno filtration business. There was a big multiple paid in that business a while ago but it looks like it\u2019s beginning to deliver the way you all had envisioned it. So, what is that longer opportunity for Cuno in the portfolio, when you've hinted in the past you might be interested in doing some water investments and how do you see that opportunity?\nInge Thulin :  Well, I think first of all that what we call now purification right is a business that during the last couple of years really improved for us, so let\u2019s put out a little bit of perspective, you talk about when we purchased that the multiple was high and so forth, right. I think initially when that was purchased, we didn\u2019t integrated fast enough into 3M, so if you think about what we are looking for as fundamental growth drivers for every business is around technology, manufacturing, global capabilities and brands. Those are the things that we need to capture when we purchase something. I think in that case we hold and that\u2019s now many years ago but I think we hold it aside too long before we really start to drive the value that 3M will add in those four categories. The last three years that have now taken place and they have done a fantastic job in my mind relative to efficiency and operational excellence, consolidation of manufacturing start to lay in some of the technologies that can help them and then start to use the global capabilities in terms of our footprint. That\u2019s why you now see quarter-on-quarter sequential good growth, there were 13% this quarter was very similar first quarter of this year and in many market we see huge opportunities as we go ahead based on our current portfolio. It\u2019s always difficult to give you a figure as you look upon it but again I go back and say that it\u2019s clear that clean water and clear air is a very important element in most parts of the world and specifically I will say in developing world. And that\u2019s also where we see a fantastic growth rate for this business, so this is a very good space for us and I am very pleased where we stand today with that business and we will continue to invest as we go ahead for more growth and also efficiency into organization.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLaurence Alexander - Jefferies :  Good morning. Two quick questions, your Greater China business, how fast is that growing now and in the comment about the energy related businesses growing only about 1% and telecom being the leading part of that, can you talk about how weak the rest of that business was and were there any other end markets that had decelerated in the quarter?\nInge Thulin:  Well let\u2019s start with what we call China, Hong Kong in terms of that operation. We had in this quarter we moved from Q1, 8% growth to 10% growth in the quarter for China and if you compare that on that base business that was only 1% Q2 last year. So, year-over-year good improvement and over last quarter also slight improvement, so that\u2019s moving forward positively and again you see in businesses there that you take industrial was 13% growth in the quarter, healthcare was 17%, consumer and office 20% and you have safety and graphics just over 10%. So, it\u2019s moving ahead very well and I think we are past the time where China was a 25% growth for the quarter but we are running that now at 10% with slight uptick, so that\u2019s good and we feel good about where we stand today in China. Relative to the energy piece, there is some tender business going on in that business and that can hit us a little bit short, you saw telecom had 4% growth and then some of the other businesses was down but it was not much big figures on the downside. And there is some, I will say tenders that is going because some it is government related and utility related, so it can move a little bit in between quarters but nothing to be really concerned about. And we have one of our Heartland divisions is part of that, so it was not much down, just a little bit. We're very pleased that telecom grew 4% that was a good figure for us.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Sprague - Vertical Research :\n :\n :\n a:\nNick Gangestad:\n : Yes Jeff, on the cash flow and the working capital managing our inventory continues to be one of our important priorities and improving our inventory churns making some progress there we expect more progress on that in the coming quarters. Specifically to your question about business transformation ERP and the impact that could be having over the long term we are convinced that where we\u2019re going with business transformation and ERP that we have significant opportunities to improve our working capital and in particular inventory management and generate benefits there. In the short term in particular in the second quarter with some of our go live activity we had there was minimal I\u2019ll call it in the $10 million to $30 million increased inventory in some of the channel in anticipations of go live activity.\nInge Thulin:   But if Jeff your question was the longer term, it was a little hard to tell on our end. We have talked about a longer term opportunity in working capital but it\u2019s that bigger win is not something we\u2019d expect in the next year or two necessarily. We\u2019ve sized that above 500 million.\nJeff Sprague - Vertical Research : Okay, thank you for the clarification there. And I am just wondering on share repurchase, kind of is there -- we obviously can do the math on the share price and figure out what a dollar buys these days, but is there any additional pressure on just kind of other dilutive effects, options exercises or anything else that kind of heats against that gross number?\nNick Gangestad:   No, there is nothing out of the ordinary there, Jeff, that\u2019s happening on a dilution basis. We did pick up our activity some in the first half of the year, we saw it as good opportunity and on the dilution front very-very similar to trends to what we\u2019ve seen in the last year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nAjay Kejriwal \u2013 FBR Capital Markets: Thank you. Good morning. Just maybe on energy, so the work you\u2019re doing on consolidating the divisions I guess showing in the margins here. So the question is, is this improvement, is this a couple of quarter phenomena or do you think this could be -- there could be runway for couple of years here and the business has been below company margins. So do you think there is opportunity to take margins up to more near the company average levels?\nInge Thulin: Well think about it in this way, we are running around 22% to 23% margin as an enterprise. We have some businesses that is running in the middle of that and you have two that is type of one is higher which is healthcare and then you have electronic and energy that is lower. And as you recall when we started the journey this was around 15 plus, that industry by definition that\u2019s a good margin in that industry by definition and that will always be a differentiation. So I will say that this move from 15% closer to 20% over this period of time was our expectation. If it will go more up in the area of 25% to 30% I don\u2019t think that\u2019s realistic for that market in order for us to do that. But I think any business in 3M our expectation is that you should be close to the average out the company. And our organization there today is more streamlined and I think we are better prepared also to deal with some eventual volatility in that market on the electronic side that we know will come from time to time, that\u2019s part of that business and we train that business so that\u2019s okay.\nAjay Kejriwal \u2013 FBR Capital Markets: Good, that\u2019s helpful. And then Treo, could you maybe provide some color on the margin profile there? And then how should we think about the trajectory and the impact on segment margins, as it kind of integrate that business?\nInge Thulin: Well, first of all, that\u2019s an integration into our healthcare -- health information system, so that business have been growing, the health information system have been growing very well for us the last five to 10 years. And you should think about it in terms of that this acquisition is actually an addition in order for us to get more relevance into different parts of the segment.  So health information system today is a growing business and we are doing that for providers in coding, grouping and analytics. And that\u2019s to the hospital providers. Now we will get access to vast set of payers that then they can help to connect the two of them. So as the model is moving from volume base to quality outcome this is what will help, so I will look upon it as an integrated part of the current business we have and it\u2019s a relatively small business as you know. So, it\u2019s more for us to be able to get access and connect the two entities together.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Good morning everyone. So, my first question is just on price cost, clearly another good quarter above 100 basis points but looks like last time FX was a benefit. Can you just quantify the tailwind that you got in the quarter from FX on the price cost basis?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Joe thanks for that question, for the quarter on the top-line we really saw no impact from FX, everything netted out to nothing. What we're seeing is a negative impact on our margin this year, year-on-year is a fact that we had significant hedging gains a year ago as part of our strategy and the lack of those gains is causing that margin year-on-year erosion, margin erosion, really has nothing to do with 2014. It has to do with the gain we took last year on our hedging.\nMatt Ginter: Joe, as part of your question, how much price we have gotten due to currency?\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs: Yes, that\u2019s right, Matt. \nNick Gangestad: As we've said last quarter about half of our price we really see as currency related and we think that will be running its course soon. We instituted a lot of price increases related to currency in the middle of last year and so that\u2019s the primary driver why we're saying we expect that price growth to moderate in the last half of 2014.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs: Okay, that\u2019s helpful, Nick and one follow-up may be for Inge. Inge you mentioned that you brought down your growth expectations for LatAm. It looks like you had negative volume growth in the quarter and so may be if you could just provide some positives and may be areas of weaknesses that you are seeing in a region today?\nInge Thulin: Yes, Latin America, first of all we have probably the best portfolio mix in that part of the world, and so we feel very good relative to our overall platform as we move ahead and as you know we have been doing business in Latin America since I think 1946 was when we started in Brazil. When you look upon it now, there was a little bit of temper specifically in Brazil I will say, Brazil was flat to down, Mexico was up 12%. So, I would say Brazil had an impact for different reasons and then for us at least what we are selling personal safety into the mining was also on the lower end. So, I think that Brazil was for us the downturn this quarter specifically and then Canada was flat. You have Latin America/Canada together, Canada flat, Brazil down, most other up and Mexico up 12%. But as I said this is a part of the world that is the most developed of our developing regions and we know how to do business there. So, step up for me always when I look upon Latin America over the years and I follow that as I led international for eight years before I came into this job. We have a constant growth over time in Latin America but that could be a little bit of dip in a quarter but that\u2019s not the overall concern for us. We are just short term stay the course and capitalize on the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Tusa - JPMorgan : Good morning. Just on the price cost thing on the deflation I guess on your raw materials. How much of that, I guess you said to 100 to 150 basis points for the first half, how much was it precisely in the second quarter and then how much of that do you think is blocking and tackling and kind of structural like every year you can kind of bang out certain amount of that, it just seem to be kind of a nice tailwind for a while now?\nNick Gangestad: I appreciate that question because it gives me a chance to make it clear here that the benefits we see on raw materials are not just a passive benefit that 3M gets by being in the market. There are some benefits we get thanks to the market but a lot of this, Steve, is driven by what our sourcing team is doing in 3M to bring about those benefits. So, of that total 1.2%, 1.3% benefit that we're seeing in the second quarter, there is a portion of that that\u2019s raw materials probably a little less than half of that that\u2019s raw material driven. And that raw material portion is made up of several components. One is just outright market conditions where we're enjoying that benefit. Second is what we're doing from a 3M perspective to drive those benefits and use our power in the market to benefit there and then the third is, there is a portion of that that involves us substituting one raw material for another to 3M's advantage. So it\u2019s a broad perspective of what\u2019s driving that number, Steve.\nStephen Tusa - JPMorgan: So I guess out of the 1.2 to 1.3 how much is just maybe to narrow it down, how much is it market exposure related half like 25% of that or?\nNick Gangestad:\n : I think it\u2019s around half, Steve, as we looked at the raw material deflation this quarter. Yes, you could think of it and it varies a little bit from period to period, but it\u2019s about half market and half due to the additional value we can add.\nStephen Tusa - JPMorgan: That\u2019s very helpful and then one just quick follow-up on electronics. The cycles have been kind of notoriously tough to predict in, I am not sure if there is a good way to forecast this, but how do you feel about the growth there in the second half, I mean sequentially it was definitely stronger than we were expecting it up high single digits, should we think about normal seasonality in the back half of the year and what's your sense of kind of inventory the customer decision again?\nNick Gangestad:\n : You start on the inventory side. We don\u2019t see any build up in the channel so I think that it\u2019s at a normal level as in the past. So if we start there based on your last point of your question, otherwise I will say look it like you can think about it in normal way all the season, but also for us we work with all suppliers in that industry. And it will all be dependent on the end market demand in the end, so for us definitely will be the growth driver or less growth driver as we move head. But I don\u2019t think there is any change for us at this point in time relative to the outlook for the growth of electronics and energy in that business.\nStephen Tusa - JPMorgan: Hey, guys, one last quick one just on the -- you have an easier comp in the third quarter, tougher comp in the fourth quarter on growth or I think maybe other way around, but anything than the comps that moves around as far as stability of growth rates in the second half?\nNick Gangestad:\n : Are you talking electronics or total companies?\nStephen Tusa - JPMorgan: No, just total 3M organic, looks like the midpoint averages around 4% growth that maybe conservative or not, but should one quarter be better than the other because of the comparisons?\nNick Gangestad:\n : No, I think -- you can think about it in the following way. If you go back to 2013, first half we had 2% organic local currency growth. Second part, we had 4%. First part of this year, we are close to 5. And I think you should think about this we move ahead for the year that based on the range we\u2019re giving is 3 to 6, so I think it would be very much in that range for the last quarter.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.\nMatt Ginter:\n : I would like to thank everybody for joining us today. We appreciate your engagement and interest in 3M.

Inge and David will make some opening comments today and then we will take your questions. Before we begin I've a few brief announcements. Our remaining 2014 earnings calls are scheduled for Thursday, July 24, Thursday, October 23 and Thursday, January 29. Also, please hold the morning of Tuesday, December 16 on your calendars for our next investor meeting, the details of which will be available later this year.

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. The first quarter was strong for 3M; marked by organic growth in all business groups and across all geographic areas. We posted record sales in return record cash to shareholders, by also increasing investments in R&D and commercialization to reinforce our foundation for long-term success. Let's look at the few highlights earnings per share rose to $1.79, an 11.2% increase year-over-year. Sales were $7.8 billion the highest first quarter total in 3M history. Organic growth was 4.6% paced by our health care business at 6%. Industrial, Safety and Graphics each grew 5% organically. We saw organic growth in each geographic area led by Asia Pacific and Latin America/Canada at 7% each. Europe, Middle East, Africa grew 4% followed by the United States at 3%. I'm very encouraged by our continued broad based organic growth, which is more evident that is our strategies are working. Currency reduced sales by 2% in the quarter, which was about 1% points worse than our expectation entering the year. Operating margins were again strong at nearly 22% up 30 basis point from last year. Four of our five business groups reported margins greater than 21%. It remains a good time to be a 3M shareholder. The company returned $2.3 billion to its shareholders to cash dividends and share repurchases. We increased our first quarter dividend by 35%, which marked 56 consecutive annual increase. In summary, the first quarter was a solid start to 2014. This is only possible because of the hard work of our entire 3M team on a global basis because of the efforts, we continue to deliver consistent and strong results today, while at the same time investing and building for the future. Now please turn to Slide number 4. With one quarter behind us, we are reaffirming our earnings and organic growth outlook for the full year. Earnings per share are expected in the range to $7.30 to $7.55 with organic local-currency sales growth in the 3% to 6% range. We now anticipate foreign currency translation to reduce full year sales by approximately 1%, a slightly bigger headwind than previous expectations. Our tax rate estimate remains at 28% to 29% with cash flow conversion at 90% to 100%. David will now take you through the details of the first quarter. David?\nDavid Meline: Thank you, Inge. I'll begin by reviewing first quarter sales growth. Please turn to Slide number 5. Worldwide organic local-currency grew was 4.6% in the first quarter with volumes up 3.4% and selling prices up 1.2%. We continue to experience positive selling price changes across our businesses. Boosted by world-class innovation and strong new production flow both of which are important elements of the 3M business model. In addition, we've been raising prices in certain developing countries to help offset the impact of currency devaluations. Foreign exchange impacts reduced worldwide sales by 2% points in the first quarter and as Inge mentioned this was about 1% point worse than we expected at the beginning of the year. The most significant currency headwinds were in Latin America/Canada had negative 12% as several countries in the area experienced devaluations. Currency impacts were negative 4% in Asia Pacific and a positive 2% in EMEA. On the total US Dollar basis sales rose 2.6% versus the first quarter of 2013. Looking by area, demand accelerated in Asia Pacific in the first quarter with organic local currency growth of 7%. Growth was led by strong double-digit performance in Japan where demand was elevated leading up to the April consumption tax increase. China, Hong Kong grew 2% organically in Q1 or 8% excluding electronics. On a business basis, all five groups within Asia Pacific generated positive organic local currency growth in Q1 led by health care and safety and graphics. Latin America/Canada also grew 7% organically, a nice acceleration versus the fourth quarter. Growth was led by solid double-digit performances in Brazil and Mexico; our two largest Latin American subsidiaries in terms of sales. All five businesses posted positive organic growth in Latin America/Canada during the quarter including double-digit growth in health care. Electronics and energy also posted solid organic, local-currency growth in the area. In Venezuela, we continue to manage through the economic turbulence and position our business for future success. Sales and profits were down substantially in Venezuela during the quarter. We continue to manage our exposures carefully and we will stay on this path until the situation improves. For some time now, we have been actively managing towards a neutral net monitory asset position in Venezuela and at this point, it appears that any major event risk is behind us. Organic sales growth in EMEA was 4% in the first quarter continuing the positive trends that we have seen over the past few quarters. West Europe grew 3% with strong performances in Nordic, Alpine and Iberia regions. Middle East Africa also posted strong organic growth in the quarter. On a business basis, growth in EMEA was strongest in industrial and in safety and graphics. In the United States organic local-currency growth was 3% in the quarter, which was a bit slower than the growth we saw in the second half of 2013. It does appear that weather negatively impacted certain channels that we serve in the US, particularly in road construction, retail and industrial distribution. On the positive side, health care posted the strongest US growth amongst our five businesses. Organic local-currency growth was nearly 5% across all developing markets and 4.5% in developed markets and again as Inge mentioned organic growth was positive across all major geographic areas. Let's turn to Slide number 6, for discussion of the first quarter income statement. Sales for the quarter were $7.8 billion up 2.6% in dollar terms. Gross profit rose 3.7% to $3.8 billion and gross margins increased 0.5% points to 48.5%. SG&A spending increased in line with sales growth and R&D as a percent of sales rose by 20 basis points to 5.8%. Operating income increased by just over 4% versus the first quarter of 2013. GAAP operating margins were 21.9% up 30 basis points year-on-year. Organic volume growth added 30 basis points to margins and the combination of lower raw material cost and higher selling prices contributed a positive 110 basis points year-on-year. And inherent part of 3M's business model is to leverage productivity and other gains to fund strategic investments, while continuing to generate premium returns. This is seen again in our first quarter numbers. We invested the equivalent of 90 basis points of margin on incremental programs around disruptive R&D, business transformation, and ERP, and restructuring. In particular, we invested $40 million on restructuring and other realignment efforts in Q1 across a number of business units. Lower year-on-year pension and OPEB expense boosted first quarter margins by 50 basis points, while foreign exchange impacts reduce margins by 50 basis points. All in first quarter earnings increased 11% to $1.79 per share. Foreign currency impacts reduced first quarter earnings per share by $0.04 and the lower tax rate resulted in a $0.04 per share benefit. As a result of our announced changes in capital structure strategy, average diluted shares outstanding declined by 4% versus last year's first quarter, which added $0.07 to first quarter earnings per share. In summary, the first quarter was a good start to the year in 2014. Organic sales growth was broadly positive across businesses and geographies. Margins were strong overall and we expect this performance to continue into the future. Now let's turn to cash flow, turning to Slide number 7. As a reminder for those, who are new to 3M; we announced at our December 2013 Investor Meeting, our plans to manage towards a better optimized capital structure going forward, and to allocate capital accordingly. The strength and stability of our business model and strong free cash flow capability, enables us to enact this changes while continuing to invest in our businesses. Organic growth remains our first priority, so we will continue to invest in CapEx, R&D and commercialization capability. In addition, we're already enabled to respond to strategic acquisition opportunities that can strengthen our portfolio, and at the same time our plan affords us the opportunity to return significant cash to shareholders. We communicated our intent to implement these changes to our capital structure overtime. For the calendar year 2014 in particular, we expect to add leverage of $2 billion to $4 billion on the balance sheet. So now let's discuss our cash flow performance for the first quarter. We generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter up $98 million versus last year's first quarter. Higher net income drove the line share of the increase. Capital expenditures were $293 million, a decrease of $31 million versus last year. We continue to expect full year CapEx will be in the range to $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. First quarter free cash flow was $799 million, up $129 million year-on-year and we converted 66% of net income to cash versus 59% in last year's comparable quarter. Note that, first quarter is typically our seasonal low with respect to free cash flow conversion. For the full year 2014, we expect to be in the range 90% to 100%. We paid $566 million in cash dividends during the quarter up substantially over the $440 million paid in 2013. As Inge mentioned earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 35%. Gross share repurchases were $1.7 billion in the first quarter for 2014 we expect full year gross share repurchases will be in the range $4 billion to $5 billion. Let's now review our first quarter performance on a business-by-business basis. Please go the Slide number 8. Our industrial business posted strong first quarter results with $2.8 billion in sales and 5% organic local currency growth. Leading the way this quarter was our 3M Purification business which drove strong double-digit organic growth. This business has gained significant traction around the globe, as we expand our technology capability and product offerings. We also generated double-digit organic growth in automotive OEM, which was more than twice the rate of growth in global auto production. Our advanced materials and industrial abrasive businesses also posted nice first quarter organic growth. Industrial sales grew broadly across all geographic areas during the quarter. Organic local currency sales growth was 6% in both EMEA and Latin America/Canada. 5% in Asia Pacific and 3% in the US. First quarter operating income was $618 million up 7% year-on-year. Operating margins increased 80 basis points to 22.3%. Margins were boosted by volume leverage, positive price raw's and good productivity, partially offset by restructuring cost. We also improved margins year-on-year in Ceradyne, a business we acquired in late 2012 which added 30 basis points to industrial margins in Q1. Please turn to Slide 9. Safety and Graphic sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter with organic local currency sales growth of 5%. Our largest business here is personal safety, which generated double-digit organic local-currency growth. We also grew in a roofing granules and commercial solutions businesses. Sales in traffic safety and security systems declined slightly on organic basis, impacted by slow start to the road construction season. Safety and graphics grew organically in all major geographic areas with Asia Pacific up 9%, Latin America/Canada and EMEA each up 5% and the US up 2%. Operating income was $318 million in the first quarter and operating margin were a solid 22.3%, although margins were down year-on-year versus a very strong comp. Major factors impacting, this quarter's margins were higher ERP investment, restructuring and negative currency impacts. Please go to Slide 10. Our health care business once again delivered outstanding results. It was our fastest growing and highest margin business group in the first quarter. Sales were $1.4 billion and increased 6% in organic local currency terms. All businesses contributed this growth in the first quarter led by health information systems, food safety and drug delivery systems. All geographic areas generated positive organic local-currency sales growth with Latin America/Canada up 12%. Asia Pacific up 10%, the US up 7% and EMEA up 2% in the quarter. In developing markets health care grew 10% organically in the first quarter, yet another in a long string of double-digit performances. First quarter operating income in health care was $427 million and operating margins increased 30 basis year-on-year to 31.1%. Now let's look at electronics and energy found on Slide 11. First quarter sales in this business were $1.3 billion up 4% in organic local-currency terms. Electronics related sales increased 5% on an organic local-currency basis with positive growth in optical films partially offset by declines in other businesses. In our energy related business, sales increased 2% organically led by renewable energy in telecom. On a geographic basis organic local-currency sales increased 9% in Latin America/Canada and 7% in Asia Pacific. EMEA was down slightly and the United States declined 4% year-on-year. Operating income rose 16% to $227 million and operating margins were 17.3%. Margins in this business continue to track higher rising 2 points year-on-year and 60 basis points sequentially. Volume leverage and improving productivity were both positive contributors to first quarter margins. Finally, let's review the consumer business found on Slide number 12. Sales in the consumer business grew $1.1 billion with organic local-currency growth of 3%. Sales in our stationary and office supply business declined versus last year's first quarter. Store traffic in the US office retail channel was softer in the quarter, due in part to harsh winter weather conditions along with continued store consolidations. Our construction and home improvement business which serves the DIY retail market space led consumer's growth this quarter with high single-digit organic local currency sales growth. Over the years, we have built strong market positions in categories such as Filtrete brand, home furnace filters, Scotch-Brite, painters tape and Command brand mounting and fastening products, which provide a strong foundation for consistent strong growth. On a geographic basis, organic local-currency growth was 6% in Asia Pacific, 5% Latin America/Canada and 1% each in the US and EMEA. Operating income was $228 million with operating margins of 21.2%, that concludes my first quarter related comments and I'll turn the call back over to Inge.\nInge Thulin: Thank you David. As you can see, the year is off to a good start. We continue to execute well against our long-term strategic levels, which I would like to update you on. Let's first start with portfolio management. In the first quarter, we realigned and combined certain businesses to increase customer relevance, build scale and generate cost efficiency. In the Safety and Graphic business group, we merged commercial graphics and building and commercial services into newly formed commercial solutions division. This brings a comprehensive array of branding, design, protection and maintenance solutions under one division allowing us to present one strong voice to the commercial markets customers. Earlier this month, we also further realigned our electronics related businesses to more effectively position them to accelerate growth. We are now organizer on two large divisions. One is display materials and systems, which consolidates all of 3M's capabilities in electronic displays. [Batteries] electronics material solutions which aligns our offerings in semi-conductor electronic materials and components. This changes will better align our capabilities with customers needs and expand our leadership in this area. Also in April, 3M acquired Treo Solutions, a leader in the health care, data analytics. This will bolster our health information system business by allowing it to supply customers with better solutions at lower cost. Let's talk about the second lever, investing in innovation. Innovation is the heartbeat of 3M. It drives what we do every day and allow us to create even greater value for customers. Innovation generates new growth and is the key to our long track record of generating premium returns throughout the business. In fact, one-third of our revenue in 2013 came from products created in the last five years and we are targeting 37% by 2017. And we expanding our innovation capabilities globally, we have now built 45 innovation centers around the world, where customer gain exposure to the breadth of our technology. Our international labs are also typically staffed and led by local nationals and our commitment to innovation helps 3M recruit some of the best and brightest scientists from all over the globe. It's notable that 47% of our new products launched in 2013, were led by international labs up from 37% just a few years ago. The results were strong with more opportunities still to come. Now let's talk about the third lever; business transformation. We continue to make progress on implementing our global ERP system, which will lead to more a ideal and efficient 3M. To-date, we have gone live in five countries with more schedule for 2014. Most recently, we launched is it, that is in one of our European distribution center based in Dabrowa, Poland. We are learning more with each implementation on using that knowledge to guide and refined our future work. There is one final point I'd like to make before taking your questions. When we last met in January, I talked a bit about our 3M manage to a volatility in developing markets. Given down certainties in some areas of the world today. I like to expand a bit upon that discussion. We have a deep history in developing nations. 3M entered Brazil in 1946 and a year later, 1947 in Mexico. With that history comes wealth of experience and business teams that know how to be successful in those areas. This is also the model; we are using in Central East Europe, Middle East, Africa and APAC. This is the 3M international model. We enter early, develop connections grow our customer base and steadily build capability. We staff our management teams with local nationals, people who know the country, culture and customers and of course speak the language. As with any growth opportunity, there are going to be challenges along the way and developing markets are no exception, yet when these challenges arise we do not abandon our customers or the market. Our leaders know how to manage through them, knowing from experience that 3M will emerge even stronger with a more established presence and more loyal customer base. Our approach continue to produce strong results including this year's first quarter. In Brazil, as one example we grew 11% organically and in Mexico 15% and we see developing countries coming back in terms of growth rate. Developing markets in total represents 35% of 3M's sales today and we expect that number to keep climbing. Thank you for your attention and with that, we are now ready to take your questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line Andrew Obin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin: Good morning, just a broad question. As I look at 3M, you guys delivered another quarter of some of the best top line growth in the industry and if you look at the margin expansion. You're actually starting to get it, but then if you look at the operating line the leverage seems to be limited and I understand it's a functional some of it discretionary spending that you guys are doing. So two questions; A, what is the level, what is run rate of discretionary spending that we should be expecting for the rest of the year? And second a broader question, sort of 3M seems to be a combo and industrial company and a consumer company, but your operating leverage now behaves a lot more like consumer company than an industrial company. Do we get sort of operating leverage on the industrial side by some point this year? Thank you.\nDavid Meline: Yes, thanks Andrew. So in terms of the leverage we get from growth. We saw in the first quarter, I think very typical of what we've expect from the overall business which is somewhere 35% to 40% operating leverage on the growth that we got and what's true as you pointed out and as we had planned, we do plan to reinvest a significant portion of that in some of these key strategic investments through 2014. So we have said in the beginning of the year that we expect to invest in these investments program somewhere between $0.10 to $0.20 during the year and we invested $0.07 a share in the first quarter. So we still expect to invest at that $0.10 to $0.20 range probably towards the high end, the way it looks right now, but what you can expect through the year is that you'll see some moderation of that spending. So obviously, the business transformation and the R&D investment is pretty steady through the year. We also invested, we did some restructuring in the first quarter that we'll look at each quarter and determine, whether or not there are projects that we should undertake and also some of the spending was in this European supply chain center of excellence, which will lap that spending here as we move into the second quarter.\nAndrew Obin: Just on structural, I understand that you need to invest and it's part of the culture, but as I said should we see more operating more top line dropping to the bottom line in the second half of the year, is that a reasonable expectation given what you've stated?\nDavid Meline: Yes, I mean if you look at the plan we laid out for the year. What you could foresee, is that we will some inept increase in our margins for the year, which we did see already here in the first quarter. So I think it's fair to assume that will continue as we look through the full year.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Winoker: The 50 basis point increase in gross margin and when I look at the gross margin overall. The highest, I think since that was 6 certainly for a long time and you peaked in that earlier time period over 50%. I know we are having sort of the discussion about investments below the gross margin line, but is most of that increase on the pricing versus raw material front and how do you think about this sustainability. I mean clearly you have a lot of pricing power and you're making up for some inflationary issues, but when you sort of look at your material cost position, cost out and continue pricing efforts, are there other things going on there in the volume leverage etcetera and we can sort of see that number also continue to tick up for some time.\nDavid Meline: You're right, Steve. We were encouraged this quarter by the improvement in our gross margin which seasonally for us, the first quarter is usually the lowest of the year. So that was encouraging, if we look year-over-year. What's true, it's a combination of several factors. Certainly productivity features in that and you've heard us really focus in these last couple of years around the rejuvenation and taking segment to the next level and, so we are seeing I think some of that coming through. Certainly, we've been working the portfolio to focus resources where the best opportunities are and I think that's certainly contributing to the overall gross margin profitability of the company and then finally, there certainly as you know and as you pointed out. There is component of price in raw material that's supporting this. On the pricing side, we had quite strong pricing in the first quarter down a little bit from the fourth quarter but nonetheless quite strong at 1.2% and if you'll look at about half of was that attributable to the freshness of the product portfolio and really the price value relationship that our customers described to those products and the other half, was largely attributable to offsetting the foreign exchange movements in particular in the emerging market. So as a combination of several factors, but obviously it's something we continue to focus on and seek to improve.\nSteven Winoker: That's great and Inge. You've talked less about it, yet another organizational set of changes internally that just sound like a continued large transformation going on. Are these latest ones that you talked about today? I mean, how much \u2013 it sounds like it\u2019s all channel driven but you're also going reap some cost synergy benefits from it? So there are other elements besides the channel and customer facing front here that will be, we can see the benefits from overtime?\nInge Thulin: First of all, if you go back when we lay out our six new strategies when I took office. A little bit more than two years ago, the first strategy is to calling out relevance to customers and this is the implementation of that. So when you have the strategy, you need to follow through in order to make sure that you on the way to obtain your overall or be active. So some of this changes that we've done is clearly based on relevance to customers for us to be able to respond faster based on their needs, where you know as you know that our technology platforms are very important and we need to be able to respond fast back to them based on solutions, we are working with them. In my mind, as we not have looked into the organization structure maybe for almost 10 years, there was some disconnect in between our internal organization in the market, so we are addressing that. And of course, so drive it first from relevance to customer, to market, but there is also cost benefits of course into organization structure, as you make those moves because you reduced specifically in the back office and in the middle management, where you can reduce cost and be more ideal and so forth. So if you think about it from a speed perspective because we would like to accelerate speed in terms of responsiveness to customers. We have in some parts of the world, that we have not talked about now for long time also consolidate subsidiaries into region in the part of West Europe and we have done in Latin America, etc. So if you think about that, well you now have connection points where we previously in some cases said three sizeable but not huge divisions that needed to interact. For instance, in Nordic with four different countries where we today have one-to-one. So you have one huge division totally focused in market space and you have one geographical area in Nordic that's incredible move and shift if you think about speed in order to execute, when you went from three Vice President's back in St. Paul and four Managing Director, Nordic. Now you go one-for-one, I can tell you that has an incredible impact on the organization in terms of speed as we move ahead. So look upon it like increased relevance in the front end for the customers and for us also to be able to leverage cost in our structure both in international and in the center of the organization.\nSteven Winoker: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Begleiter: Inge and David, are you able to break out the weather impacts in Q1 and if so, how much of those are permanent and how much will be recaptured in future quarters?\nInge Thulin: Well first of all, it's difficult in a way to talk about it because we are global company. So some places around the world, the weather was okay. So I think and you think about it that was some impact in United States and United States is 35% of our business. So it's difficult for us to quantify it, but of course we had some impact of it in United States specifically and it was related to as David said, was traffic in the stores was down which had an impact on our consumer business and that was also delayed in some of the construction and specific relative to traffic, safety and road safety. If you take road safety and traffic safety. I think that will come back. It's a timing issue, so we will get that back as we go. If you go into the combination of the lower traffic in the stores the first quarter that's maybe gone but we will compensate that in a different way, but you know we don't talk much about weather to be honest, right it's -- we are global company and the sun is always shining somewhere and that is what we need to capitalize on.\nDavid Meline: If I can, just add briefly David. So if you will look at the US from a trend growth perspective. We saw in the second half of last year, we grew around 4.5% during that period and we've got guidance in place for the year of 3% to 6% for the US and we grew 3% in the first quarter. So it feels to us, the guidance is still right and that we will some recovery, as we move through the year.\nDavid Begleiter: And just lastly, of the two segments posted year-over-year or any declines in safety and consumer. Do you think they can return to earnings growth in second quarter?\nDavid Meline: Yes, we think that we've got and outlook for both of those businesses to grow again with the average of the company for the year in the 3% to 6% and we think that their margins will operate around the company average, so that would imply some improvement in consumer and probably in the safety and graphics. If you look seasonally, they run a little bit lower in the first quarter typically anyway.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Do you guys, when you think about pricing. I think 3M has a history of being pretty good on price particularly the last five years or so, but is there a trade-off that you see, a clear trade-off between price and volume. Do you have a sense, that you're giving up volume and do you have so much pricing power in most of your businesses that it's fairly immaterial that, it's more of a next issues, it's just a better product.\nInge Thulin: Yes, we don't feel at this point in time that we are giving up volume. You have to think about it in terms of our position in the market and all the new products that we are introducing, as many of them are based [specking] on platforms etc. So I will not say that, we're at this point in time or giving up anything that we are aware of and as you know, our power in terms of pricing is pretty strong. And it's all based on, of the value of the solution that we are providing. So I think that's important, so I don't think that's a issue. If we had been, we had not continued to execute based on our strategy in that area. I think it's more in terms of you talking about growth generally speaking, is maybe in some part of in the developing world that we will add different type of products and solutions that on meeting. I will say that, their price points and affordability in that part of the world, but that's a different discussion because that's more around the product portfolio that you're introducing in developing economies and I think that, we still have huge opportunities and as you heard, I talked about now that we have build out our capabilities with 45 customer technical centers around the world, that's exactly what we can capitalize on. So for us, it's important to make sure that we develop product that are adding value but also affordable for that market but we still have a very high expectation relative to our margins in the company and we are not giving up on that. So you should earn your right in order to introduce products with lower margin. You have to find a different way to produce them and make sure that you get the margins that we expect and that we can prospect you as a shareholder.\nScott Davis: Okay, that's a good answer. It seemed in this presentation as I'm looking at Slide 7. There's new emphasis not a new I should say, but at least an increased emphasis on acquisitions. You cite that, there's a line here says, multibillion dollar deals possible. When I think of 3M and your margin profile and the technology you're having. The stuff available out there realistically that you could buy without having to pay enormous multiples and I think 3M type of assets. The things have been bid up so highly 15 to 20 times EBITDA. I mean, it would be difficult to do this types of deals. I would image but, is it realistic to it to assume that you can find things that are interesting that have the margin structure and the growth structure that you're looking for?\nInge Thulin: Well again, it's coming but first of all you're right when you correct yourself. It's not the new emphasis. We've done acquisition, quite a number of acquisitions over the years, right? I think the new one and very good thing for all of us is that based on the portfolio management, we are putting place. We get a very good profile of where we should invest first, there's a second as we move ahead. I think the biggest acquisition 3M had done over is a $1 billion or so and in some spaces in order for us to be more relevant. We maybe need to do slightly bigger than that, as we move ahead. As you saw, we didn't execute on acquisitions last year and the reason for that was that, we couldn't find any added value for all of us, but I can tell you our pipeline is strong. We are working it for each business and let's see what is happening as we move ahead, but in order for us to build out relevance in some cases. We have to look up interesting spaces first.\nDavid Meline: I guess, I would also add Scott that. I mean, it would be quite unusual as you observe that we would find companies that have the type of profitability in performance that 3M, but that's very typical. We'll look at targets will identify, how we can create value by bringing them into the portfolio and leverage either technologies or brands our global distribution and when we do those transactions litmus test for us, is to become convinced ourselves that we can take a business and turn it into a 3M like performing business, which we've done very successfully over the years in a number of different instances. So that's either the challenge or the opportunity certainly.\nScott Davis: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura. Please proceed with your question.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Just maybe a little bit more on some of the moving parts on managing currency in the quarter. I mean, first of all, to get to this neutral position in Venezuela, did you have to take a head to get your remaining receivable out of there and then the positive price in Asia Pac, which never happens, is that an FX dynamic?\nDavid Meline: First on Venezuela, yes we actually as I mention in the commentary. We did see a slowdown in sales and income that we generated on the ground, in that the availability of currency of imports is been pretty non-existent since already the fourth quarter. So that caused to slowdown in the business, what's also true for us as we've been able to maintain as I mentioned here neutral monetary asset position and therefore as it relates to both the local balance sheet as well as the exposure we've got from offshore. We were able to manage through that and we don't see that being risk as we sit here today and of course things can always change, but we feel much better today than we did last time we were on the call, there months ago. And then in Asia Pacific, could you repeat the question?\nShannon O'Callaghan: Well, I mean price was positive in Asia Pac, which is pretty unusual, I didn't know if that was in price increase related to offsetting some type of FX or that's unrelated.\nDavid Meline: We have had some pricing pressure in some of the countries out of experienced evaluation over the last year. So that would be a portion and what's also true right now is in a number of our product areas. The price value relationship of some of the new product, we are launching is been very strong. So we were encouraged by the performance there this quarter.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Just on kind of your current assessment of the global economy. Volumes in every region except the US improved this quarter. US sounded like it was mainly weather related, are you encouraged by that? I mean do you feel like improving momentum or is it more of a comp thing. Maybe just a little more color about what you're hearing from the businesses globally and how encouraged you might be or not be?\nInge Thulin: Well I think, first of all of course encouraged in the way that the growth is, it looked like steady for us. Now if you look upon our performance here the last couple of quarters, it have improved for us right and as you say, it's going up and down in some parts of the world. I will say that, APAC it came back slightly. So APAC is, I would say the same position as we've had before. They had a good growth in the quarter for us slightly better than Q1 and how they ended a year. West Europe grew 3%, which is equal to how they ended back 2013, so that's a 3% and it looked like the combination in Europe, what we've talked about before about North and South is not very much equalized, right. So looked like 3% is steady growth there. Central East Europe, Middle East. I was certain Middle East, Africa had a good growth for Central East Europe slightly lower in the quarter where you could see that some business or countries did well like Turkey had higher growth rate than you saw in Russia and Poland. United States personally, I'm not overly concerned was 3% growth for the quarter. We start at slower and came back stronger in the quarter and that's related to what David talked about relative to traffics and stores and delay in construction. Specifically in the road side for us. So I think its look like we are going sideways slightly, up but not much, right? So I think we need, neither one but two quarters here to see, if it's moving on a high run, but as we said we are firming our growth rate for the year. So we feel, yes there you have the answer. Encouraged and I look upon it, rather better than was.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Okay, thanks a lot guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nAjay Kejriwal: So on health care, you're continuing to see very nice growth here in developing markets and I know in the past, you've talked about new products and penetration and all that. So maybe just, help us with, where are you in terms of penetration. How much runway do still have there and the sense of sustainability of this double-digit growth rate that you're seeing here?\nInge Thulin: Well, as you saw health care grew 6%, right? And if you separate out developed was 5% and developing 10%. And you think about the mix for us, it's like developed is almost 80% and we are 20% in developing. So already there, you have the answer relative to big opportunity in the developing world, as we move ahead. Now we have very sophisticated solutions in our business in health care, which is one of the reason why we are able to continue to grow in developed word and to very attractive margins and the pipeline of new products is very strong for us in health care, if that's in hospital consumables with fastening systems related to our dressing business or if it's in infection prevention, we're becoming new measurements tools start that will increase the time for measuring what they're doing in the infection area by 50%. We have a very strong pipeline of product going on there. So I will say that, think about it like developed word, we are able to continue our growth and margins due to very good added value products, which is needed in an environment where there is pressure on cost and then in the developing word for us it to, start to implement the penetration plans that we now have been working on for quite some time and in addition developed products that will meet the needs from a price perspective in some of the countries there. They never have a problem with a quality of products, as you assume. When you look upon our Tegaderm products, or Micropore tapes or [indiscernible] products. The problem is never quality, the problem is affordability and there is different ways for us to go around that. So we are very, we see very positive on our health care business and as you see again this quarter very good result and it's not by accident. You know, as you said business we are build out for many, many years and there is lot to come relative to our future in health care.\nDavid Meline: I'd just add, Ajay. I think another piece of evidence that supports that is not only the consistent high level of growth, but again for example this quarter double-digit growth in a number of different countries Brazil, Mexico. If you're looking Southeast Asia, if you're looking China. So if you saw it in one place concentrated you might be less confident but as we see it individually across all of these markets. It's very encouraging as to the opportunity and sustainability of the growth.\nAjay Kejriwal: That's good. Maybe couple clarifications on restructuring you mentioned $40 million investment in the quarter. Is that included in the $0.07 growth related investment you mentioned and then if you can help us with a full year number, what should be modeling in for restructuring?\nDavid Meline: Yes, so the answer first of all is yes inside of the $0.07 the share, we have $40 million. It was a combination of restructuring primarily in some of our operations in Europe as well as the cost year-over-year increase of this European supply chain which as I mentioned will lap that increase, now as we get into the second quarter. So that's piece one. Piece two is; if you look at the total of the combination of the longer term investments in R&D and business transformation plus these items of restructuring and repositioning. We expect that, we had said $0.10 to $0.20 a share for the year and as I mentioned earlier, it looks now like will be towards the high end of that $0.20 range, with some front loading in the first quarter. So you can think about it declining somewhat, as we move through the year.\nAjay Kejriwal: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Sprague: Just two quick cleanups for me. First on electronics, you noted China, Hong Kong was kind of strong ex-electronics but your electronics performance overall actually looked okay, pretty decent. Can you just kind of reconcile those dynamics and a little more color on what's going on in the electronics part of the business?\nInge Thulin: Look upon electronics specifically relative to APAC in total. So we had 5% growth there and that business is type of moving in between countries from time-to-time. So for China and Japan specifically was type of opposite perspective. They have [coms], that in one case was easy and the other case was tough. So easier for Japan, tougher for China so that's the answer and then this quarter specifically much more business went into Japan in terms of our sales but later converting around Asia. So that's the answer to that question. So if you take China for us, best business there was 8% growth which is slightly better than fourth quarter for us and slightly better year-on-year. So China was okay, when you look up the total electronic markets. When we look upon semi-conductor, data storage, smartphone, notebook, tablets, T.V., etc. The market generally speaking went sideways I think in terms of volume. That, you had of course tables going up and capitalize on notebooks in terms of the volume generally speaking. So for us, we are in all those devices with different type of levels of penetration, but that business is improving generally speaking and I would say, if you take the whole business group of the electronic and energy. You saw they had growth and they have margin expansion of 200 basis points year-on-year. So it's we are coming around and addressing a lot of issues in that business and I'm personally very encouraged and I think that management team guys doing a super job for us addressing some of issues we've had in the past. So I think, it's good we are addressing it and they're taking care of their own destiny and I'm very pleased to see that happening.\nJeff Sprague: Right and just a quick one for David then also. You've initially guided your tax rate, assuming the R&D tax extenders and everything came through, it looks like they won't but you've found a way to maintain the tax rate guidance. What is going on there, is it some of the restructuring Europe maybe just a comfort level also on that tax guidance at this point?\nDavid Meline: Yes, so if you look at the guidance we maintained the 28% to 29% for the year and that does continue to presume that we see a renewal sometime before year end of the R&D tax credit, which is worth about 40 basis points to us. So both of those we continue to foresee and then we saw some, first quarter was a little bit better than the overall full year, which was related to, we completed some prior year audits and we ended up releasing some reserves that we'd established, so that's the answer to the question.\nJeff Sprague: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe: Just again cleanups I guess, so David you mentioned roughly half of the price increases is a function of the currency weakness particularly in Latin America. So one thing about the, 110 bips benefit from price roll seeing your margin build and 50 bips from FX pinch. Is it that a phase, the impact currency net-net is neutral to margins?\nInge Thulin: No actually. And then we try to call it out, we had a net impact of FX in the quarter of 50 basis points in that.\nDavid Meline: Nigel, if you look on the income statement Slide with the margin block, you'll see it right on there.\nNigel Coe: Right, but then 110 bips from price, in some ways a function of currency and then you got pricing.\nInge Thulin: Sorry, Nigel. So the 110 is both price and raw's. Right?\nDavid Meline: Yes.\nInge Thulin: So raw material cost for us were down around 2% year-over-year, so that contributed to the 110 and then as you correctly pointed out, as I said the portion of price that remains of that 110. It's more or less 50/50 this quarter. So there is certainly some offset, to be honest I don't have top of mind, is it precisely a full offset. I think it's a little less than that.\nNigel Coe: No, that's really helpful and then the second part of my question was, you talked about raw materials were down 2%. You've got to say, opposite side different mix of raw material input and most of the things as we look at so, do you expect [indiscernible] generally speaking how that raw material in nexus tracking, particularly as we go into second quarter? And as we set on track for the roughly $0.10 of benefits from roadmaps this year?\nDavid Meline: Yes, so that's right. So starting out. We have guided $0.05 to $0.15 of raw material cost benefit for the year versus last year. Certainly in the first quarter, we were encouraged by the performance in that area and that's a combination of not only the trends on raw materials cost themselves, but also to the extent that are efforts to identify alternative formulations to lower our raw material cost and change the composition to the extent that. We have efforts that would actually lower the amount of raw materials in a products. These types of things are included in that performance and the good news, as our sourcing organization continues to do a really job in that area. So we feel good about the guidance on raw materials for the year. If anything, if I were to pick it the trend. It appears to be trending towards the high end of that range for the year.\nNigel Coe: Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the look forward into the second quarter. Maybe some commentary on how April has played out so far and David, are there any dynamics we should know about specially following up on Jeff's question on tax, a bit of a benefit this year with those releases. Anything unique about the tax or corporate expense for the second quarter?\nDavid Meline: Okay, in terms of, first one was what again? So in terms of the trends on volume in revenue. If you look, if you look at the first quarter first of all, typically March is our strongest month in that quarter, which turned out to be the case for us again this year and maybe a little bit stronger, slightly stronger than typical intra-quarter pattern. If we look at second quarter, we feel good about the overall view that will continue to operate. We said 3% to 6% for the year, which is a mid-point of 4.5%, which is exactly where we operated if you look at the second half of last year, we ran at 4.5% first quarter. We now ran at 4.5% and we feel good about second quarter continuing at that rate. Pluses and minuses, we've kind of inferred that we some level of optimism about the US. They're also areas of uncertainty and certainly places like Japan which is a very significant business for 3M. We did see a pull forward, it was quite clear pull forward of sales into the first quarter result of the tax increase. So I would say pluses and minuses. April started out fine so, we feel good about stable performance for the company. In terms of taxes, we had little over 27% rate in the first quarter, which was closing out some prior year audits and included in that there was a particular case, that we benefited from where, we were able to treat as deductible assets, some assets that had been previously disallowed. So that was a one-time occurrence for us in the first quarter which given that rate in the first quarter solidifies the view that for the year, we can operate at 28% to 29% and I don't see any unusual patterns that we would foresee quarter-by-quarter through the balance of the year.\nDeane Dray: Great, that's helpful. Thank you.\nDavid Meline: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie: Two quick questions; first on pricing. The currency fluctuations is notwithstanding, it still seems like you're getting 50 to 60 basis points in price and David, if I'm correct with your raw mat guidance, you're now. Do you think it's probably going to be trending towards another 50 to 60 basis points in the raw mat benefit for the remainder of the year? So is there any reason to believe, that you're not going to get at least price cost benefit of 1 point for the remaining three quarters?\nDavid Meline: What we expect price cost for the balance of the year. What we have guided originally was on pricing that we thought, it will be very modest for the year. Obviously, with the stronger first quarter performance significantly supported by the fact that we were having to offset foreign exchange. We expect that pricing performance to decline through the year, but nonetheless be positive and then on the raw material side, as I have already indicated I'm expecting if we look at that $0.05 to $0.15 range we set out for the year. I'm expecting that right now as we see it will trend towards the high end of that range. I think from that, you can probably get to the specifics that you were just asking about.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay and just a follow-up on that a little bit. You [indiscernible] 60 basis points potentially extra currency this quarter. You're continuing to invest at a higher rate on R&D, so is there any reason to believe that pricing should step down for the rest of the year. On just not thinking that.\nDavid Meline: Yes, it's a good question. I mean we have a number of actions that are calendar year based and so what we do expect is that, we will see some decline through the year, which I why we had originally guided that. It would be modest price impact on the core base.\nJoe Ritchie: Just one question on the buyback, it looks like the gross buyback this quarter was around $1.7 billion. I think your guidance for the year was $3 billion to $5 billion. So perhaps, one if you can just comment on what the net buyback was for the quarter and then also what would get you to maybe flex the $3 billion to $5 billion higher in the coming quarters.\nDavid Meline: Sure. So first of all the next buyback in the first quarter was $1.4 billion against the $1.7 billion gross. If you paid attention of the trends over the last couple of years, what's happened is, we've substantially seen a reduction of the outstanding on exercised option. So that's cut about an half over the last several years. So that will cause our net to be much closer to gross than it has been in the past. So that's one of the reasons, why we see it much closer this quarter. Secondly, in terms of the overall gross for the year. Basically the way I think about this is, if we go back to the fact that what we said we would do now, is we would move our capital structure to be better optimized going forward. And so we are starting to allocate the capital to put that in place and that started last year as we drew on cash. This year, we've said we would increase our leverage by $2 billion to $4 billion and if you look in the first quarter with the actions that we took, our leverage went up by about $1 billion against the $2 billion to $4 billion guidance for the year. So it's right in line what we'd indicated we would be doing and we also did modify the outlook for the year on the gross buyback to $4 billion to $5 billion from $3 billion to $5 billion based on, the fact when we add up all the pluses and minuses. We concluded that would be the right level for us here in 2014.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, great. Thank you.\nDavid Meline: Sure.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of John Roberts of UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Roberts: Since you're open to looking at multibillion dollar acquisitions. I don't think you've ever done a hostile, but we've had this due development of using activists to facilitate big acquisitions, is that something that would be too aggressive for someone like 3M to consider?\nInge Thulin: First of all, thank you for the question. I don't think that's the way you should move forward and when you look upon those type of things. We will like to do, strategically important acquisitions that would add value for everyone involved including 3M and our shareholders and the customers that was part of that. So I think that should be done in very careful way as we move ahead.\nDavid Meline: Yes, if I could add. Our experience \u2013 a couple of comments there; one is we did indicate at year end that as we looked at on our own capital deployment and looked at our capability both in terms of our performance on businesses we've been acquiring in recent years as well as the integration capability that we put in place to ensure that we will continue to have good performance going forward and given the size of the company and how we are deploying capital, our conclusion was it would be appropriate for us to no limit the scope of acquisitions to say $1 billion or less, which is been the history of the company. So hence, we indicate that we would be open to doing things larger than a $1 billion because likewise we don't like to surprise people, as we take action. So that's one piece of our thinking. In terms of the subject of hostile versus non-hostile. What I would tell you is that, one of the advantages we have as a company is typically. When we do approach companies with the possibility of acquiring, the reaction is typically very good because 3M is known be the kind of company that invests to build businesses and therefore, we found that generally speaking the reaction is good and that's our preference to take that type of approach frankly, if you think about the culture and a company that makes sense to us. We are about building businesses here and that's we would continue to plan to do.\nJohn Roberts: As I look across the portfolio. It seemed to me, the electronic and energy area might be the one that could benefit most from a major acquisition. Maybe the scale might help with the margin improvement, you're trying to achieve there and valuations, I would suspect a more reasonable and that's based into lot of the other competitors that have had struggles in that area over the past couple years as well.\nInge Thulin: Well, I think all five business group can benefit from actions in this area and it's an ongoing portfolio management activities that we are working on. So I will not call out, one business group over another one relative to, how we can build strings on strings in those business groups because when you look upon our strength in each of the five business group, it is very strong. So I think in each and individual business group that will add value by us working on the portfolio management as we are doing at the time.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I'll now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.\nDavid Meline: I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. Thanks for listening. Thanks for your attention to 3M. Have a great day. Good bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the 3M Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, January 26, 2016. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nMatthew Ginter - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2015 business review. Let me kick off today with a reminder of our upcoming 2016 investor events. On Tuesday, March 29, we will be hosting an Investor Day at our headquarters in St. Paul, including a welcome reception the evening before at our new R&D laboratory. Registration for the event will be sent out later this week. Also, our upcoming quarterly earnings calls are scheduled for April 26, July 26 and October 25. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. As a reminder, today's earnings release and slide presentation are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide two. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Now please turn to slide three, and I will hand off to Inge.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will open my remarks with an overview of our fourth quarter, and later in the call, I will give you a recap of our full year performance. 3M finished 2015 with another quarter of disciplined execution in a challenging external environment. Across our enterprise we controlled the controllable while investing in our business and returning cash to our shareholders. With respect to our earnings per share, we posted GAAP EPS of $1.66, down 8% year-over-year. As you recall, in October we announced our corporate restructuring which was completed in the fourth quarter. This action resulted in a Q4 pre-tax charge of $114 million and will deliver savings of $130 million in 2016. Excluding this Q4 charge, we posted earnings per share of $1.80. Company-wide organic local currency sales declined 1.1%. Consistent with our expectations at our December outlook meeting, organic growth was down low single digits in our two industrial-related businesses, namely Industrial and Safety and Graphics. Also, as expected, Electronics and Energy decreased in the high single digits as the consumer electronics market softened. On the positive side, our two consumer-driven businesses posted strong organic growth in the quarter. Consumer was up nearly 3% organically while Health Care increased almost 5%, its highest growth of the year. Acquisitions added 1.5 percentage points to our sales while the stronger U.S. dollar reduced sales by nearly 6%. In total, Q4 sales were $7.3 billion. Looking at margins, we delivered another good broad-based performance in the quarter. When you exclude restructuring, margins were up 60 basis points to a healthy 22%, with four of our five business groups posting margins greater than 21%. In the fourth quarter we posted strong free cash flow, with a robust 182% conversion. We also continued to invest in our business while returning nearly $2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Overall we had a solid finish to the year. And now I will turn the call over to Nick who will go through the details of the quarter. Nick?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by covering sales growth on slide four. Organic local currency sales declined 1.1% in the fourth quarter with volumes down 2.3%, partially offset by selling prices which were up 1.2%. Acquisitions net of divestitures added 1.5 percentage points to sales. This impact includes the acquisitions of Capital Safety and Polypore's Separations Media business and Ivera Medical. Along with the divestitures of Library Systems and our license plate converting business in France. Finally, foreign currency impacts reduced sales by 5.8 percentage points with notable year-on-year declines in the euro, yen and Brazilian real. As a result in U.S. dollar terms, fourth quarter worldwide sales declined 5.4% versus last year. In the United States, organic growth was down slightly as we experienced weak end market demand in our Industrial related businesses. At the same time, our consumer orientated businesses, Health Care and Consumer, continued to deliver positive organic growth. Organic growth in Asia-Pacific declined 2.7%. Three of our five business groups posted positive growth in the region, led by Health Care and Consumer while Electronics and Energy declined high single digits. Within Asia-Pacific, organic growth declined by 3% in both Japan and China/Hong Kong. Excluding our electronics businesses, Japan was up 3% organically while China/Hong Kong declined 3%. Moving to EMEA, organic growth increased 1.1% with Central East Europe up high single digits, West Europe up slightly, and Middle East Africa down mid-single-digits. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada declined 60 basis points. Brazil declined 6% while Mexico continued its trend of strong organic growth increasing 7%. Please turn to slide five for the fourth quarter P&L. Company-wide, fourth quarter sales were $7.3 billion, with operating income of $1.5 billion. GAAP operating margins in the quarter were 20.5%, down 1 percentage point year-on-year. Excluding restructuring, margins increased 60 point points to 22.1%, which reflects our ability to execute and effectively control those things within our control. On the right hand side of this slide you'll see the various components of our fourth quarter margin performance. Let me comment on the primary drivers impacting margins during the quarter. Lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 2 percentage points of margin expansion. Our global sourcing teams continue to capitalize on the impact of lower commodity prices and are generating additional savings above market. Foreign currency net of hedge gains decreased margins by 30 basis points. Fourth quarter strategic investments lowered margins by 40 basis points, primarily driven by portfolio management actions in our renewable energy business. Similar to past quarters, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced margins by 60 basis points. Finally, our fourth quarter pre-tax restructuring charge of $114 million reduced margins by 160 basis points. As Inge mentioned, these actions will result in a pre-tax savings of approximately $130 million in 2016. Let's now turn to slide six for a look at earnings per share. Fourth quarter GAAP earnings were $1.66 per share, down 8.3% year-on-year. Our restructuring decreased GAAP earnings by $0.14 per share. Excluding these costs, earnings were $1.80. As you see, a number of other factors also impacted our earnings. Growth and margin expansion added $0.03 to earnings in the quarter, which includes headwinds of $0.05 from pension expense and $0.04 from strategic investments. Excluding restructuring, our fourth quarter tax rate was 28.6% versus 28% in last year's fourth quarter. This reduced earnings by $0.01 per share. Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduced pre-tax earnings by $96 million or the equivalent of $0.11 per share. Acquisitions and divestitures increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined 4% year-over-year, which added $0.06 to fourth quarter EPS. Please turn to slide seven. We delivered strong free cash flow in the fourth quarter with a conversion rate of 182%. The primary driver was improved working capital. Free cash flow was $1.9 billion, up $199 million year-over-year. For the full year, we posted free cash flow conversion of 103%, similar to 2014. In 2015, we continued to manage towards a better optimized capital structure. We added leverage of approximately $4 billion which helped fund investments in organic growth, acquisitions and the return of cash to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we invested $446 million in CapEx, bringing our full year investment to just under $1.5 billion. For 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Also in the fourth quarter, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders via dividends and gross share repurchases. During 2015, we returned nearly $8 billion to shareholders including cash dividends of $2.6 billion and gross share repurchases of $5.2 billion. Now let's review our business group performance starting with Industrial on slide eight. Industrial posted quarterly sales of $2.5 billion. Organic growth was minus 1.8%, reflecting a slow industrial economy which impacted our business. In particular, our advanced materials business declined high single digits impacted by weak demand in the oil and gas end market. On a positive note, our automotive OEM business grew high single digits as we continued to gain share by increasing 3M's content per vehicle. This business has consistently grown faster than global car and light truck production levels. 3M purification also posted strong organic growth in the quarter. The acquisition of Polypore's Separations Media business, which enhances 3M's core filtration platform, added 1.7 percentage points to Industrial sales growth. Integration activities and financial performance are on track and meeting expectations. On a geographic basis, Industrial's organic growth was positive in EMEA, Latin America/Canada and Asia-Pacific while the U.S. declined mid-single digits. The Industrial business delivered operating income of $476 million in the quarter with operating margins of 19.3% or 21% excluding restructuring. In addition, the business is absorbing the Polypore's Separations Media acquisition which reduced margins by another 50 basis points. Please turn to slide nine. Fourth quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were down 2.5% organically to $1.3 billion. As a reminder, organic growth in this business was up over 9% in Q4 2014 which included a $30 million impact from Ebola-related demand for personal safety products. Excluding this impact, Q4 sales in our Safety and Graphics business was flat organically. Within Safety and Graphics our commercial solutions business had another solid quarter which capped off a strong full year of mid-single digit growth. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 4.6 percentage points to sales growth. As a reminder, in August we acquired Capital Safety, a leading provider of fall protection equipment. Integration is on track, and the business is meeting operating income targets. On a geographic basis, organic growth declined in all regions. Operating income was $282 million in the quarter, and operating margins increased 1 percentage point to 21.8%, or 22.7%, excluding restructuring. The net impact from acquisitions and divestitures added 150 basis points to Safety and Graphic's fourth quarter operating margins. Please turn to slide 10. Our Health Care business generated fourth quarter sales of $1.4 billion with organic growth of 4.5%. Organic growth was broad-based, led by double digit increases in both health information systems and food safety, with other oral care up mid-single-digits in the quarter. The Ivera Medical acquisition added 80 basis points to fourth quarter sales growth and continues to exceed performance objectives. Health Care grew organically in all geographic areas, led by Asia-Pacific. This business continues to drive penetration in developing markets with 8% organic growth in the quarter. China/Hong Kong was particularly strong with double digit organic growth. Operating income was $444 million, up nearly 3% versus last year's fourth quarter. Health Care's operating margins were 32.1%, up 110 basis points year-over-year, or up 180 basis points, excluding restructuring. We continue to be pleased with the strong and consistent performance of our Health Care business and will continue to invest in this business to drive greater success. Next let's cover Electronics and Energy on slide 11. Fourth quarter sales for this business group were $1.2 billion, down 7.7% organically. On the electronics side, organic sales declined 8%, impacted by weakness in the consumer electronics end market and excess channel inventory. We expect this softness to continue into the first quarter. Our energy-related businesses were down 6% organically as sales declined in renewable energy, telecom and electrical markets. On a geographic basis, organic growth was down across all areas. Operating income for Electronics and Energy was $200 million, with operating margins of 16.5% or 17.5%, excluding restructuring. In addition, portfolio management actions in our Renewable Energy business reduced Electronics and Energy margins by 2.4 percentage points. For the full year, operating margins were 21.1%, up from 19.9% in 2014. Our portfolio actions in this business group over the last three years continued to pay off in 2015. These actions are enabling us to deliver solid margins even in the face of challenging conditions in both Electronics and Energy end markets. I'll finish with our Consumer business on slide 12. Fourth quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion. Organic growth was solid 2.7% paced by our home improvement business. This business continues to win in the marketplace with leading brands, such as Filtrete filters and Command adhesives. Stationery and office supplies and home care were also up organically while organic sales declined in consumer health care. Fourth quarter holiday sales were strong, driven by solid demand for our category-leading Scotch and Command branded products. Looking at Consumer geographically, organic growth was broad-based across all areas, led by the U.S. Consumer's operating income was $254 million with operating margins of 23.1% or 23.4% excluding restructuring. That wraps up our review of the fourth quarter business results. Please turn to slide 13, and I'll turn it back over to Inge. Inge?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Nick. With another solid margin and cash flow performance, our fourth quarter capped off a year of disciplined execution and efficient growth from our global team. Even in a low growth environment, we expanded full year margins nearly a full percentage point to 23.3%, excluding restructuring. In 2015, for second year in a row we posted free cash flow conversion above 100%. We also delivered a strong return on invested capital of 22.5%, coming on top of a 22% return in 2014. Beyond these solid financial results, I view 2015 as a fundamentally important year in terms of 3M's future. This is because of the investments we made and the actions we took to position our company for long-term success. As you see, last year, we invested a total of $7 billion in research and development, acquisitions and CapEx. We also made significant progress on our three key levers which represent important value creators for our enterprise. The first is portfolio management, which is all about strengthening and focusing in our portfolio of businesses. We do this through both acquisitions and divestiture and also through business consolidation. Last year, we took actions on all fronts. In Health Care, as an example, we combined our dental and orthodontic businesses into one single oral care solution business. Consolidating businesses allow us to allocate resources to our best opportunities while creating greater customer relevance, scale, productivity, and improved speed. Since 2012, in fact, we have realigned from six sectors to five business groups and from 40 businesses to 26. To complement organic growth, we also made three strategic acquisitions in 2015. This includes Capital Safety and Polypore's Separations Media business which enhanced two of our core technology platforms, personal safety and filtration. At the same time, we divested three businesses that no longer fit within our portfolio. Investing in innovation is our second lever. Last year, we invested $1.8 billion in research and development. As you have heard me say many times, research and development is the heartbeat of our company. It enables us to both invent and manufacture cutting-edge, relevant and unique products for our customers. This in turn drives organic growth, which is our primary growth metric and also supports our premium margins and return on invested capital. Last year, in addition to investing in technology development, we took action to better connect our scientific capabilities to our customers around the world. We opened six new customer technical centers, including in West Europe, Middle East/Africa and Asia-Pacific. We also opened our new state-of-the-art research laboratory in the United States which we look forward to showing you at our Investor Day in March. Our third lever, business transformation, starts and ends with our customers. It's about transforming our business processes to make it easier and quicker for our customers to do business with us anywhere around the world. The backbone of business transformation is our new global ERP system. In 2015, we made good progress, most recently, with the successful roll-out in the Nordic countries. We also announced the creation of three global service centers which will optimize our delivery of transactional services and service a broader platform for operational effectiveness into the future. We expect business transformation to result in $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020 and another $0.5 billion reduction in working capital. That covers our three levels, and I'm very pleased with our progress in all of them. In addition to work we did on those levers, we made other investments to position 3M for success in both the short- and long-term. As we have talked about before, we run our company with one eye on the microscope and the other eye on the telescope. Or in other words, making sure we are positioned for success today and many years into the future. Let me give you two examples. First, on the telescope view, we made a significant investment related to our brand equity. Our 3M brand is strong, and last year we invested in a new brand platform, 3M Science. Applied to Life. To make it even stronger. This will enhance awareness of how 3M uses science to solve problems for our customers which go back to our vision of improving every company, every home and every life. Next on the microscope view, we completed a corporate restructuring focused on structural overhead and slower growing markets which will help us manage through the current economic realities. And we made all these investments last year while also return $8 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. When I look upon all we accomplished in 2015, it was a fundamentally important year for the future of our enterprise. As you can see, we are continuing to build an even stronger, more competitive company that will win in 2016 and beyond. And on slide 14, you will see our planning estimates for this year which are unchanged from December's outlook meeting. We estimate earnings per share in the range of $8.10 to $8.45, an increase of 7% to 11% year-over-year. Organic growth is expected to be 1% to 3%, with acquisitions adding 1% to sales. Finally, we expect our free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%. With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: One moment while we compile the Q&A roster. And our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning, Scott.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nScott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: It looks like you were pretty aggressive in restructuring in 4Q. Can you give us a sense of the payback, what kind of tailwind in 2016, and what impact on guidance I suppose? And then just how much of that restructuring do you think you have to continue to do in 2016, just given the relatively weak macro out there?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Scott, the restructuring that we announced in October, throughout the fourth quarter we executed that almost exactly as we laid out then. We're for the fourth quarter $114 million pre-tax charge. And from that we're expecting $130 million operating income benefit in 2016. We expect that benefit to be pretty evenly loaded across the four quarters of 2016. And in regards to need for others, based on the outlook we have for the business and for the rest of 2016, we never say never but we don't \u2013 we're not anticipating anything at this time.\nScott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's really helpful.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: And, Scott, this is Inge.\nScott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We just came off kickoff for the year under the theme of efficient growth. And I think it's important for us to say, that as Nick said, you never know what you need to take for action, but my view is now with a range 1% to 3% on the top line, even in the lower range of that we should be able to prepare our self for when the market turnaround and stat to grow again. So I would like to have an efficient model where we can deliver now but also be prepared as we see things start to turn around, hopefully later in the year, but for sure you'll go into the future a couple of years. So you're right. You never know if it's becoming tough or what you need to do. But I think with the action we took now, at least I feel that we are prepared to deliver what we are telling you. And also, equally important, be ready to go offensive as soon as we see it's coming.\nScott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, makes sense, Inge. Is part of the go offensive potential related to M&A? I mean, you still have plenty of balance sheet space. And I would assume, given what's going on in the public markets, that private market evaluations are coming down a bit. Would you entertain getting more aggressive with M&A in 2016 if we're in a soft spot that gets tougher?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, the primary strategy for us is organic local currency growth. But I think we are willing and open to do things like we did in 2015. We did a couple of good acquisitions in 2015 in order to build out our platforms both from a technology perspective, but also be more relevant in the market. So the answer to that is that the pipeline is good for our businesses and again it's coming back to the evaluation of the asset as we look upon them.\nScott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's helpful. Okay. Good luck, guys. Thanks. I'll pass it on.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning, Steve.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Steve.\nSteven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Could you talk about the destocking impact within that negative 2.3%? What are you seeing in the channels and sell in, sell out and how much of a factor was that this quarter?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: When we look upon the inventory, you can say that consumer-related businesses like Health Care and Consumer, they're on a level that is very good, right. And you see the growth there. I will say that if you look upon industrial-related businesses, there's maybe a couple of weeks, but not more than two, of excess inventory in the channels as we see it. And if you go to consumer electronics, it's a little bit higher. And we estimate that maybe to be like maybe closer to three weeks of excess inventory at this point in time in the channels. So let's say two plus in industrial-related business and Electronics and Energy, or consumer electronic. And we don't see any issues at all in the Health Care and Consumer businesses.\nSteven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So that means unless things get worse you'd expect that to be fully flushed out in the quarter we're in right now, Q1 or...?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think we have to be on careful on the industrial sized businesses and consumer electronic. I don't know if it will be flushed out this coming quarter, but it should be if end market come back a little bit. I would say you should think about it in the second quarter.\nSteven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: When we look upon growth rate, and I think Nick said that in consumer electronic and our business EEBG, we say that growth rate Q1 be very similar to Q4. Maybe slightly worse, but I will say similar. And for the company, we will compensate that through our Consumer and Health Care businesses and a little bit more uptick in Industrial.\nSteven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And on page five, the productivity and other contribution of 0%, I know that's ex restructuring down in the bottom. But maybe just talk through again. I think I missed or not sure why that's only zero.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, Steve, that's a function partially of a lower growth environment that we're offsetting inflation that we're seeing there. But it's not enhancing our margin. It's tougher in a lower negative growth environment to be eking out productivity, plus we used our levers of restructuring and which we called out separately with the 1.6% impact on the margin. So we executed strongly to adjust the cost structure. But in the end, outside of the restructuring, it had zero impact on our total margin for the quarter.\nSteven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Right. Well, all the incremental or decremental leverage on the organic volume was 0.2% below that, right?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Right.\nSteven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So this was just purely, you're just saying you offset the wage inflation and is that usually around a couple percent or is it much lower right now?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Total wage inflation is more in the 2% to 3% range.\nSteven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, wanted to follow up on Scott's question regarding has any of the year-opening market volatility changed your plan to add incremental debt or any changes in your buyback strategy for 2016?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Deane, our strategy that we announced in December for incremental leverage and for gross share repurchases of \u2013 we announced that to be in the $4 billion to $6 billion range. Those remain unchanged for us. That's our plan, we think it continues to be the good and right plan for us for 2016.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. And, Nick, maybe just walk through the \u2013 I know seasonally you have strong fourth quarter cash conversion. This seems even above that. Was that any working capital improvements? And then any comments on the hedging program, how has it played out? And with regard to expectations against this volatility?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: First, Deane, on the free cash flow conversion, you know there's seasonality. The first quarter of any year is typically our lowest free cash flow conversion, and the fourth quarter of the year is typically our highest free cash flow conversion. We saw that play out in 2015, and we'd expect that to play out in 2016. In particular what you're seeing in the fourth quarter, there's a couple things. One is working capital. We did a good job managing working capital throughout the fourth quarter. And in addition, the restructuring expenses of $114 million pre-tax, much of that did not yet result in a cash outflow. That cash outflow will come in the first half of 2016. So we're seeing a little bit of movement between 2015 and 2016 there. As far as hedging, Deane, we continue to manage our hedging strategy as I've described in the past that over the next 12 months we attempt to hedge approximately 50% of our economic exposure, and then in certain developed currencies we layer on additional hedges on a diminishing scale out into the second and third year. That's playing out as we planned. For the total 2015, we had a hedging benefit of $182 million, and if foreign exchange rates stay where they are today, that $182 million will become approximately $160 million for total 2016.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: It's $160 million to the good?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: $160 million hedge gain.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. Thank you very much.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Deane.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thank you. So price cost is another good margin tailwind in Q4. I just wondered how you were thinking right now about the overall $0.10 to $0.15 raw materials boost in the EPS bridge you gave six weeks ago? And when you gave that guidance, how much of that $0.10 to $0.15 was assumed to come in the first half of this year relative the second half?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, Julian. We \u2013 yeah, the 200 basis points this quarter, I'll just make a little comment on that before I go on to the 2016. Of that 200 basis points, 110 basis points of that is coming from raw material commodity price benefits and another 90 basis points from increases in our selling prices. When we gave the guidance in December of $0.10 to $0.15 for raw material, we were basing that on the oil price assumption of $45 to $55 a barrel. We all know where oil is today, right around $30. A rough ballpark for us is a $10 movement in oil. It helps us for an entire year by $0.02 to $0.03. So our thinking right now is we're right about at the high end of that $0.10 to $0.15. And at the time we guided this, in December, we saw virtually all of that benefit coming in the first half of 2016. We still see it heavily weighted to the first half of 2016, but we can see some of that benefit if oil stays in this range coming into the second half as well.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Very helpful. Thank you. And then my second question would just be around Electronics and Energy where you talked about portfolio management actions in renewables reducing the margin by 240 points. Maybe just give \u2013 maybe I missed it in your prepared remarks, but could you give some more color around what's happening there?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, as you have seen, we have taken action for quite some time now in order to prepare that business really for the future. And, I think we have been successful for that relative to margin expansion and also growth rates. And as I said on the other calls, what I feel very good about is that that model now will deliver very solid margins, even in a tough economical environment with slower growth. And we have proven that's something very good about that. This quarter we took actually a write-off on an asset we had that didn't make sense any longer for us. And we asked \u2013 because we had a quarter here where we could do it, and the strategic important of that asset for us, it was not there any longer. And I'm very, very keen to prepare that business for an even stronger future. So it was based on an asset that we took a write off of.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. And lastly very quickly, organic sales in Q1 overall, 3M firm wide, should we assume it's about the same or a little bit worse than the minus 1% in Q4?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I would say that as we said earlier, I will assume be equal to Q4. And then we will see how it play out in between the different businesses, right. For me, it looked like \u2013 and for us it looked like Health Care and Consumer will continue with an accelerated growth. We are very pleased with that because that's again showing the strengths for us in our diverse portfolio. And also when you look upon the margins that is good, right. That's very, very good margins in Health Care and as you have seen in Consumer really improve the margins the last couple of years as well. I would say that Electronics and Energy is probably a business and consumer electronics specifically that then will be similar to this quarter. Maybe slightly down in that segment specifically. But I will say, think about it as \u2013 3M as an enterprise very similar to Q4 and Q1 of this year.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nShannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning, guys\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Shannon.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning, Shannon.\nShannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. In the Health Care business, drug delivery was up this quarter. I mean that's I think been a drag for a while. Is that now turned around? And what's your view on that piece of the business for 2016.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: That business is very much project-based so it would go a little bit up and down but we will see slightly better growth rate in 2016 versus 2015. And, again, you \u2013 as you recall, this quarter you mentioned this quarter showed slight growth versus where have been in last three quarters in a tougher situation. So again based on what we see in the pipeline we are more positive on that piece of the business for 2016 versus what we were able to deliver in 2015. So your observation is correct. And I will say your assumption moving forward, we hope that you're correct on that as well.\nShannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks. Then just on Europe, I mean, it's something I think last year, you were kind of expecting to improve through the year, maybe came a little lower than you thought originally. What's your updated view on what you're seeing there and your expectations for Europe anything getting incrementally more encouraging or less encouraging?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Europe for long time have been a challenge relative to growth rate in the market, right? And we have taken action very much on the efficiency part and the productivity part. And as you saw when you added it together now there was a growth of Europe, Middle East, Africa but the three pieces is that Middle East/Africa down, Central Europe up 8% and slight up in West Europe. So West Europe, we have slight growth and I think that would be very dependent on how Germany can come off in 2016. And we have also to think about it that Central East Europe, that growth rate was very much price that came out from our action we took in Russia. So Central East Europe, Middle East/Africa take that portion of it, generally speaking it's a challenging environment geopolitically that we then have to be careful of. And West Europe you see some spots of growth but I think very important thing there is that Germany, the machine of Germany has started to deliver a little bit more growth. And we maybe can see a little bit more there. I think we are well prepared in that part of the world due to work that we have done for the last, I would say maybe the last five years of streamlined organization taking out structure, bigger span of control and lower levels in organization, et cetera, in terms of management. Still, kept focus on our execution around commercialization as we have so many different languages as you know over there. So you need be very nimble and fast in execution in each country and then that will reduce management structures as much as you can.\nShannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thanks.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Jeff.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Good morning. I was wondering if you could come back to price. And, Inge, you mentioned that \u2013 what percent of your price is kind of actions that are countering FX kind of like you mentioned in Russia I'm sure versus like-for-like price? And maybe speak to the ability to get like-to-like price in this environment?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Jeff, I can speak on this both for the quarter and the year. It's a similar story. About 75% of our total reported price growth is in direct or indirect response to FX movements, primarily in developing markets. So if you look at our 120 basis points, about three quarters of that directly a result of FX movement. Our core ability to impact price excluding FX has ranged in the 30 basis points to 50 basis points. And we continue to see that range going forward for the company, that into 2016. The delta on top of that is \u2013 will be dependent on what happens with FX movements. But 30 basis point to 50 basis point of core, and then whatever on top of that, that may happen if FX rates move even more than what we laid out in December.\nJeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Great. And we should assume that the write off you took is equivalent to that 2.4 points of margin pressure in E&E? Is that correct?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yep, Jeff. That's exactly correct.\nJeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. And then just finally, could you just speak to the actual kind of direct/indirect oil and gas exposures that you do have in Industrial and S&S (48:44)? And how you see that playing into the early part of the year especially?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Okay. So, Jeff, to be clear you said in Industrial and Safety and Graphics?\nJeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Yeah, I'm thinking within safety kind of fall prevention and protection gear and things like that? And then obviously in Industrial you've got some.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, some of our direct exposure is what we're selling through the personal safety line. And what I'll say to that is as 2015 progressed, we probably didn't see a lot of impact in the first quarter, and then that grew for us in 2015 in the second through fourth quarter. We continued \u2013 we expect that to continue into the first quarter of 2016. And there will still be some negative impact after that from oil and gas, but we think the worst of the comps will be behind us from oil and gas after the first quarter and then diminishing the rest of the year. Probably a similar comment for the Industrial portion. We have some of our advanced materials that are impacted by \u2013 that go into the oil and gas industry. And then we also have some exposure in our Electronics and Energy business, and the comps for that we think for the first quarter for sure, and possibly in the second quarter we'll still be seeing some challenge there. Jeff.\nMatthew Ginter - Vice President-Investor Relations: Jeff, to put a number on it at a total company level, if you took the businesses directly linked to oil and gas, it would be about 3% of our sales. Just as with the economy, any knock-on effects of a slower oil and gas market clearly are impacting the economy, but the direct exposure to oil and gas would be about 3% for us.\nJeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Great. Thank you for that color. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Hi.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Nigel.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I just wanted to go back to Nick's comments on price, 30 bps of core price plus whatever the FX movements are. But obviously you don't have price baked into your 2016 bridge specifically. But I'm assuming that's part of your organics? I'm just wondering, do you have what, right now, 50 bps of price within your organic bridge?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Nigel, in our guidance the way we said it we expect 1% to 3% organic the vast majority of that volume. So 30 basis points to 50 basis points of price in that 1% to 3% total organic growth.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then I wanted to clarify the impact of acquisitions and disposals on Safety and Graphics. Obviously a strong margin performance there. But is the benefit from disposals because the Library Systems business was so much lower margin? Or is there a small gain there? Or is it both of those factors?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Nigel, we divested of two businesses in Safety and Graphics in the fourth quarter, our library systems as well as a license plate converting business in France. The net impact of those two resulted in a small gain, accretive to our earnings per share of approximately $0.015 cents. The rest of the total impact of M&A on Safety and Graphics is our acquisition of Capital Safety doing a little better than what we had been projecting.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you very much.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, good morning.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Steve.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Just looking at the bridge on slide six, I think, for basically just trying kind of to understand the seasonality and kind of sequencing. Using those buckets, probably not a ton of change in tax and foreign exchange, those are probably pretty straightforward. What is the M&A contribution for first quarter year-over-year that you guys expect? I know there was some noise in numbers, obviously, with charges and stuff. But what is the M&A contribution in the first quarter year-over-year?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Steve, for the total year we guided approximately $0.10 benefit. Our view is that that will be quite evenly distributed over the four quarters. So for the first quarter, roughly one-quarter of that $0.10 benefit. And that's inclusive of the impact of the most recent portfolio action that we announced a few days ago with the small business in our Industrial business. So...\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Got it. Makes sense. So I guess when I kind of add all these items up, and I'm not really asking for a precise guidance here, but you guys are calling for a 7% to 12% EPS growth over the course of the year. Is that, is every quarter kind of within that range? Or with the little bit lighter organic, is that enough to get you below the low end of that range for the first quarter year-over-year?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Steve...\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're trying to get us to give quarterly guidance, right?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, I...\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Well, I think it's good to calibrate this stuff with the sequencing of what's happening in the year organically.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Steve, we've talked about the organic growth that we're expecting in the first quarter. That is a quarter that I would expect will be more challenged also from an earnings per share growth. Everything else being equal, there's not one outlier that will compensate for the, what we've already said about the organic growth in the first quarter.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right. Okay. That's kind of what I was getting at. Great. And then one last question just on the balance sheet. I know in prior years you guys have kind of toggled up the repurchase in some instances. I mean, are you, given that you're at the end of your most recent kind of five-year plan, should we think about buybacks as pretty much set? Or could you kind of toggle that up like you've done in past years from your standing 2016 guide at some point? What's the appetite there?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, our appetite is pretty well-reflected by the $4 billion to $6 billion guidance that we stated. I will reiterate, our approach is there's a certain amount where we're in the market every day of buying. And then there's a portion that we are flexing up and down, depending on the relative value we see of 3M stock. And we continue to follow that playbook in how we repurchase our shares in 2016.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks a lot.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning, guys.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Hi, Andrew.\nAndrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey. Just a question on Electronics and Energy. How much visibility forward do you have on this whole smartphone situation because it's one of the concerns we've been hearing from investors, that being a disproportionate hit on your business?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We have \u2013 as you know, we work on those platforms daily with our customers. So I think that when we have laid out our plan for the year, we have good understanding relative to when new introductions will come and our position on them. And we have a good position, as you know. We got to hit now, of course, not because of that we were spec-ed out or lost anything, just because the market was down. And this is estimated to be down in Q1 as well, as you have seen in media. And I think we will see an uptick coming in the second half of the year. Hopefully we have orders coming in, I would say, in terms of in end of second quarter is when we will start to see orders coming in to us for launch later in the year.\nAndrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And can you help to frame the risk from technological disruption? Also been getting questions on transition to OLEDs and how that impacts the business, because I think people remember what happened a decade ago with flat screen TVs and try to draw a parallel here?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, well we are aware of competition in terms of technologies to LCD such as OLED, which is the one you refer to. And we have known that for a long time. That's also one of the reasons why we realigned our organization to form our display materials and system business in early 2014. And there's an integration of those businesses into what I would call display technologies, which is a goal for the future for us to expand into. And we have already products that is going into equipment that are using OLEDs. So we are not behind in any way. We have on every, I would say, every equipment today that are using OLED, we have multiple applications in them. And there's more to come in that area. But we have been working on this area for quite some time. And that's part of our model. That's why I would say the strengths of 3M through our technology platforms, this is exactly where it is, right. So I see more opportunities as you go ahead over the longer term as we are working with our customers on it.\nAndrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey. Good morning, guys.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning, Andy.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Obviously some good margin performance in Industrial and Safety and Graphics despite lower organic growth. So as you go through the year, how much ability do you have to keep margins up even with the headwinds that you see? I know you had guided to about 150 basis points of margin improvement for the company for 3M in 2016 when you had your guidance call. Is that still what you expect within the guidance?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, Andy, that 150 basis points, that's still a good ballpark. There's a lot of things that are going into that, including our estimate of 1% to 3% organic growth. Some productivity coming from things such as our business transformation investment, our pension expense as well as some strategic investments. All-in, we're seeing many of those things play out exactly as we guided in December. The 150 basis points is still a good number.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. And your consumer businesses were strong in the quarter. Maybe they slowed a little bit versus last quarter and year-over-year growth. So just the resiliency of the consumer right now, it seems like the consumer is still pretty strong, but your view?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, it is very strong. And I think there is a couple of things that is important to think about relative to 3M and our position in the market. We are very strong in United States in our consumer business. So we have a stronger and better penetration in United States than we have outside of United States. If you look upon United States specifically, and you look upon data and facts, which is a key indicator for us relative to potential growth rates, we all know that there is a challenge on IPI as we go into 2016. And the fact there is saying that it's slower Q1, Q2, maybe Q3, and then Q4 it will pick up again on IPI year-over-year. If you look upon retail sales index, it's actually different. It's very robust as we go in already to Q1 and Q2 and for the rest of the year. So I would say that our business there is in a good position. And we feel very good about it. We have very good brands. We add a lot of value into the channels, and we are managing a lot of categories in that business. The same goes for Health Care. Health Care is the same. Health Care for us, and I'm not talking U.S. versus outside of U.S. there. I am talking about developed economies versus developing economies. And 80% of our portfolio in Health Care is in developed economies, meaning developing is still a huge opportunity for us. And we are growing very well there. And our margins are very high. So I think that's coming back to in times like this, where you see some challenges in some economies around the world, if that's in Industrial or Electronics or even in safety. We have the advantage that we have domestic-driven businesses in Consumer and Health Care that this carries on. And you saw that this quarter again, Health Care had almost 5% organic local currency, the strongest for the year and with margin expansion. It's just a fantastic business for us and the same go for consumer. So we feel very, very good about them. And it's sustainable. I think that's the important thing that it is a sustainable business model for us based on world class product solutions.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Joe.\nJoseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So two quick questions. Maybe focused on your Industrial business for a second. Inge, you've had some distributors recently talking about improving short cycle trends in January and there's been some green shoots that we're seeing as well out of the semi sector. Just wondering is there anything across your Industrial business today where you're starting to feel better about things incrementally or is it still \u2013 the trends are still very similar to what we've been feeling for the last six months?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No. I would say that there are certain pieces in our business that are doing very well. And I can \u2013 3M purification is doing extremely well. Had a growth rate in the quarter of 10%. And for the full year 8%. Automotive OEM is doing very well for us. Had a growth in the quarter of 7% and in fact for the whole year is around 7%. And then I think that some \u2013 where the pressure is just now is I would say general manufacturing. And then that go broad based, right? But I will not say short term. As we're talking here in the next quarter or the next five months, I don't see that we will see a big pick up. I think it would be very similar in Q1 versus Q4. But some businesses doing very well; automotive OEM and purification doing extremely well. But we have also to think about it in terms of growth on a global base. So United States, there was pressure this quarter down 6. But we were growing in many other cases around the world. And I think that's important to think about in terms of us as a global growth company. So we had organic growth in India, China. We grew 6% in China. If you think about that, it's a big market, second biggest subsidiary for 3M outside of United States and the second biggest economy in the world. Still for us our Industrial business in the quarter, 6% growth; we had 3% growth in Japan and United States was an issue. So I think we have to balance it out in terms of how we look upon the future here. And we have decided and we are a global growth company. So I will say that as you go into the year, we will see \u2013 we should see, we should see an uptick coming into the second half of 2016 for Industrial.\nJoseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's a really helpful color, Inge, and maybe my follow-on for Nick. Now that the restructuring is done at least the cost actions have been taken in 4Q, any additional color you can give us on the cadence of the restructuring? I know it needs \u2013 it's going to be the restructuring benefits. I know it's supposed to be second half weighted but any additional color would be great.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, Joe, the benefits in fact will not be second half weighted. From a comp standpoint, yes, but the fact that charge out came in the fourth quarter of 2015. But the actual benefits going forward will be quite evenly weighted across the fourth quarters of 2016.\nJoseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Oh great. That's great color. Nice job executing in this tough environment, guys.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: And our final question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLaurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Good morning. Two quick ones. Just wanted to flag \u2013 in auto OEM are you seeing any soft spots around the world? And secondly as you look at your share gains, do you see those as sustainable? Or is that a pro-cyclical phenomena that is as end markets improve your pace of share gains slows down?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No. They are sustainable. If you think about it, you're going to look upon the facts we have now for three to four years outgrown the automotive production on a global base. So our growth is always more robust than the total output of cars produced. That is indicating that we penetrate and take more application per car. That is sustainable by definition, due to the fact that we provide solutions that is helping automotive industries with technology conversion. So don't view us as a commodity player that is coming in, he has to try to replace someone. For us, it's about technology conversion moving you to the next level on your specific retail in order for you to be able to compete in the marketplace. So that is sustainable by definition, and that's what 3M is all about. I will not say today that I see any differentiation where someone is becoming much, much stronger geographically, some other weaker geographically in terms of production of cars. That is where we play, right. We design-in, spec-in always at the headquarters of companies, if that's in Germany, Japan or United States. And then where the car is produced, that is where we have the teams to put the application in place, a type of development and deployment. And I don't feel there's any differentiation there on a geographical base. But our model is sustainable.\nLaurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Thank you.\nMatthew Ginter - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Lawrence.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for closing comments.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. To wrap up, 2015 was an important year for 3M as we made investments and took actions to propel ourselves for the future. As a result, we are well positioned to drive efficient growth and create greater value for our shareholders in 2016 and beyond. I thank you for joining us, and we look forward to seeing you all here in St. Paul in March. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the 3M third quarter earnings conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, October 22, 2015. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nMatthew Ginter - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2015 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments today, and then we'll take your questions. Today's earnings release and slide presentation are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com. Please turn to slide two for a list of upcoming 3M investor events. On Tuesday, December 15, we will discuss our 2016 business outlook on a conference call beginning at 8 AM Central time. Please note we will not be hosting this year's outlook meeting in New York, as has been our practice in recent years. The conference call should last approximately 90 minutes, so please plan accordingly. Also, on March 29 of next year, we will be hosting an Investor Day at our headquarters in St. Paul. Lastly, note the dates for next year's earnings calls, which are scheduled for January 26, April 26, July 26, and October 25. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide three. During today's conference call we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to slide four, and I will hand it off to Inge.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. And as always, thank you for joining us. 3M delivered solid operational performance in the third quarter. In an external environment that had remained soft, our team posted strong earnings, organic growth in all geographic areas, and expanded margins. Equally important, we continue to make investments and take actions to build strengths on strengths and position 3M for long-term success. Let me first take you through the quarterly numbers. Earnings per share rose to $2.05, which is a 3.5% increase year over year. Companywide, we delivered organic local currency sales growth of 1%, with positive growth across all geographic areas. Four of our five business groups grew organically, paced by Consumer at 5% and Health Care at 4%. Acquisitions added one percentage to sales in the quarter, as we deployed capital to drive growth and strengthen the business. The strong U.S. dollar continued to impact our top line, reducing quarterly sales by more than 7%. Total sales in the quarter declined 5% to $7.7 billion. At the same time, we continued to generate strong productivity in the quarter by controlling those things within our control. As a result, operating margins were 24.3%, up nearly a full percentage point year on year. All five business groups delivered margins greater than 22%. In the quarter, 3M also returned $2.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now please turn to slide number five. At 3M, we always have one eye on the microscope and one eye on the telescope. The microscope view is about driving growth, productivity, and efficiency day to day, quarter to quarter, and year to year. The telescope view is about the long term and making sure we are investing in the future. The global economy continues to evolve, as do the needs for us and for our customers. 3M is evolving as well, building for a future that will be more competitive, more dynamic, and more challenging. We're doing that in large part through our three strategic levers, portfolio management, investing in innovation, and business transformation. Let me start by describing our efforts to strengthen and focus our portfolio and ongoing processes, an ongoing process we began in 2012. In the third quarter we closed two important acquisitions to both complement organic growth and enhance two of 3M's core platforms, Personal Safety and Filtration. The integration of those businesses is off to a good start. At the same time, earlier this month we announced the divestitures of our Library System business and our French license plate converting business, both within our Safety & Graphics business group. After extensive review, we concluded that these businesses were worth more to an outside owner versus remaining part of the 3M portfolio. Selling the businesses resulted in greatest value creating for the company and for the shareholders. Last month we also announced that we are exploring strategic alternatives for the Health Information Systems business, which is an Industrial leader in healthcare coding software. Options include spinning off, selling, or keeping the business. Ultimately, we will choose the best path to benefit 3M, our stakeholders, and the business itself. The selection of a strategic direction is anticipated by the end of Q1 in 2016. In addition to portfolio investments in the quarter, we continued to invest in organic growth through research and development, in close partnership with our customers and the market. Technology conversion will remain a key driver for the global economy into the future, and our investments will strengthen 3M's scientific edge. And at our Investor Day in St. Paul next March, we look forward to taking you through our new state-of-the-art research laboratory. Finally, to make 3M more competitive, more productive, and more efficient, we are transforming our business processes. The backbone is a new global ERP system. As you recall, we are implementing this system on a regional basis, starting in Europe. 3M made good progress in the third quarter, including a successful deployment across the Nordic countries. Our team is focused on continuing to execute a rollup plan in West Europe, with the United States to follow. By 2020, our business transformation efforts will result in an estimated operational savings of $500 million to $700 million annually and a reduction in working capital of $0.5 billion. Beyond our three strategic levers, we are taking other steps to increase our competitiveness and strengthen 3M for the future. Today we announced a restructuring plan that will result in a reduction of 1,500 positions. The reduction will be preliminarily focused on structural overhead, launched in the United States along with slower growing markets, with particular emphasis on Europe, Middle East-Africa, and Latin America. On a pre-tax basis, we will take a charge of approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter related to this plan, with savings of approximately $130 million in 2016. Each and every day as I look across our enterprise, I grow more confident in our future. We are taking action to build a stronger, more agile, and more focused company that will compete and win not just today but well into the future. Thank you, and now Nick will go through more details on the quarter. Nick?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide six, where I will cover the elements of third quarter sales growth. Q3 organic growth was 1.2%, largely driven by higher selling prices. Volumes were up slightly in the quarter. All geographic areas posted positive organic growth in the quarter. In August we completed the acquisitions of Capital Safety and Polypore's Separations Media business. The net impact from acquisitions and divestitures added one percentage point to sales growth in Q3. Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 7.4 percentage points, with notable year-on-year declines in the euro, yen, and Brazilian real. These currencies devalued versus the U.S. dollar by 15%, 14%, and 37% respectively. In dollar terms, worldwide sales declined 5.2% versus the third quarter of 2014. The United States delivered organic growth of 1.5%, led by Consumer, Health Care, and Safety & Graphics. Our U.S. Industrial business, which experienced softer end market conditions and a challenging year-on-year comparison, declined organically. Asia-Pacific organic sales increased 0.4% in the quarter, where four of our five business groups posted positive growth. Organic growth was led by Health Care and Safety & Graphics, while Electronics & Energy declined year on year. Within Asia-Pacific, Japan increased 1% organically or 5% excluding Electronics. As you may recall, last fall we acquired the remaining 25% interest in our Sumitomo Japan subsidiary. The 3M Japan team continues to execute well and is delivering strong results in 2015. China-Hong Kong's organic growth was down 2% or up 3% excluding Electronics. Moving to EMEA, we saw organic growth of 1.5%, with West Europe flat, Central-East Europe up double digits, and Middle East-Africa down slightly. Finally, Latin America-Canada delivered organic growth of 2.3% versus last year's third quarter. Mexico continued its trend of strong double-digit organic growth, increasing 13%, while Brazil declined 2%. Please turn to slide seven for the third quarter P&L highlights. Companywide, third quarter sales were $7.7 billion, with operating income of $1.9 billion. Operating margins were 24.3%, an increase of 90 basis points year on year. As you see on the right-hand side of the slide, the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 170 basis points of margin expansion. Productivity added another 20 basis points to margins, as we continue to prioritize investments, benefit from past portfolio actions, and drive operational efficiencies through Lean Six Sigma. Foreign currency impacts net of hedge gains increased margins by 20 basis points. The impact from recent acquisitions reduced Q3 operating margins by 60 basis points, as we began to absorb purchase accounting adjustments and work through integration plans for Capital Safety and Polypore's Separations Media business. Strategic investments reduced margins by 10 basis points. Finally, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced third quarter operating margins by 50 basis points. Through nine months we have increased total company operating margins by one percentage point to 23.7%. Let's now turn to slide eight for a closer look at earnings per share. Third quarter earnings were $2.05 per share, an increase of 3.5% year on year. The combination of organic growth and margin expansion contributed $0.11 to our earnings growth this quarter. These results include a negative $0.04 impact from higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense. Our third quarter tax rate was 29.6% versus 30.3% in last year's comparable quarter, which increased earnings by $0.02 per share. And average diluted shares outstanding declined by 4% year over year, which added $0.08 to third quarter earnings per share. The acquisitions of Polypore's Separations Media business and Capital Safety reduced earnings by $0.04 per share in the quarter due to purchase accounting adjustments and one-time expenses and integration costs. In the fourth quarter, we expect $0.02 per share of additional dilution from these transactions. Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduced pre-tax earnings by approximately $95 million, or the equivalent of $0.10 per share. For the full year, we expect foreign currency impacts to reduce earnings by approximately $0.40 per share. Let's now review cash flow performance on slide nine. We generated $1.7 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, down slightly from last year. Third quarter capital expenditures were $354 million, in line year on year. For the full year, capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion versus a prior expectation of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow and converted 101% of net income to cash. Free cash flow conversion for 2015 is now expected to be in the range of 95% to 100% versus 90% to 100% previously. As a reminder, our fourth quarter free cash flow conversion is typically the strongest of the year. We returned $2.2 billion of cash to shareholders in the third quarter, an increase of $369 million year on year. Cash dividends were $635 million, and gross share repurchases were $1.5 billion. For the full year, gross repurchases are now forecasted to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion versus a prior expectation of $4 billion to $5 billion. Now let's review our business group performance, starting on slide 10. Industrial posted sales of $2.6 billion in the quarter, up slightly organically. Our Automotive OEM business grew mid-single digits, as we continue to gain share by increasing 3M's content per vehicle. This business consistently grows faster than the rate of global car and light truck production levels. 3M Purification, Abrasives, and Industrial Adhesives & Tapes also posted positive organic growth in the quarter. Our Advanced Materials business declined, primarily due to weakness in the oil and gas market. The acquisition of Polypore's Separations Media business added 70 basis points to Industrial sales growth in the third quarter. On a geographic basis, Industrial's growth was positive in Latin America-Canada, Asia-Pacific, and EMEA, while declining in the U.S. The Industrial business delivered operating income of $580 million in the quarter. And operating margins were 22.5%, up 30 basis points year over year, or up 90 basis points excluding the Polypore Separations Media acquisition. Let's now turn to Safety & Graphics on slide 11. Sales in Safety & Graphics increased 2.9% organically to $1.4 billion. Organic sales growth was strong across much of the portfolio, including Commercial Solutions and our Heartland Personal Safety business. The Roofing Granules business posted double-digit organic growth in Q3, while Traffic Safety and Security Systems declined year on year. Complementing Safety & Graphics organic growth was the acquisition of Capital Safety, which add 4.2% to sales in the third quarter. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by Asia-Pacific, EMEA, and the U.S., while Latin America-Canada declined. Operating income was $324 million, and operating margins declined 0.6 percentage points to 22.9%. Excluding the Capital Safety acquisition, margins rose 1.3 percentage points to 24.8%. Please turn to slide 12. The Health Care business generated third quarter sales of $1.3 billion, with organic growth of 3.7%. Our Medical Consumables businesses, namely Infection Prevention and Critical & Chronic Care along with our Oral Care business, were up mid-single digits year on year. Together these businesses represent three-quarters of our Health Care business. Health Information Systems and Food Safety enjoyed double-digit growth in Q3. Drug Delivery declined organically, as its challenging year-on-year comparisons continued into the third quarter. The Ivera Medical acquisition added 90 basis points to quarterly growth. Integration of this business is going well, and it is exceeding sales and profit objectives. Our Health Care business grew organically in all geographic areas, led by Latin America-Canada, Asia-Pacific, and the U.S. The business continues to drive penetration in developing markets, with 10% organic growth in the quarter. Countries with notable strength included Taiwan, China-Hong Kong, India, and Mexico, all up double digits. Health Care's operating income was $432 million with margins of 32.1%, up 110 basis points year over year. Next, let's cover the third quarter performance of Electronics & Energy. Please turn to slide 13. Sales for this business were $1.4 billion in the quarter, down 2.8% organically, while operating income increased slightly to $342 million. Portfolio management actions, raw material benefits, and the team's relentless focus on operational excellence drove a 240 basis point improvement in operating margins to 24.9%. Organic sales declined 3% on the Electronics side of the business, with Electronics Materials Solutions up slightly and Display Materials and systems declining. In our Energy-related businesses, organic sales were down 2%, similar to past quarters, with growth in telecom more than offset by declines in electrical markets and renewable energy. On a geographic basis, organic growth increased in EMEA, while the U.S., Latin America-Canada, and Asia-Pacific all declined. Please turn to slide 14. Third quarter sales in Consumer were $1.2 billion, with organic growth of 5%. Organic growth was led by our Stationery & Office Supplies business, with strong back-to-school sales in Scotch home and office tapes, Post-it, and Command products. In the home improvement business, our Filtrete brand filters, which significantly improve air quality in the home, also helped propel growth in the quarter. Our Home Care business also delivered positive organic growth while Consumer Health Care declined slightly. Looking at the Consumer business geographically, organic growth was led by the U.S., Asia-Pacific, and EMEA, while Latin America-Canada declined. Operating income increased to $293 million, and margins were 25.2%, up two percentage points year over year. That wraps up our review of the third quarter business results. Please turn to slide 15, where Inge will provide an update on our 2015 planning estimates. Inge?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Nick. As we all know, the current economic growth environment remains challenging. Against that backdrop, today we are updating our full-year outlook for 2015. We now expect organic growth of 1.5% to 2% versus prior guidance of 2.5% to 4%. Foreign currency translation will reduce sales by approximately 7% compared with a prior range of 6% to 7%. Excluding the impact of restructuring, we expect full-year earnings per share in the range of $7.73 to $7.78. We previously expected EPS in the range of $7.73 to $7.93. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS in the range of $7.60 to $7.65, which reflects the expected $0.13 restructuring charge in Q4. We also now anticipate a free cash flow conversion rate of 95% to 100%, up from the prior range of 90% to 100%. So thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: And our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, Inge and Nick.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning, Scott.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nScott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I think a lot of us are trying figure out what \u2013 more macro I guess than 3M specific, but this is the second quarter in a row where you've taken down your top line core guidance. I'm trying to get a sense of how much of the decline you guys think might be related to inventory destock versus actual sell-through, and maybe just the state of where you think inventories are right now because clearly folks are a little bit more cautious. So you can see it would be logical that folks would be decreasing inventories right now, I suppose, right?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think it's a combination, Scott. I think first of all when you look upon the decline in terms of IPI [Industrial Production Index] growth, we have all seen that going down quarter by quarter during the year. And that is related both to United States and to China and Germany, you can say basically on a global base. I think that is one impact. And then, of course, enterprises around the world look upon the balance sheet and the cash flow and type of work down there, the inventory as well. So I will say when we look upon our performance in terms of growth, yes, it slowed during the year, but we don't believe and we know that we are not losing out in terms of penetration or market share. But I think it's a combination of both of them. So we clearly see \u2013 we're ending out the year I will say at the lower global growth rate in the economy versus what all of us anticipated as we went into the year. And when I look upon that, I feel personally very good of how we as a team, and I'm talking now about all the 90,000 at 3M, have been able to manage that through and improve most of the metrics when it became more of a challenge for us to grow. But we are growing. We are growing and we have margin expansion and very good cash flow. But also your question, I think it's combination of both. And I think people would like to look out a couple of years now, what will this mean? And I think everything you see that we have been doing this year in terms of our portfolio work and our investment in R&D and the business transformation in addition to the announcement today of the restructuring is for us to be prepared as we move ahead in order for us to give good return despite maybe something that would be difficult for us to control, which is the growth in IPI and GDP. So I hope that helps.\nScott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: It does, so help us understand. How do you plan for this type of an emerging market slowdown that we've seen? Really the last time we had a major EM dislocation was in the 1990s. It was a long time ago. And it's impossible to hedge the local currencies. It's tough to raise prices when you have \u2013 when you're trying to raise prices in an economy and a recession. And then at the same time, some of these countries like Brazil are hard to restructure. It's not easy to fire people there either. How do you plan for it, and how do you change? Do you just keep moving forward like you always have, or do you start to think in terms of taking real fixed assets out and disinvesting in some of these areas?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You just not continue as you have done in the past, of course, because the landscape has changed and then you have to, as I always say, if you go out in a forest and you go out with your map, and the map in the forest doesn't connect any longer, the forest is always right. So you cannot continue with your map if you think about that as a business plan. So we are doing that. When I look back over the years here, it's not something that we react to just today based on a quarter that is softer in one way or another. If you go back to China, for instance, we have not added people there for 12 to 18 months. We didn't reduce by definition, but we adjusted and slowed down the way we added people. Brazil today, you are correct. Brazil today will still, in my view and I think in most of our views, be a challenge maybe for the next two years. And you can see also in the restructuring announcement today, we're talking about Latin America as primary focus. And inside of that is, of course, Brazil. So what you have to do is to surgically go in and address it. And I think that's serving us well with a model we have is very much around localization, meaning we have a managing director in each country that is leading the operation, and there is an empowerment around that. But they get a lot of help from us. I can tell you that, Scott, in order to make sure that we take action. But we're just careful in terms of building out assets in terms of manufacturing and so forth that you maybe did differently five years, six years ago and just see how you can serve those markets differently. Now, you heard as Nick said, if you take our Health Care business that is growing very well and is very profitable, they had 10% organic local currency growth in developing economies in the quarter, consumers doing well, et cetera. So when I look upon it, yes, there is a shift in between developed and developing, and we adjust accordingly. But there's still a big penetration opportunities in those countries. But you're more cautious. You are looking upon it slightly different and make sure you position yourself for the long term.\nScott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Completely understandable. Thank you, guys, I'll pass it on.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Scott. I hope you're doing well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Morning, Andrew.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Hey, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just instead of asking a question on margins, I just want to zero in on Electronics & Energy. If we go back to 2013, the margins bottomed out at 15%, and you reported a margin almost 25%. Could you just focus on that business and explain to us what is it you were able to do there, and how does it translate into changes that are taking place at 3M at large?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Andrew, good morning. Yes, you're right. I think it started out like 15.7% or something, and now it's an incredible improvement relative to margins. What had happened is, first of all, we realigned the businesses, as you maybe recall. We did that in late 2012. And one of the reasons for that was we reduced the number of business groups. So we tried to build out relevance for our customers. We reduced the number of divisions, meaning tried to get out more efficiency, more productivity, and get more alignment with the market and the customer. So we were able to respond faster with technology platforms. If you take this specific business, Electronics & Energy [EEBG], we went from eight or nine divisions to four divisions. We relentlessly looked upon the structure of it and we reallocated assets in a better way that we had for that specific business that they have to utilize maybe in between three different business groups. Now we add it together so they could manage it, which helped them to drive efficiency in the manufacturing, be able to respond much faster to customer demands, and also they address a lot of, I would say, issues in the portfolio. So you remember, we had this analysis where we had Heartland division strategic \u2013 or push forward and then under strategic review. They addressed all of that. And as I've said earlier and I think this is now showing again, I said it last two quarters that the margin for that business is now at the point that it's not dependent on big growth on top line only to drive margins. So we have now proven that for the third quarter that the model is now streamlined, efficient, with very good combination of manufacturing, commercialization, and R&D capabilities in a very streamlined organization. And I will say; you said \u2013 you referred to the rest of 3M. It's the same everywhere, but this business group could get a bigger lift because where they started. One business that you see had a very good result this quarter is Consumer. Consumer 2012 also started with eight divisions, and now four divisions. We worked to streamline the organization. We took out unnecessary layers in the organization. We have addressed span of control and levels in the organization, and that is happening everywhere in 3M. You see bigger benefit from some short term because they had a lower starting point, but EEBG had the lowest. And if you're running 15.7% operating margin and are part of 3M, that is not us. And I will compliment that business group for taking that on and work it through, and today we see the result. It's nice to see.\nAndrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And a follow-up question on China. Do you think you will see any benefit from RMB devaluation offsetting just weaker macro there? It's an export business, as I understand.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Andrew, we're watching for that. And the change \u2013 the movement in the renminbi has been fairly modest. We're not seeing a movement on that. And if it is we expect it to be minor, although we do see it as a positive development for that portion of the business, but minor at this point.\nAndrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Andrew.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, good morning.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Morning, Nigel.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just wanted to pick up on the inventory question. You called out inventory headwinds in 2Q. Clearly, it's impacting 3Q as well. Do you have any sense on how deep we are into this correction and whether we might get into a situation where sell-through is somewhat equal to sell-in?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: It depends on which business group or which market you are in. But I will say that my own observation when I look upon it for the last three to five years generally speaking there's a much better correlation in between sell-in and sell-out for most companies and most markets; and I will say, if you think about retail and consumer, much, much better. So you can see a slight change from ending of a quarter to a new quarter based on maybe the season and so forth. But I would say it's generally speaking very well balanced today, which is also then giving us an opportunity to be more efficient in fact relative to our manufacturing and production and so forth. But to give a timing on it is difficult. I cannot do that, Nigel, to be honest with you. It's very difficult to do. But I think overall, management of inventory is handled much, much more effectively generally speaking, which is good for all of us.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, that's very fair. And then just to home in on 4Q, it looks like you're forecasting your 1% midpoint core growth for 4Q very similar to what you did in 3Q. I'm just wondering, though, given the developments through the quarter, in particular the latest step down in the EM currencies, have you seen any change in behavior in places like Brazil or Southeast Asia, maybe even Canada or Australia, on the back of these movements? And maybe in particular, just home in on pricing power because you successfully continue to pass through a lot of currency weakness in price. I'm wondering. Has there been any change in behavior over the past few months?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Nigel, in the last few months, what we've seen in FX movements more recently has been more focused on developing market currencies, whereas early in the year it was more in developed market currencies.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: And what you're seeing \u2013 how you're seeing that manifest is developing market currencies is where 3M has a little more pricing power, ability to raise price to offset that FX movement, and that's why we're seeing the 110 basis points of price growth in the third quarter. About 75% of that 110 basis points we attribute to FX movements. So we've seen some shift though very subtle in that as the year has gone on.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: But no change in your ability to pass on that weakness in price?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes, it's been \u2013 that part, parsing it out between developed and developing has remained remarkably stable.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks and good morning, guys.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning, Steven.\nSteven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, I just want to follow up Nigel's question quickly on the pricing point. You mentioned, Nick, that 75% was FX-related. So as you look at unit volumes versus non-currency-related pricing going into the fourth quarter, are you therefore implying a pickup on unit volumes at this point?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Our range for the year of 1.5% to 2% does not anticipate a very significant movement in price growth in the fourth quarter from where we've been running in the first nine months of the year. I think we're expecting it to be very close to where we have been running so far this year.\nSteven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, including unit volumes.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: And then unit volumes will, depending on the implied range for fourth quarter that 1.5% to 2% says for the year, unit volumes could range to slightly negative to slightly positive in the fourth quarter.\nSteven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then on the restructuring and ERP pacing, so one of my questions here is you've called out that ERP, the savings from ERP over time, I think you mentioned again in this call $500 million to $700 million annually, was it? And the restructuring, you've got another $130 million in 2016. First of all, is that incremental to the ERP, the track record, is the trending for ERP pacing? I assume there's an enablement. Are they completely separate? Is one enabled by the other? And is there any financial overlap between the two?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: There is some overlap between the two that the progress we're making with business transformation and the actions we're taking have enabled some of the restructuring actions that we announced this morning. We still see ourselves on that path from the $500 million to $700 million. This restructuring announcement enables us to accelerate the path to that $500 million to $700 million a little faster. That's a portion of that $130 million of savings. It's by no means the dominant portion of that savings we're talking about.\nSteven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And given the short payback period there, it just makes me think that there's still a lot of opportunity within 3M for additional restructuring. Is that an unfair comment?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I don't know if it's an unfair comment. We are living in a competitive world, and we adjust as we go. When you look upon this, we are addressing here areas where we believe we will get very good return on the investment we are doing here in Q4, and it's very targeted. It's very, very targeted relative to where those opportunities lay. If you think about what we have done here over the last three years, three and a half years, we have addressed many things in terms of combining divisions and reduced the number of business groups, et cetera. And now the efficiency is now at the point where we can take the next swing at it. But I will say that when you look upon an organization like ours, we have to make sure that we really have the commercialization capabilities in place; that we have continued focus on research and development. And also I will say around Lean Six Sigma, making sure in times like this that we maybe even add more to Lean Six Sigma. What you have to ask yourself is structure, management layers, and so forth, which is necessary in some times, but then you come into other times where you just prepare yourself for the future. So the answer to your question is it's very difficult to say if you need to something more. You play it by ear and see how the competitive landscape looks like, and you adjust to that. Our commitment is to grow our business and have a good return back to our shareholders.\nSteven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks for the color.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Deane.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Hi, Deane.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: I'd like to come back to a question I had asked when you first made the Polypore announcement, and so we tabled the question till it closed. And I'd be interested in hearing the ways you're envisioning leveraging this ultra-filtration technology across 3M. It reminds me a bit of Ceradyne and the way all the different product areas that would benefit from ceramic technology. So how do you expect to leverage Polypore? I know it's in Industrial, but I would imagine there are some interesting applications on the Health Care side.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, you are correct. It's housed now, if you like, in the Industrial business group with very close linkage to our Purification business because maybe from a commercialization perspective see the fastest opportunity for us to leverage both of those businesses. When you look upon the technology and where it can move out, I will say it's maybe in life sciences. We don't call it life sciences, but it's a combination of Health Care and biotech where there are big opportunities for us. And we do business in the biotech area, not necessarily with our Health Care business group, but very much with the Purification business, and there are big opportunities for us that we can build out. But at this point in time, the total focus is short term to integrate the business, make sure we get full leverage based on what we have paid, and can give back to the shareholders based on what we paid for that business. But you're right. I think you have more opportunities in businesses going versus Health Care, life sciences, biotech, than you have for instance in Consumer and Safety & Graphics. But we take it seriously now in terms of integrating the business and execute the plan as a first step. So we don't migrate the resources in R&D and start to \u2013 they need to present very specific programs and opportunities in order to get the resources to expand the business as we move ahead. So more to come, Deane, we are now focused to integrate them and integrate the model and execute.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And then second question, I was hoping you could share with us some of the decision-making and the timing on the move of Health Care IT into strategic review. So what prompted it? What changed? And then so we have the vernacular correctly within how you frame your businesses, I would assume this had been in Heartland, not push-forward. And so what bumped it into strategic review and when?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: First of all, it was in push-forward. It was not in Heartland. It was in push-forward. And I think the important thing that was for sure not in the first category under strategic review. It is a business that is doing very well. I think it's our responsibility to look upon all businesses to say can we get better benefit in a different business model. Is there more value that can be created in a different way for some of our businesses? This business could be one of them where we would like to evaluate. And as you know, it could be a spin, it could be a sell, or we keep it. We are making that evaluation now, and we will know because I wouldn't like to move forward and ahead of our own process. And at the end of Q1, we should know how the outcome of that will be. If you go back and look upon \u2013 in my view at least, today we have a very good process in order to mesh our businesses and try to understand where we can leverage even more. And in some cases we have to ask the question. Can we lever more and can there be more return to shareholders in a different business model? I think that's my responsibility to do and I think it's our team's responsibility to do, and then we do it. So it's not always a business that is under-performing that you need to evaluate. Sometimes in a case like this, you have to look upon it. And it had been on my mind for some time, I would say, but I'm very careful to not overload the initiatives relative to the portfolio. My first objective was to make sure that we got all businesses to a respectable position. And I think we are there now, as you have seen as a result, in EEBG as well. And then there's a time for everything, and now we are here. We have announced it. We are transparent about it. And then we have to see at the end of Q1 what the next step will be. Any case, it's a fantastic business. If it's with us, if it's a spin, or it's sold, it's just fantastic. So there's nothing wrong with this business. And it takes courage to take a step like this in a business doing as well as this is doing.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Jeff.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Can we just come back to restructuring? Inge, as you had pointed out, you've done a lot of internal blocking and tackling in this consolidation of these segment divisions underneath the segments. How would you size what you're announcing here in the fourth quarter relative to the normal ongoing restructuring that 3M must do every day?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: This is, of course, bigger. So if you're talking about where you normally type of challenge every step on the way, that's what you're talking about.\nJeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Yes.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So those so-called adjustments, I would say that's more an adjustment of the organization that you do. And you ask yourself the question every time you get an opening, do we need to replace it and so forth. This is more sizable at this point in time. And why now is very much that I feel now that we have a very good handle on our model in terms of operations. So it's like when you go through everything as you describe it, you have pieces that are moving the whole time in your portfolio, et cetera. Then you're coming to more of a sterilization. Now you look upon it to say okay, is there more that can be done and should we do it now? So it's 1,500 people. It's sizable, in my view, for each individual person that is impacted by it, so I'm very sensitive to the whole situation. But it's something that we need to do in order to build strengths on strengths. So people can view it as saying 1,500, is it a lot or is it not enough? For us it's perfect at this point in time. And I don't underestimate that because I understand the impact for each individual of those 1,500 that need to go away and do something different.\nJeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: And as you've restructured these other segments though, then just ostensibly there's excess overhead and facilities. Those have just attrited down through this process, or would we expect that at some future date not too distant in the future there could be other moves like this?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think, as I said earlier, in my view and our view is as we move ahead here, we have an opportunity in our supply chain area. And that will be maybe something we will talk about as we move ahead. But that's different in a way. That's about the whole model of us improving our balance sheet, our turns and reduced inventory and so forth. And if you do that as you go down the line, you cannot think about that there are less distribution centers maybe fewer manufacturing sites, et cetera. So the beauty with all that, despite we are doing very well, there are still opportunities in 3M in order to create value.\nJeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Great. And then just one really quick one. Was there any change in the monthly trends in your business, Inge? We've heard from some that July and August was okay, and then September was much more challenging. Did you see anything like that across your business?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Jeff, this is Nick. No, no, we didn't. As we look at the three months, they were all very similar.\nJeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thank you.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, good morning. Thanks for fitting me in.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Hi, Steve.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: The Electronics margins were pretty strong despite the continued revenue pressure there. What's going on there in Electronics? And I guess where do you go from this higher base?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Steve, Inge talked a little bit about this earlier about the margins going on there. A number of things of some of the consolidations that have occurred, the push on productivity and relevance with our customers, and building a business there that is not dependent on growth as a way to generate a margin in this range. That going forward, this is still a business that we see opportunities for growth in the future. So we continue to invest in this business. And as far as margins going further, I'm not ready to make a statement like that yet. But we continue to see this business growing and with margins that are at or slightly higher than the total company margins.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: So I guess just stepping back to the macro a bit, I guess from your commentary, I just want to make sure that I'm reading what you're saying the right way. You're basically saying that there's not a lot of inventory dynamics going on here. So I guess as we look at the second half of the year with volume flat, is there any real impetus for a pickup as you move into next year? Or is this kind of the \u2013 look, this is the environment we're in, that's why you guys are taking restructuring? You're holding the line on price a little bit better than expected. I just want to make sure I parse out the macro comments and understand where your head is at on the degree of potential acceleration or good news that could come moving beyond the fourth quarter.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Steve, as we look forward, we remain constructive on our view of the global economy for 2016, albeit we're expecting a similar slow growth environment to what we're seeing in 2015. You're talking, when you talk about, ask about impetus of other things changing, as we look at 2016 for us, in addition to that slower growth organic world, we are expecting raw material benefits to continue into 2016, but at a lower level than what we've seen in 2015. This restructuring that we discussed this morning, that will be accretive to our views for 2016. Pension, OPEB, right now we see that as a benefit to us in 2016 of approximately $100 million. And of course, we'll continue to drive productivity in our company as well as getting benefits from our capital allocation strategy that we have been following and will continue to follow. Headwinds that I see right now going forward into 2016, FX has been a headwind throughout 2015. We see it being a headwind for us in 2016, just not on the same level. We see it at a lower level than what we've seen in 2015. And then just to round it out, as I look at 2016 I also see interest expense. As we're following our capital structure, capital allocation strategy, we see interest expense going up in 2016.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: So I guess does this year, I guess next year, can you still get to that longer-term model that you guys have talked about, that close to double digit, even with current volume levels?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, Steve. We're still in the stages of putting together our entire 2016 plan. We'll share more details on that on our December 15 conference call.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right. I had to try, thanks.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Steve, always a pleasure.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, thank you.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Nick, hi. Just following up on the comments around capital allocation and what that means for interest expense and so on, just more broadly I guess when you're thinking about the buyback target for the medium term that you'd laid out a few years ago, maybe talk about what's the scope for that to move up and how you view the credit rating in the context of the propensity to increase capital allocation.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, thanks for the question, Julian. We're continuing to follow our capital allocation and capital structure strategy that we've laid out. We do see that we're continuing to make progress on that capital allocation strategy. You saw in 2015 us deploying $3.5 billion into mergers and acquisitions. Our plan does call for us leveraging our balance sheet to grow the business, investing first in the business but maintaining some flexibility for opportunistic deployment. And we're continuing on the path we've laid out, Julian. In regards to your question about debt rating, as we've indicated in the past, we would consider a downgrade for the right value-creating strategic opportunity. Those include acquisitions as well as times when we see 3M as a good value to buy ourselves.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks, and then just a very quick follow-up on emerging market demand. Obviously, a lot of people have expected that to tail off for 3M in recent months. It didn't happen in Q3. Just to confirm, as you entered this quarter, how were the emerging market organic trends in aggregate? Were they fairly similar to a few months ago?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I think so, maybe even \u2013 yes, if you take in totality, yes. China shifted a little bit positive for us actually in this quarter, not much, but a little bit. So you go minus 3% to plus 3%. So you're not overly happy with core business China up 3%, but it's much better than minus 3%. So I would say I think we went sideways with almost 2% growth in what I call developing economies. My view there is you adjust your organization as you speak, but I still specifically in domestic businesses, which for us is Health Care and Consumer, huge penetration opportunities. And then for the rest, it would be very much based on the global economy and export businesses, et cetera. But I would say in between Q2 and Q3, we went sideways with some small growth. As you know, Brazil is a tough time. We're minus 2% in Brazil, but that was slightly better than in Q2 anyhow. So it's a tougher situation, but it's absolutely not hopeless. And we have penetration opportunities that we try to go after them.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great, thank you.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nLaurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Good morning, just one quick one. With the productivity related to the ERP and supply chain improvements, do you see the benefits flowing through in a fairly even cadence from here, or will there be extra costs in 2016 and 2017 that will dilute the impact initially and then make it stronger later in the decade?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Laurence, two parts to the question that I'll go through here. First of all, from the cost standpoint of our investment in business transformation, we're at a point where we're at the peak of what we're investing in this, and any incremental investments would be small or non-existent of what we're spending on that initiative. In the coming years, we expect to see ourselves growing to build to that $500 million to $700 million of operating income benefit that we've shared. I'm quite confident as we talk on December 15 about our outlook for 2016, you'll start to see some of those benefits being shared at that time and how they'll impact 2016, starting small, but then growing as we progress to 2020.\nLaurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for some closing comments.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. To wrap up, we continued to deliver solid operational performance in 2015, and I thank our whole 3M team for an outstanding effort. This quarter, we expanded margins and posted strong earnings while taking many actions to strengthen our long-term competitiveness. We're executing our plan and controlling what we can control and building for the future. Thank you again for joining us this morning, and have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the 3M second-quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, July 23, 2015. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nMatt Ginter: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2015 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments and then we will take your questions. As a reminder, please mark your calendars for upcoming earnings call dates, October 22 and January 26. Also take note of our next investor meeting scheduled for December 15. More details will be available as we get closer to that date. Today's earnings release and the slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our investor relations website at 3M.com. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide two. During today's conference call we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to slide three and I will hand off to Inge.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Overall this was a good quarter for 3M, marked by broad-based organic growth and margin expansion. We continue to operate in an uncertain global economic environment which softened growth. At the same time, we grew organically in all geographic areas, expanded margins a full percentage point and increased net income. Most importantly, we maintained our commitment to managing 3M for the long term with strong investments in our portfolio. Let's go through a few of the second quarter's numbers. Earning per share rose to $2.02, a 5.8% increase year-over-year. Our team posted local currency sales growth of 2% company-wide. On an ex-electronic basis growth was 2.2%, the same as Q1, and I will talk more about our electronics business shortly. Organic growth was positive in all geographic areas paced by the United States at 4%. Four of our five business groups grew organically, led by safety and graphics at 5%, followed by consumer and healthcare businesses at 3%. Growth in industrial slowed a bit to 1% as we experienced channel inventory adjustments in general in the industrial markets. Electronics and energy declined 3% organically in the quarter. This business group faced a tough year-on-year comparison and we also saw somewhat softer consumer demand in the electronics markets. However, even in softer market condition we increased margins in electronics and energy to more than 21% for the second straight quarter. As you recall, last year we consolidated a number of businesses within electronics and energy to better align to customers and generate efficiencies, and that portfolio work is paying off. I am pleased with the progress of this business and going forward, the team is focused on driving spec-in wins, increasing productivity and advancing our technology's capabilities. In the second quarter we saw continued strength of the US dollar, which reduced company-wide sales by 7.3%. As a result, total sales declined 5.5% to $7.7 billion. We increased 3M's operating margins to 23.9%, up 1.1 percentage points. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year margin expansion company-wide. Our margins remain strong and broad-based as all business groups posted margins greater than 21%. This is a testament to the strength of our portfolio and business model, and our business teams around the world driving productivity each and every day. In the second quarter we also continued to actively deploy capital in order to improve the business and return cash to shareholders. We returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And just last month we announced the acquisition of Capital Safety. Capital Safety is a leading global provider of fall protection equipment and will bolster 3M's personal safety business, which is a strategic priority in our portfolio. This acquisition builds upon a number of other portfolio actions we have taken to strengthen our portfolio. Please turn to slide number four. Portfolio management is one of our three strategic levers and is vital to our success. To succeed in the long term we must constantly evolve to meet the changing demand of our customers and the global economy. Back in 2012 we began a comprehensive review of 3M's portfolio and started to make changes to better align our portfolio to our long-term strategic objectives. This includes reallocation of resources to our best opportunities. It also means taking action to create greater value, such as combining businesses within our company to increase customer relevance, scale and productivity, acquiring businesses that align with 3M's fundamental strength and strategic objectives, and divesting businesses that no longer align with those strengths or objectives. In the first half of 2015 we took action on all fronts. Earlier this month, for example, we combined two of our healthcare businesses. Our dental and orthodontic business, which are both recognized for their strong technology and brands, were merged to form a single Oral Care Solutions business. Now, through a seamless and single partnership, we can offer customers an entire suite of oral care innovations, thus increasing our relevance and generating efficiency. In fact, since 2012, we have consolidated businesses with each of our business groups. As a result, we have moved from six business groups to five and from 40 businesses to 26. Next, our acquisitions. Earlier I talked about last month's announcement of Capital Safety. In February, we also announced $1 billion acquisition of Polypore's separations media business, which will enhance 3M's core filtration platform. And in March we acquired Ivera Medical, a strategic addition to our healthcare business group. At the same time in January, we sold our static control business after thorough strategic review. Because of our team's work, 3M is now leaner, more focused and better positioned to win big opportunities and create greater value for customers and ultimately for our shareholders today, and even more so in the future. Thank you, and now I will turn the call over to Nick for more details on the quarter. Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on slide five were I will describe the elements of second quarter sales growth. We generated organic local currency growth of 1.8%, with volumes contributing 0.8% to our growth and selling prices adding 1%. The sales impact from acquisitions, net of divestitures, was neutral in the quarter. Positive growth related to the Ivera Medical acquisition was offset by our divestiture of the static control business. Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 7.3 percentage points in the second quarter. The most notable currencies impacting sales were the euro, yen and Brazilian real, which devalued versus the US dollar by 20%, 17%, and 28%, respectively. In dollar terms, worldwide sales declined 5.5% versus second quarter of 2014. On a geographic basis, the United States led the way with organic local currency growth of 4.1%. US growth was broad based, led by safety and graphics and consumer at 6%, healthcare at 4% and industrial at 3%. Latin America/Canada posted organic growth of 0.8% in the quarter. Growth was positive in our healthcare and industrial businesses, while safety and graphics and electronics and energy both declined organically. Mexico delivered another outstanding result with 17% organic growth in the quarter, and Brazil turned positive with 1% growth. The impact of year-on-year sales declines in Venezuela reduced organic growth in Latin America/Canada by 4 percentage points in the quarter. This headwind is behind us starting in Q3. Organic local currency growth in Asia Pacific was 0.5% in the quarter, with healthcare and safety and graphics each growing 9% and consumer growing 3%. Electronics and energy declined 4% organically in Asia Pacific. Organic growth was down 2% in China/Hong Kong in the second quarter. Healthcare delivered strong growth which was offset by declines in safety and graphics, electronics and energy, and consumer. We continue to see the Chinese economy adjusting to new growth levels and we saw channel adjustments in some key end markets, which impacted our growth. For the full year 2015, we now expect organic growth in China/Hong Kong to be in the mid single-digit range versus mid-to-high single-digits previously. Japan delivered another good quarter with second quarter organic growth of 2%, or up 7% excluding electronics. Health care and safety and graphics posted strong organic growth followed by steady growth in our consumer and industrial businesses. Turning to EMEA, organic growth was 0.4% in Q2, with West Europe declining 1%. Organic growth in Central East Europe increased high single-digits while Middle East/Africa was down mid single-digits. Organic growth in EMEA was led by safety and graphics at 4%, health care was flat and industrial, consumer and electronics and energy each declined 1%. Please turn to slide six for the second quarter P&L highlights. Second quarter sales were $7.7 billion. Operating margins improved by 1.1 percentage points year-on-year to 23.9%. Strong gross margin improvements, along with productivity, drove the second quarter operating margin performance. Let me cover the primary components of the change in margin. On the positive side, the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 150 basis points of margin expansion. Pricing performance in the second quarter remained steady, driven by continued new product flow across our businesses and price increases in select countries to help mitigate the impact of currency devaluations. We continue to benefit from lower raw material costs and expect this trend to continue throughout the year. Commodity prices remain favorable and our global sourcing teams continue to generate additional cost reductions. Productivity remains strong in the second quarter, adding 50 basis points to margins, driven by Lean Six Sigma efforts, returns on past portfolio actions and continuing to prioritize investments. Strategic investments reduced margins by 30 basis points. This includes our ERP and business transformation effort, increased R&D investments aimed at disruptive innovation, along with portfolio management actions. These investments will strengthen 3M for the future. Finally, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced second quarter operating margins by 60 basis points. As a reminder, this year's pension expense increase is due to the adoption of new mortality tables along with a lower discount rate. For the full year we continue to expect operating margins to increase by approximately 1 percentage point. Let\u2019s now turn to slide seven for a closer look at earnings per share. Earnings per share for the second quarter was $2.02, a year-on-year increase of 5.8%. Organic growth and margin expansion contributed $0.12 to the EPS increase in the quarter. This result includes a negative $0.05 impact from higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense. Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduced pretax earnings by $110 million or the equivalent of $0.12 a share. The second quarter tax rate was 28.1% versus 29.5% in last year\u2019s comparable quarter, which increased earnings by $0.04 per share. The reduction in the tax rate versus last year\u2019s Q2 was driven by adjustments to tax reserves which were partially offset by geographic profit mix. Reserve adjustments were anticipated in our tax rate guidance. Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined by 3% versus last year\u2019s second quarter, which added $0.07 to second quarter earnings per share. Let\u2019s now review cash flow, please turn to slide number eight. Second quarter operating cash flow was $1.3 billion, down $300 million year-on-year. The majority of the year-on-year decline was due to higher cash taxes. We invested $370 million in capital expenditures during the second quarter, up $29 million year-on-year. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. Second-quarter free cash flow was $1.0 billion and we converted 74% of net income to cash. For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 90% to 100%. Cash dividends paid were $646 million in the second quarter, up $90 million year-on-year. As a reminder, we increased the per share dividend by 20% this past February, which marks the 57th consecutive year of dividend increases. Gross share repurchases were $1.7 billion in the second quarter, up $269 million compared to Q2 2014. Through the first half of 2015, we have repurchased $2.6 billion of our own shares. We now expect full-year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion versus a prior expectation of $3 billion to $5 billion. Let\u2019s now review our second quarter performance on a business-by-business basis, starting with our industrial business. Please turn to slide number nine. Industrial posted sales of $2.6 billion in the quarter, with organic local currency growth of 1.4%. Industrial\u2019s organic growth was led by 3M Purification and aerospace and commercial transportation each generating double-digit growth in the quarter. The automotive OEM business posted mid-single digit growth in the quarter versus a slight year-on-year decline in global car and light truck builds. We continue to improve our market share in this large and important market. We also delivered positive organic growth in automotive aftermarket in Q2, while the industrial adhesives and tapes business was flat. On a geographic basis, the U.S. and Latin America/Canada set the pace, with each posting organic growth of 3%. Asia Pacific was flat, while EMEA declined 1%. The industrial business delivered operating income of $609 million in the second quarter. Operating margins were a strong 23.1%, up 120 basis points year-over-year, boosted by positive price/raw materials. Let\u2019s now turn to safety and graphics on slide ten. Second quarter sales in safety and graphics were $1.4 billion, increasing 4.9% organically. All businesses within the portfolio grew organically, led by the roofing granules business, which posted strong double-digit growth in the quarter. Personal safety, one of 3M\u2019s heartland businesses, grew mid-single digits in the quarter. This business is a strategic priority for 3M for several reasons, including our strong product portfolio, fast growing end markets and increasing regulatory standards across developed and developing markets. As Inge mentioned, the Capital Safety acquisition will strengthen this business even further. Geographically, organic sales growth in safety and graphics was 9% in Asia Pacific, 6% in the U.S. and 4% in EMEA. Latin America/Canada declined 2%. Operating income was $364 million and operating margins increased 1.8 percentage points to 25.4%. Margin improvements were driven by price/raw material benefits, along with productivity and portfolio management actions. Let\u2019s now turn to health care. Please turn to slide 11. Health care delivered sales of $1.4 billion in the second quarter, with organic growth of 3.4%. We continued to see broad-based organic growth across much of the health care portfolio, including food safety, health information systems, oral care, critical and chronic care, and infection prevention. Drug delivery systems, which is a project-based business, declined year-on-year. The Ivera Medical acquisition added 70 basis points to health care sales growth in the quarter. Geographically, organic growth in health care was led by Asia Pacific at 9%, with strong contributions from both Japan and China/Hong Kong. Latin America/Canada grew 5%, the U.S. was up 4% and EMEA was flat. Health care\u2019s operating income was $440 million and margins rose 160 basis points to 32.3%. Primary drivers of margin expansion included strong productivity and price/raw material benefits. Next we will look at Electronics and Energy on slide 12. In Electronics and Energy, sales were $1.3 billion for the quarter, down 3% in organic local currency. Operating margins increased 60 basis points to 21.2% and operating income was $277 million in the quarter. Our portfolio management actions in this business continue to yield benefits for our customers and improve productivity, which is leading to strong operating margin performance. Organic local currency sales declined 2% on the electronics side of the business. As Inge commented, we experienced softer conditions in the electronics market for the quarter. The business remains focused on continuing to drive successful spec-in wins with electronic OEMs. In our energy-related businesses, organic local-currency sales were down 3, consistent with first quarter growth patterns. On a geographic basis, organic sales growth in Electronics and Energy increased 1% in the U.S., EMEA declined 1%, Asia Pacific was down 4% and Latin America/Canada declined 7%. The divestiture of the Static Control business reduced sales by 70 basis points in the second quarter. Please turn to slide 13. Second quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion, with organic growth of 3.4%. We grew organically across the portfolio, with particular strength in the do-it-yourself business, led by strong growth of Scotch Blue painter\u2019s tape. Our stationery and office supply, home care and consumer health care businesses also delivered positive organic growth in the quarter. Second quarter is typically when we begin to see the impact of the back-to-school season. Growth has been encouraging to this point, most notably in our line of Scotch brand home and office tapes and Command solutions, which eliminate the need to pound nails into walls when hanging pictures, decorations or other items. Looking at the Consumer business geographically, organic growth was led by the U.S. at 6% and Asia Pacific at 3%. Latin America/Canada was flat and EMEA declined 1%. Operating income increased to $259 million and margins were 23.3%, up 2.2 percentage points year-over-year. Margins were boosted by lower raw material costs, portfolio prioritization, strong productivity and timing of promotional programs.  That wraps up our review of the second quarter business results. I will turn it back over to Inge for an update on our 2015 planning estimates.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Nick. Overall, 3M delivered a good second quarter performance. Organic growth remained broad-based, and we continued to generate premium margins across the portfolio. Looking across 3M\u2019s entire team, I am very pleased with our execution and discipline in an uncertain economic environment, which is evident in our strong productivity. Going forward, we expect that economic uncertainty to remain through the year. In fact, external growth forecasts have continued to moderate over the last several months. As a result, today we are updating our guidance for the full year. We now expect organic growth of 2.5% to 4%, versus a prior expectation of 3% to 6%. With respect to earnings, we now anticipate EPS in the range of $7.80 to $8.00, versus a prior range of $7.80 to $8.10. The rest of the guidance remains in place. As you can see, we still expect currency to reduce sales by 6% to 7%. Our tax rate guidance is unchanged to 28.5% to 29.5%. And we continue to expect a free cash flow conversion rate of 90% to 100%. Like always, our 3M teams are focused on executing our plan, making investment for the future and managing those things within our control, in other words, controlling the controllable. As I described earlier, our portfolio is strong, and getting stronger as a result of our recent investments. Going forward, each of our businesses will continue to be bolstered by 3M\u2019s four fundamental strengths: technology, manufacturing, global capabilities and our brand. Those strengths are leveraged across our Company, and will allow us to gain market share, maintain world-class margins and generate efficient growth into future. Thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie: Thank you and good morning, everyone.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Inge, maybe just touching on organic growth for a second, you're tracking towards the lower end of the full-year guide so far year-to-date, and there still seems to be a lot of uncertainty in the environment. And so I'm just wondering, how are you thinking about your base case for the rest of the year just given what you are seeing geographically and across your product portfolio?\nInge Thulin: Well, as you recall, we saw -- all of us saw a slow economic environment coming early in the year. And after the first quarter we thought it was too early for us to change the guidance for the year. And I think it now as we moved in and saw the second quarter coming through here, I think it is the right thing to make sure that we adjust that guidance. And now you can see basically the Industrial Production Index came down even a couple of weeks ago from 2.6 to 2.1. So based on that and based on our portfolio, we think it\u2019s prudent for us to take it now to 2.5% to 4%. This is what we had earlier.  I would say, if I just comment on the organic growth for the quarter, the thing that changed for us in the quarter was basically the electronics. Electronics was two things. One was a tougher comparison versus last year. We had 10% organic local currency growth a year ago, and then there became some softness in that segment. So when I look upon it, the second quarter is very similar to the first quarter in terms of growth, excluding that piece, right. And so I think that the 2.5% to 4%, I think that\u2019s a reasonable guidance for us, and we should be able to come somewhere in the middle of that.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, that's helpful. Maybe as a follow-up there on the electronics business. Typically there is -- you see some type of seasonal uptick in the second quarter, particularly from a margin standpoint. I think very few years have you seen a sequential decline in margins on electronics. And I'm just trying to get a better understanding on what's driving the weakness. How are utilization rates? How do you view the channel from an inventory standpoint? And then how should we think about that margin trajectory moving forward?\nNick Gangestad: Joe, this is Nick. The margin -- we expanded margin here 60 basis points year-on-year against a quarter that was fairly strong, second quarter of last year. What's been enhancing our margin and will continue to enhance our margin is some of the portfolio management actions that we've been taking in that business that increase our cost competitiveness. That's what's been driving it in the last few quarters and we continue to see that driving it in the next few quarters, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. And then I guess just a commentary on the end market from a utilization standpoint and from an inventory standpoint, what\u2019s your sense for what's happening in the channel today?\nInge Thulin: Well, I don\u2019t say \u2013 I think it\u2019s more -- as you know, we are spec-in on most of the devices in the industry and what is happening from time-to-time is maybe a little bit of a delay of the new product introduction, and that will of course then impact us immediately. So I think the way I look upon this is to say we are making the same progress now as in the past relative to our spec-in. And we didn't see any big change relative to inventory levels, which you maybe then also can see relative to purchasing. So if there was a little bit of a delay of some new product introductions and they didn\u2019t build inventory, they type of slowed it down and that is impacting us as well.  I will make the comment, though, on that business, if we just put it in perspective and why I am pleased with the performance there. You recall that we started that business with margins around 15.7%, 15.8% or something, and now moved it up to 21%. And the question was always, is this volume driven? And my answer was always no. The action we have taken on the portfolio, in order to get more efficient organization, better lines to customers and have better asset utilization, meaning if we will have from a quarter that will happen in that business, a little bit slower growth, we will be able to hold margin at the high level. Meaning, it's not volume related. I think we proved that \u2013 in this quarter, we proved that model is correct. So Volume went down a little bit, and in fact we had margin expansion in that business. For that and on the work we have done on our portfolio, I'm personally very pleased with what that team had done relative to that portfolio work.\nJoe Ritchie: That's a fair point. Thanks for that. Thanks, Inge and Nick. I\u2019ll get back in queue.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe: Thanks and good morning, guys.\nInge Thulin: Hi, good morning Nigel.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning.\nNigel Coe: I think if we back out electronics and energy, which is a bit more \u2013 a little bit choppier around the quarters, I think the growth is the lowest we've seen since the recovery. So I'm just wondering, maybe just Inge, maybe just some commentary on the macro environment. Do you view this as a speed bump and can we get beyond this back into that 4% or 5% zone or do you think there's something a bit more awry here?\nInge Thulin: Well, first of all, I think let's hold it to the year, where we start talking to 2.5% to 4%, so we don't go ahead of on this ourselves relative to the future. But I think when I look upon it is to say first of all, United States is very solid. We had a 4% organic local currency growth. We grew in all businesses. It is very solid. And as you recall, hopefully recall, a quarter ago that growth was slightly lower and the question was then, are you concerned about the US? Our answer was no, not necessarily. And I think we had 4% growth here. That's good. In Asia, or APAC, Japan did well. Japan had 2% growth, excluding electronics, which is the base business, 7% growth. China was slow. It slowed down. They're type of adjusting to a new growth level there and we are now talking about mid-to-single \u2013 mid-single digit for the year. And I think we have to wait a little bit to see what will happen there. It's a big economy as you know. We have a strong position, but I think that the growth need to pick up more, specifically in the domestic markets, and health care did well for us there. The other businesses went basically sideways. West Europe, we all predicted that there will be a growth pick-up based on the euro situation. So far we have not seen that, and probably will come later in the year, but I think it will be very late in the year.  Latin America is doing fine. And as you see again, Mexico had 17% growth. Now is the first quarter in many quarters that we saw a slight improvement in Brazil. And as Nick said, Venezuela is now behind us in terms of comparison where we will go into Q3. And so I think that's my view on it. So I will say, I will not talk about higher figures than the 2.5% to 4%, at least as we go in for this year. Then we will have to see how Q3 and Q4 will work out here.\nNigel Coe: Okay, and perhaps -- Inge, thanks for that commentary. You mentioned let's see how 3Q looks. You gave some good color on the last call on 2Q trends to date, which turned out to be pretty prescient. \nInge Thulin: Can you repeat that, which one?\nNigel Coe: I'm just wondering how is 3Q tracking?\nNick Gangestad: Nigel, we're not really seeing any change in trends from what we saw in Q2. We saw things pretty stable within Q2 and we're not seeing, so far in the third quarter, any change in that pattern.\nNigel Coe: Okay, that's very helpful. And just a quick one on health care. You mentioned drug delivery as being part of base and being weak, and that was a factor last quarter. If we back out the impacts of drug delivery, how does that look? How does health care look ex that?\nNick Gangestad: That business in total, Nigel, brought down the growth for health care by approximately 1 percentage point.\nNigel Coe: Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. \nJermaine Brown: Thank you, good morning.\nInge Thulin: Hi, David.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning.\nJermaine Brown: This is actually Jermaine Brown filling in for David.\nInge Thulin: Okay, well, good morning to you.\nJermaine Brown: Two questions. Good morning. Your gross margins in Q2 expanded only slightly more than Q1. For H2, should we expect a greater raw material benefit? Or is Q1 and Q2 a good guide for what we should expect for margins within the second half?\nNick Gangestad: We see the raw material benefits being pretty evenly spread between first half and second half. I would say the first half is a very good guide for the second half.\nJermaine Brown: Understood. And my second question is, your demand within Asia-Pacific, particularly China, decelerated. I'd imagine that some of that was due to lower electronics demand. But were there any other businesses or end markets that also contributed to that decline?\nNick Gangestad: Our declines there, we were up in our health care business. Electronics and energy was, yes of course, one of the declines. The others in China/Hong Kong were a deceleration from the growth we saw in the first quarter.\nJermaine Brown: Okay. And then one month into Q3, what are you seeing demand-wise within Asia-Pacific?\nNick Gangestad: As I said earlier, what we're seeing in Q3, so far no change in trajectory from what we saw in the second quarter or for the first half.\nJermaine Brown: Understood. I will hop back in queue. That's all that I have. Thank you.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Winoker: Thanks and good morning, guys.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Steven.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning. \nSteven Winoker: Could you talk a little bit about -- I want to dive into Capital Safety a little bit since I haven\u2019t had the opportunity to do much of that. You talked about, in the release, 14 times EBITDA multiple, I think that included synergies. It's clearly a very -- at least I think it's a very attractive company and segment. But maybe talk through, number one, what was that multiple excluding that impact in that one-year timeframe? And how do you think about pricing in general, given that you're obviously allocating more funds to bigger M&A? I'm just trying to get a sense for how you thought about the return profile on that one and in general.\nInge Thulin: First of all, the Capital Safety is in our view, a perfect fit for 3M. Fall protection, which is the segment, is among the fastest-growing and most profitable segments in the PP industry. And Capital Safety is recognized as a leader in fall protection. So you take those things together, there is high complementary synergy to 3M's global business in personal safety, which is a heartland division.  So Capital Safety, if think about it, it provides accretive growth to us and also margins, both for safety and graphics and for overall 3M. And you saw the start again for safety and graphics which is very, very good, and have as I said earlier, is the business group that I thought will have the real break-out as we go. So I think it is a very valued and good acquisition to us.  The component annual sales growth had been over 10% for the four last years and EBITDA margins is approaching 40%. You have all those type of things that you lay them back to the portfolio work we did where you say, well you know \u2013 well, how can we build out our businesses and make sure that we get more relevance with our customers as we move ahead and drive synergies?  So what I think about it in totality, and the figures you are quoting there is correct, is actually 12x based on five-year run rate synergies. But I think this is for us a terrific acquisition that is building out our position.\nSteven Winoker: Okay. And so do you think about it in terms of return on capital over that timeframe as well?\nNick Gangestad: Certainly, Steve. We're looking at return on capital and looking at the time it takes us to bring this back to a return on capital. And for us that's in the fifth or sixth year that we see this meeting, on a cash basis, our return on capital -- our cost of capital. \nSteven Winoker: Okay, all right. And then just on the pricing versus raws, you already talked about the raws comment. Pricing was another 1% again this quarter, very strong, obviously dealing with FX and issues. Can we talk about the sustainability of pricing within that equation going forward?\nNick Gangestad: On the margin front, just to clarify, of that 150 basis points about 60 of those basis points are coming from our price growth, and 90 basis points from our raw material reductions. As far as the sustainability of price, we're at about 1% price -- we are at a 1% price increase on average through the first half of the year. We see that trend sustaining through the second half of the year.\nSteven Winoker: Okay. And is that mostly just again, that's independent of new products. It's just pure price increases on the existing portfolio?\nNick Gangestad: On our existing portfolio. I would add the color that if you look at all of our price growth, the fact that we keep refreshing our product line with our investments that we're making in research and development, that does enable us through the value we are creating for our customers, to be able to sustain pricing growth. But the other part of our price growth in the second quarter and for the year is also driven by movements related to FX. If I look at second-quarter standalone, of our total price growth, we estimate 25% of that total price growth is coming from pricing based on the value we are creating for our customers, and 75% based on movements we're taking directly or indirectly related to FX movements.\nSteven Winoker: Okay, that's very helpful, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Good morning, guys. I was a little bit surprised in Capital Safety you said year five or six reach your cost to capital. And I'm assuming your -- I mean, I'll ask the question what you think your cost of capital is, but let's just say for the sake of argument it's somewhere in the 9% range. I would think when you're buying a business like this in an industry you know so well and so easily integratable, that you'd be able to earn a higher return on that. On the other side of it just indicates that maybe you overpaid. I hate to be skeptical on that stuff, but can you address it a bit?\nNick Gangestad: Part of our portfolio prioritization is we know the assets we want to buy. We know where we can drive the most value. As we look at this business integrated with our personal safety business, we do see cost synergies that we'll be deriving. We see sales synergies, both of those contributing to get that result. What you're seeing here, Scott, is a result of us having a clear vision of what we wanted to add to our portfolio, and also an asset that we could see bringing a good financial return to 3M.\nScott Davis: I think that partially answers it. Partially what I'm saying is, if you look at future acquisitions, is this going to be the type of hurdle rate you're looking for going forward? Because from my perspective, you would probably, is all you can do is earn 8% or 9% return five years out and there's risk, you could probably get that just buying your own stock.\nInge Thulin: The answer to that is, is not necessarily, Scott. I think you have to look upon this -- first look upon this acquisition first of all, clearly strategic in terms of the outcome of the portfolio work, right? So that's, I think that's an important element. There are certain pieces of the business that can be integrated and where we can drive synergy, others cannot. The reason for that is that there's a high element of regulation and education in that fall protection. So we need to continue to invest in that and make sure that we do everything that is right. So there is two elements into it, right. Some pieces from the commercialization perspective where we can drive a lot of synergy, and we will. And the other piece, I think we still need to figure out how we can accelerate that to get the return even faster. It's a highly regulated business, as you know. And then by that, the advantage of that, the barrier to enter is very high. So you have to think about it, you get it integrated and as you move on it, you have to make sure that you can drive more synergy. But the answer to your question, necessarily not. This was a specific case. This is a very important strategic move for us in order to build out our position here, and it's a high-class asset. It is a high-class asset that is very similar to 3M in terms of margins, returns and growth and so forth. So we can always --\nScott Davis: I agree. I think more specifically, just trying to get a sense of the future.\nInge Thulin: The other thing here, Scott, if you look upon the other acquisitions we have done from Sumitomo to Ceradyne, et cetera, we are not even close to this, right. I will say that, we can always argue day out and day in of the valuation. Did you pay too much or whatever? This is a strategic fantastic move for us with a world-class asset. So I'm pleased with that piece and now it is up to us to drive the return even faster back to us.\nScott Davis: Okay, that's a good answer. Just to be a little bit more, dig into a little bit more detail on that, you mentioned EBITDA margin of 40% on Capital Safety. Is that something -- can that be a 50% EBIDTA margin business or is it more a function you can bring Capital Safety in and the rest of your safety products businesses to co-opt? Or is it Capital Safety itself can see a margin lift?\nNick Gangestad: Scott, we see modest gross margin expansion opportunities there. We probably see more of our cost synergy benefits coming from the back office SG&A front than on the gross margin front.\nScott Davis: Okay, that's helpful. So thanks, guys, I will pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC, please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you, good morning, everyone, and let me say congrats to Matt and Bruce on their new responsibilities. Sorry to pile on the Capital Safety deal, but this was the largest deal you have ever done. And if I'm not mistaken, this was not the first time you had the opportunity to buy this asset. Why did you pass on it before? And then you are already in fall protection because I've been to trade shows where we've had demonstrations of fall protection. So how does Capital Safety expand your product line and where might there be overlaps?\nInge Thulin: You're right, Deane, that we had a small presence in that segment. We were very, very small. And one thing that I've learned over the years I've done business, if you do not have a reasonable good market share position, you will over time lose out. I've been in businesses over time where you think that a couple of percentage market share will take you to a better position. Is a very, very tough, so you need to come into a leading position. So that was one. So yes, we were there. We were, in my view, not relevant enough for the industry. So very opportunistic. Now let's go back to your comment relative to why now. I talked about it in my speech before, but I have to go back to it because I think this is an important element. If you don't have a clear picture of where you would like to go in the future with your portfolio, you could have a tendency to try to be part of auctions on most things that are becoming available. If you are part of bidding on more things that are becoming available, you maybe don't really know if this is a real important strategic imperative for you, and you should go for it. I would say, I was not part of 2008 and 2010, whatever, when there was bid on that asset. But maybe at that point in time it was not clear enough relative to the portfolio where we should invest for the future. This time, it was very, very clear for me where we should go. That's the answer from me.\nDeane Dray: Inge, thanks for that context. Just one follow-up on the Mexico organic revenue growth, 17% really jumps out. What was driving that and expectations for the balance of the year?\nInge Thulin: Mexico has now been growing for almost two years, right, doing very, very well. And its -- I would say a combination of both domestic market growing well there, but also the overall Mexican economy in terms of exports, specifically into the United States. And we have a very good portfolio balance in Mexico. As you know, we've been there for a long time and we're able to capitalize on that. So I don't know exactly if I can give you the -- No, no, but his question is about the outlook for the year in Mexico. I think our growth rate here today is around 15% and I don't expect for the rest of the year that would slow down. But all businesses doing well there and specifically industrial is growing very, very fast.\nDeane Dray: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Good morning guys. On this China expectation for the year up mid-single digits, China/Hong Kong, it was up 7% in the first, down 2% in the second. What gets better from here to even get you to the mid-single digits? I mean, you talked about some inventory channel adjustments, maybe just any other color on what you expect to improve from the current rate?\nInge Thulin: I think that, first of all, I believe that health care will continue. He had a good quarter in health care. Health care will continue and consumer will improve specifically. I also think that the industrial business, that is a sizable business for us there will improve slightly as we go for the year. So when you think about our portfolio, we get industrial slightly better. We get consumer up a little bit, which we will. And then health care continuing. That will take us there. I don't comment on electronics because, as you know, electronics is that kind of business that is on a regional base. Sometimes Japan is doing better than China and so forth, right. So, let's see how much that will be executed in China. But I think there's still a time here that we have to see the adjustment in the Chinese market. But those three businesses specifically will improve for us slightly as we go for the rest of the year.\nShannon O'Callaghan: And in terms of those improvements in industrial and consumer, is that based on just sort of timing or ending of channel reductions? Or is this improvement in the economy?\nInge Thulin: Yeah, yeah, now that is what we are counting on. We cannot count on anything else, right but that's what we are counting on.\nShannon O'Callaghan: The channel being kind of cleared out and getting back to more normal?\nInge Thulin: Yeah.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Okay, and then within the industrial business, I mean, all the end markets you commented on sounded reasonably good, but the whole segment grew 1.4%. Was there anything within that segment that was dragging it down from the decent trends in auto and other stuff?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, our industrial adhesives and tape business within industrial, that's one of the businesses that was flat. And that contributed to bringing the total organic growth down. Abrasives is another business that was down.\nShannon O'Callaghan: And that was I mean going to a ton of different end markets [indiscernible] one thing, right?\nNick Gangestad: Exactly. Including, in the case of abrasives, there's some oil and gas exposure there.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin: Hey, guys, good morning. Just to clarify on the Safety acquisition, you said it's going to be dilutive in the first 12 months. When are we expecting to close it? In the third quarter, right? Is that dilution incorporated in the updated guidance?\nNick Gangestad: Andrew, yeah, we've said that for the first 12 months, we expect this to be dilutive to GAAP EPS by $0.04. We expect this to close in the third quarter, in the middle of the third quarter, and our guidance is not yet including the impact of either the Capital Safety or the completion of the Polypore acquisition.\nAndrew Obin: And just to clarify, in terms of -- oil prices have been coming down quite a bit since the end of the quarter. And I know you've updated what you think the impact is going to be in terms of your inputs. But when did you update your outlook for oil prices? Is it updated for the decline that we've seen over the past several weeks?\nNick Gangestad: Yeah, it is updated. And similar to what I said in April where we see ourselves now at the high end of the range of $0.25 benefit on raw materials, benefits as well as the margin impact I talked about earlier, that's reflecting where we are the most recently with commodity prices. So yes, it is reflecting that, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: And just a broader question. All of a sudden North America, US is the fastest growing market, right, it has lower margins, emerging markets are slowing. Are you guys thinking about adjusting your longer-term plan, given where the macro is playing out? Or do you think the existing game plan is adaptable to what you're seeing?\nInge Thulin: Yeah, the existing game plan is adaptable to what we are seeing. There's no change from that thinking at that point in time. And as you know, if you think about the five-year plan, we are three years into it. And there's always some changes going in and out in the plan, right, in terms of all metrics.  But at this point in time -- of course from an execution perspective on where you invest for manufacturing and so forth, there are some differences now versus when they were three years ago, or where will you invest in international, right, or will you do it in the United States. So I think that's a business call on a day-to-day business. But at this point in time, there's no change from the overall plan, and our play-book is working. Our play-book is working.\nAndrew Obin: Terrific, thank you very much.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, good morning.\nNick Gangestad: Hey, good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: So I guess just back to Shannon's question, but at a little more of a broad sense. Can you give us a little color on what you would expect on a core basis for kind of how the third and the fourth quarter play out? I know that you have a little bit of an easier comp in the third, and then a tougher comp in the fourth. I'm just kind of curious to see, to his question, just more broadly, what gets better here from the 1.8% that you put up this quarter?\nNick Gangestad: Okay, Steve, just to clarify, you're talking total company?\nSteve Tusa: Total-co or core. So the 1.8%, what does the 1.8%, kind of how does that trend in the third and the fourth quarter? Is it steady or is it a little bit better in the third? Worse in the fourth?\nNick Gangestad: In our 2.5% to 4%, I can't say we're seeing a noticeable difference between the third and fourth quarter, if you're looking for some color on that, Steve. On the low end of the range, it would be a continuation of the growth rate that we've seen in the first half, that continues into both the third and fourth quarter. If we're a shade towards the middle or the high end of the range, we would expect to start to see that occurring in the third quarter and not all in the fourth quarter.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And did things get -- how did things trend as you kind of went around the quarter? How was kind of April, May, June type of dynamics?\nNick Gangestad: When we look on this on a sales per billing day, we saw virtually no change in our trends between the three months of the second quarter.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And then one last question just on the pricing dynamics. I guess you said 70% or 75% of that are kind of forex related. So I mean as we kind of lap these for-ex comps I guess as we move into next year, I guess you're going to have a first-quarter comp. So does that mean that 1% is probably -- since your second half is probably going to be a little bit less than 7% year-over-year, I guess, on forex? Does that mean that 1% kind of starts to fade in total as we move forward?\nNick Gangestad: To the extent that there's a portion of that 1% related to FX, over time, I see that fading, but not in the second half of the year. If it does fade, it will be minimal. The logical extension is we see some fading of that in '16, not a material amount of fading in the second half of 2015.\nSteve Tusa: And on the 0.2% in US, so is that a good kind of reflection on, I guess, the US is probably your most stable market. Is that a good reflection of kind of what you're seeing on the price inflation side? Presumably customers will come back seeing what you guys are doing on the raws side. I mean, is it a little bit tougher to get price these days because of what's going on with raw materials? This is more of a kind of macro question, I guess, as well.\nInge Thulin: Well, you would assume it would be, but I think one of the advantages for us is that often our product is adding some additional profitability and productivity to our customers. So I would say, yes, a little bit tougher. But as long as you are focused on new product that's adding value into the end market, you are able to demand a slightly higher price.\nSteve Tusa: Right, great, thanks a lot. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: I just want to follow up on the industrial business. You talked about some inventory issues there in the second quarter. I just wondered how severe those were and if you thought that that inventory had largely been cleared out, so in the third quarter we should see a better industrial organic growth rate.\nInge Thulin: Yeah. I would say that I think it will be cleared out, early Q3 is my view. Right. And I think when you listen to the results for the industrial and many businesses did well. There's a capital business that I will describe more as they're not spec-in, right or designing, they're more in the consumable side like abrasives and tape and so forth. That's where we had a little bit of temper and I think that then holding to the channels. But I'm more optimistic as we move forward relative to that front for industrial. The other businesses there, if you think about aerospace and commercial and transportation at another 10% growth, purification another 10%, automotive OEM, as Nick said, has 6%. So many businesses there are doing very well. There were two divisions that had an impact for the quarter and it was very much what I would describe as consumables into industrial tapes and adhesives and abrasives.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks. And then my follow-up would just be on the free cash conversion. Is it just the tax normalization in the second half that pushes up the conversion? Or is there something else happening with working capital, for example?\nNick Gangestad: Julian, there's a few things at play here. First of all, when we pay our cash taxes, there is some timing, and second quarter happened to be heavier weighted. That will moderate for the total year. Second quarter was also a quarter of higher than normal amount of our total pension contribution occurring in the second quarter. And then the last piece is we did see some increases in our working capital and we expect that also to moderate in the second half of the year, all of the three of those contributing to improvement in our working capital into the second half. Those are what I'd adjust for. We have normal adjustments where, for instance for compensation, that always has a noticeable improvement in our free cash flow conversion in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year.\nJulian Mitchell: Great, thank you.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLaurence Alexander: Good morning, two quick ones. \nInge Thulin: Hi, Laurence.\nLaurence Alexander: Good morning. As you look across your portfolio in terms of where you either have a stronger new product pipeline or a high degree of confidence about pent-up demand, do you see any line of sight for acceleration in 2016, 2017 in any of your larger product categories? And secondly, if this choppy, soft demand environment continues for a few more years, how does that effect, if at all, your balance sheet targets?\nInge Thulin: Well, Nick will give you some comment on the balance sheet. Let me just comment relative to the, let's say, business groups. First of all, there is a very robust pipeline of new products in each individual business groups. So I don't see, from that perspective, a difference in between them. But when I look upon it, we have some businesses here that is -- industrial is 33% of our portfolio, and very strong. And we are now adding, even, an acquisition into that moving forward. And I think that what I call a design or spec-in there is a very strong credible business. So I think it will be strong. I think, as I said earlier, safety and graphics, I talked about that for over a year now, that I believe that safety and graphics is the next breakout business group for us, as electronics and energy came earlier. The margin has expanded quite a bit there and I predicted that safety and graphics will follow, and maybe do even better due to the fact of the portfolio there. And I'm confident that that will happen. And you see our health care business. Health care business is usually the fastest growing, highest margin for us. And 80% of that portfolio is in the developed world, meaning only 20% in the developing, and that way a lot of growth for us is coming. And again, I would say, yes, when I look upon it and try to be objective, you see the performance of our consumer business. Again, with a very good growth I would say, and margin expansion and a very strong brand equity. So I would say for the future for what we're doing here, I'm optimistic. And it's been a lot of work on the portfolio side, get more efficiency and organization, try to reduce unnecessary barriers internally. And as we say here at 3M that the productivity is important and complexity is the biggest enemy of productivity. And the whole team is working on that big time. So I would not make a distinction in between there. We are in a good position everywhere.\nNick Gangestad: Laurence, just a follow-up close on the last piece, you were asking about the balance sheet. Our strategy with our balance sheet, as far as our capital structure and our allocation of capital, we see that our strategy there robust enough to encompass a number of business models, including a lower growth scenario. On the margin, what would change, and again, this would be volatile of exactly why we're seeing that more -- lower growth world. But for example, CapEx, our capital allocation strategy, I think it would be natural to assume there would be less of our capital going into our CapEx capacity building. In terms of M&A, that would depend on our view of the valuation of the opportunities. It could have an impact where things become more attractive to us, but that's highly driven by the opportunities that we see presenting at that time.\nMatt Ginter: Laurence, this is Matt. We wouldn't see anything changing in terms of organic growth being the primary way in which we grow. We obviously dial CapEx to whatever levels of growth we're seeing, but it doesn't fundamentally change the way we think about growth, acquisition versus M&A.\nLaurence Alexander: Thank you.\nNick Gangestad: Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answers portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.\nMatt Ginter: Well, thank you very much for participating this morning. We look forward to seeing you very soon. Good-bye."}, {"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 1, "year": 2015, "date": "2015-04-23 14:34:03", "content": "Executives: Matt Ginter - Vice President, Investor Relations Inge Thulin - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer Nicholas Gangestad - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAnalysts: Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Scott Davis - Barclays Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets Steven Winoker - Bernstein Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley Robert McCarthy - Stifel Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Laurence Alexander - Jefferies\nOperator: Welcome to the 3M first quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nMatt Ginter: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2015 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. As a reminder, please mark your calendars for upcoming earnings call dates, July 23, October 22 and January 26. Also take note of our next Investor Meeting, which is scheduled for December 15. More details will be available as we get closer to that date. Today's earnings release and the slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 2. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to Slide 3, and I will hand out to Inge.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today. 3M executed well and delivered another solid quarter of operational performance. We once again posted broad-based organic sales growth and continued to improve profitability. Importantly, we achieved these against a more challenging first quarter economic backdrop. The rising U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenues and profits, offset in part by hedging gains. In addition, global economic growth slowed, which we saw a bit in our growth figures. As 3M always does, we continue to manage two things within our control; execute our plan and build for the future. I'll take you through the first quarter highlights. Earnings were $1.85 per share, up 3% year-over-year. Sales were $7.6 billion in the quarter, down 3% versus last year. Organic local currency growth was 3.3%. For the seventh consecutive quarter, 3M posted organic growth in every business group as well as across all geographic areas. As I mentioned, the U.S. dollar strengthening significantly against a number of currencies, reducing sales by 6.5%. We expanded company-wide margins to 23%, up nearly a full percentage point from last year, and all business groups delivered margins greater than 21%. Rising margins and broad-based organic growth are more evidence that our portfolio actions over the last three years are paying off. This quarter 3M took a number of additional steps to strengthening our portfolio. We announce plans to acquire Polypore's Separations Media business for $1 billion, which will enhance our core filtration platform. Last month, we completed acquisition of Ivera Medical, a good addition to our Health Care business; and at the same time, we completed the sales of our Static Control business in January. Also in the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And finally, we increased the first quarter dividend by 20% on top of 35% increase last year. Nick will now go through the details of the quarter. Nick?\nNicholas Gangestad: Thanks, Inge, and good mornings, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4, where I'll review the components of our first quarter sales change. As Inge mentioned, in the quarter we delivered positive organic growth in all business groups and geographic areas. Worldwide organic local currency growth was 3.3% with volumes up 2.3% and selling prices up 1%. Two Health Care related acquisitions, namely, Treo Solutions and Ivera Medical, added 10 basis points to growth. This impact was offset by the divestiture of the Static Control business, which reduced sales by 10 basis points. The stronger U.S. dollar reduced sales by 6.5%. In U.S. dollars total sales declined 3.2% versus the first quarter of 2014. The U.S. dollar strengthened significantly versus several foreign currencies during the first quarter, continuing the trend that began in 2014. In particular, the average euro rate declined 18% versus the U.S. dollar year-on-year. The yen declined 14% and the Brazilian real 19%. Looking more closely at organic local currency growth, Asia-Pacific led the way at 5.6%. Safety and Graphics again posted the strongest growth in APAC at 9%, followed by Health Care at 8% and Electronics and Energy at 7%. Organic growth was 7% in China/Hong Kong or 8%, excluding electronics, similar to recent quarters. Japan was up against a challenging comp. Recall that Japan's organic growth was 20% in the first quarter of last year, leading up to the April 1, 2014, consumption tax increase. EMEA organic growth was slightly positive in the first quarter, with West Europe flat, Central East Europe up mid-single digits and Middle East/Africa down slightly. Organic growth in EMEA was led by Electronics and Energy and Safety and Graphics at 4% and 1%, respectively. We posted 4% organic growth in Latin America/Canada, where Industrial, Safety and Graphics and Health Care, all grew 5%. Mexico delivered another outstanding result with 15% organic growth in the quarter and Brazil was down 2%. The United States grew 3.1% organically with Industrial, Health Care and Consumer, each growing 4%; Safety and Graphics and Electronics and Energy, each grew 3%. Please turn to Slide 5 for the first quarter P&L highlights. First quarter sales were $7.6 billion, down 3.2%. Operating income on the other hand increased nearly 1% to $1.7 billion, and earnings rose over 3% to $1.85 per share. Early in the year, it became apparent that business conditions would be more uncertain, particularly given that the U.S. dollar was moving higher. As always, we had contingency plans in place and we executed those plans as Q1 played out. Gross margin improvements and strong SG&A productivity, allowed us to increase first quarter operating margins by 90 basis points year-on-year to 22.8%. For the full year, we expect operating margins to increase by a minimum of 1 percentage point. Let's take a closer look at this quarter's margin improvement. Organic volume leverage added 20 basis points to operating margins, and the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 120 basis points of margin expansion. We continued to generate positive selling prices changes across our businesses, boosted by 3M's world-class material science and strong new product flow, both of which are important elements of our business model. In addition, we have been raising prices in select countries to help mitigate the impact of currency devaluations. On the raw material front, we are benefiting from both lower commodity prices and from our sourcing team's ongoing negotiation efforts. We expect raw material benefits to gain momentum, as the year progresses. Productivity added 30 basis points to margins, as spending remains under good control in the quarter, and foreign currency impacts, net of hedge gains, were neutral to margins. First year acquisitions were 10 basis points dilutive to our operating margin in the quarter. In addition, we continue to make other strategic investments, including disruptive R&D programs, along with business transformation and ERP. These investments reduced operating margins by 20 basis points year-on-year. Finally, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced first quarter operating margins by 50 basis points. As a reminder, this year's pension increase is a result of the adoption of new mortality tables along with a lower discount rate. Summarizing the first quarter P&L, our teams executed well in the face of currency headwinds and a more mixed economic backdrop. EPS expanded year-on-year and margins increased by nearly 1 percentage point. Now, let's turn to Slide 6 for a closer look at earnings per share. Earnings for the first quarter were $1.85 per share, an increase of 3.4%. Organic growth and margin expansion contributed $0.14 to the EPS increase in the quarter. This included a $0.04 headwind from higher pension and OPEB expense. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, reduced pre-tax earnings by $90 million or the equivalents of $0.10 a share. The first quarter tax rate was 29.5% versus 27.4% in the comparable quarter, which reduced earnings per share by $0.05. The increase was due to geographic mix, which was influenced by the strong U.S. dollar. In addition, Q1 2014 included a one-time benefit that did not repeat. Average diluted shares outstanding declined by 4% versus last year's first quarter, which added $0.07 to first quarter earnings per share. Now, let's review cash flow performance on Slide number 7. We generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, in line with Q1 2014. Capital expenditures were $291 million consistent with last year's first quarter. Our full year expected CapEx range is $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, down $100 million versus prior estimates, all due to the stronger U.S. dollar. First quarter free cash flow was $789 million, and we converted 66% of net income to cash, in line with last year's first quarter. Note that the first quarter is typically our seasonal low. For the full year, we continue to expect to be in the rage of 90% to 100%. As Inge mentioned earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 20%. We paid out $652 million in cash dividends during the quarter. Gross share repurchases were $886 million in the first quarter, and we continue to plan $3 billion to $5 billion for the full year. Now, let's review our first quarter performance on a business-by-business basis. Please go to Slide number 8. Industrial with sales of $2.7 billion delivered organic local currency growth of 3% in the quarter. Our aerospace and commercial transportation, automotive OEM and 3M Purification businesses, all generated high single-digit growth. We also posted positive organic growth in advanced materials and industrial adhesives and tapes. On a geographic basis, Latin America/Canada set the pace, with organic growth of 5%. The U.S. was up 4%; Asia Pacific increased 3%; and EMEA was flat. We continue to invest for the future within Industrial. During the quarter, we announced our intent to acquire Polypore's Separations Media business for $1 billion. This business is a leading provider of microporous membranes and modules for filtration in the life sciences, industrial and specialty segments. The acquisition will enhance 3M's core filtration platform and help generate new growth opportunities across the company. Wrapping up on Industrial's first quarter performance, operating income was $598 million and operating margins were 22.5%, up 20 basis points versus last year's Q1. Now, let's turn to Safety and Graphics on Slide 9. First quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.4 billion, increasing 4% organically. Personal safety grew high single-digits in the quarter. Workers safety remains a high priority for manufacturers globally, and we're gaining share. In addition, our respiratory products are continuing to sell well in China, where air quality is an ongoing concern. Commercial solutions and traffic safety and security, each posted positive organic growth, while roofing granules declined year-on-year. Asia-Pacific delivered 9% organic growth, Latin America/Canada increased 5%, the U.S. was up 3% and EMEA increased 1%. Operating income was $335 million and operating margins increased 2.1 percentage points to 24.4%. Margins in this business continue to be boosted by strong productivity and a keen focus on prioritization and portfolio management. Let's now turn to Health Care on Slide 10. Health Care delivered sales of $1.3 billion and organic growth of 3%. Growth was strongest in food safety, critical in chronic care and health information systems. Our infection prevention and oral care businesses also posted positive growth in the quarter. The drug delivery systems business declined year-over-year. Geographically, organic growth in Asia-Pacific was 8%, while Latin America/Canada and the U.S. each grew 4%, EMEA declined 1%. In developing markets, Health Care grew 10% organically, marking the 13 consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This has been a high-priority investment area of ours for some time, as healthcare markets rapidly evolve in developing countries. In March, we successfully closed the acquisition of Ivera Medical Corporation. This business will enhance 3M's vascular access products offerings to healthcare facilities. Integration is going smoothly and we look forward to expanding this business globally. Health Care's operating income was $408 million and margins remain strong at 30.7%. Note that first quarter margins absorbed 40 basis points of dilution from the Ivera and Treo acquisitions. Therefore, underlying margins were 31.1%. Next, we will look at Electronics and Energy on Slide 11. Electronics and Energy delivered 6% organic local currency growth in the first quarter, with sales of $1.3 billion. Organic local currency sales grew 12% in our electronics related businesses, as we continue to see strong consumer demand enhanced by spec-in wins at several OEMs. In our energy related businesses, organic local currency sales declined 3%. The electrical markets business was flat, while telecom and renewable energy both declined year-on-year. On a geographic basis, organic growth in Electronics and Energy increased 7% in Asia-Pacific, 4% in EMEA and 3% in both U.S. and Latin America/Canada. The divestiture of the Static Control Business, which closed on January 2, 2015, reduced sales by 90 basis points in the first quarter. As a reminder, sales for this business were $46 million in 2014. Operating income for Electronics and Energy was $283 million and margins increased 4.1 percentage points year-over-year to 21.4%. Recent portfolio management actions are improving our relevance with customers, enhancing our growth capabilities and contributing to higher productivity and margins. Please turn to Slide 12. First quarter sales in Consumer were $1 billion, with organic growth of 2%. All four businesses in Consumer grew organically, led by Do-It-Yourself and Home Care, each growing mid-single digit. Looking by geography, the U.S. grew 4% and Asia-Pacific increased 2%. EMEA and Latin America/Canada declined slightly year-on-year. Operating income increased to $240 million and margins were 22.9%. Margins rose 1.7 percentage points year-over-year. The business continues to drive efficiencies through investment prioritization and executing on productivity programs. Before turning to our 2015 outlook, let me comment on corporate and unallocated. Net expense was $100 million in the first quarter versus $72 million in Q1 of 2014, with U.S. and pension postretirement expenses being the primary reason for the increase. For the full year, we estimate corporate and unallocated net expense to be approximately $400 million. That wraps up our first quarter results. Please turn to Slide 13, where I will address our full year planning estimates.On organic growth, we expect 3% to 6% for the year, so no change versus prior thinking. Foreign currency translation is forecasted to reduce 2015 U.S. dollar sales by 6% to 7%, up from a previous range of 4% to 5%. For the second quarter specifically, we expect FX to reduce sales by 8%. With respect to earnings, we now anticipate full year EPS of $7.80 to $8.10 per share versus a previous estimate of $8 to $8.30 per share. In our fourth quarter business review on January 27, recall that we estimated our foreign currency impacts would reduce 2015 earnings by approximately $0.20 per share. Of course, since then the dollar has strengthened further. Today we estimate that foreign currency impacts will reduce 2015 full year earnings by $0.35 to $0.40 per share, or an incremental headwind of $0.15 to $0.20 per share versus our January estimates. These figures are net of hedging. For Q2 in particular, we anticipate that foreign currency impacts will reduce earnings by $0.13 per share. For the tax rate, we anticipate a range of 28.5% to 29.5% versus 28% to 29% prior. The stronger U.S. dollar is impacting our profit mix by country, which is leading to a higher effective tax rate. Finally, no change as it relates to free cash flow conversion. We continue to expect a range of 90% to 100% for the year. I will now turn the call back to Inge for a few final comments.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Nick. I am pleased with the performance of our team in the first quarter. We executed our playbook and delivered solid results in a tougher external environment. Now, more than ever, our teams remain keenly focus on efficient growth, focused both on organic growth, and of course, productivity. As Nick described, we also took a number of additional steps to carefully manage first quarter expenses in anticipation of a difficult economic environment, clearly necessary given external realities. As we navigate short term challenges we also continue to invest for long-term success. This includes portfolio investments, as I mentioned earlier, as well as our ongoing commitment to building our core strengths. I have talked to you before about 3M's four fundamental strengths, which are leveraged across our enterprise: technology, manufacturing, global capabilities and our brand. On technology, for example, we increased R&D investment in the quarter while at the same time managing our SG&A investments very carefully. We expanded 3M's global capabilities including breaking ground on the new customer innovation center in Chengdu in West China. As you heard from Nick, our 3M China team continues to execute well delivering 7% organic growth. We remain very optimistic about 3M's future in China. And our new innovation center in West China will allow us to collaborate even more closely both, the local and global customers and help us take advantage of growing opportunities in that region in China. In March, we also refreshed our brand platform, which includes our new tagline: 3M Science Applied to Life. Through our brand work, we will enhance awareness of how 3M uses science to solve problems and improve lives. So in summary, it was a solid first quarter for 3M. Our team performed well against tough economical headwinds, and we continue to make investments for the future. And by that we are now open to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: Inge, perhaps maybe just focusing on organic growth for a second, the 3%-plus that you did this quarter was towards the lower end of your full year range, and yet as you progressed through the year your comps are going to get a little bit more difficult, so maybe you can just talk about the portfolio and the confidence and perhaps seeing some organic growth acceleration as the year progresses.\nInge Thulin: Yes, you're right. It was little bit slower than we have seen in the past. The way I looked upon it is specifically as you came off Q4, it was around 6%, but I think overall when you look upon the economy around the world, the fourth quarter was much stronger than what we saw in the first quarter on a global basis. So I think first of all, our performance relative to IPI is in the level as we have seen in the past. I think when you look upon our performance, as you see there, you see a little bit of lower growth in Health Care, which is related to basically one thing, but you can add them together. One, it's relative to West Europe and it's relative to our Drug Delivery Systems, that is I would say, a project-based business. So you will have some businesses going in and out of that business based on yearend or quarter. So when I look at on Health Care, that's basically where you can see. And our core business in Health Care did very well again, and as you see we maintain very high margin, et cetera. And when I look upon Industrial, we had 4% growth in United States for Industrial in the quarter, which is acceptable, and I think that was related very much to and became maybe some uncertainty generally speaking around what will happen to export due to the dollar strengthening and also what you saw in oil. I think people, specifically not so much what is designed in and spec-in, but maybe on the consumables, just became a little bit cautious as you went into the quarter. So I don't see that as an issue either. And as you know that's a big business for us, and we continue to invest in IBG. When I say big, it's our biggest. It's 33% of our portfolio. So again Electronic and Energy did very well. After the reorganization and realignment of that business now over two years ago, we really get good traction based on our relevance to customers and speed to market, et cetera. And Safety and Graphics had also a good quarter, and specifically in personal safety that is going into respiratory business, we are doing very well on a global basis, even it was maybe a little bit slow in West Europe in the quarter, but very well in Asia again and whole of APAC doing very, very well. And then finally, Consumer, that you saw had a 2% growth; 4% was in U.S. which is our bigger business. And I will say that the slowness was in West Europe, and Latin America was slow for them. So as we all know, a quarter stops and ends there is always something going in and out of the quarter. I look very carefully on six months comparisons going back over two years, and when we look upon that over two years with six months comparisons, because you don't know always if new story is coming in Q1 or Q2, et cetera. We have for the last two years on that comparison been in the range of 4% to 6%, always in 4% to 5% during that period. So this was on the low end, but still in the 3% to 6% that we have set for the year and when we look upon and talk to the businesses what we see going out for the year, we say that maybe Q2 would be very similar to Q1, maybe slight improvement, but we do not count too much on that. And then you will see for the rest of the year that more growth will come.\nJoe Ritchie: And maybe my one follow-up question for Nick. Can you decompose the price cost for the quarter? You had 120 basis points in benefit, what portion of it was related to FX? And can you elaborate a little bit on the raw material piece gaining momentum as the year progresses?\nNicholas Gangestad: Sure, Joe, happy to break that down. As I said earlier in total those components price in raw materials added a 120 basis points. You can split that right down the middle. Half of that is coming from selling price increases, and half of that is coming from lower raw material commodity prices that we're paying. And then in total what we recorded for 1% price growth for the first quarter, Joe, about two-thirds of that is directly or indirectly driven by FX movements, and about one-third of that is driven by 3M innovation and the new product flow we have.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays.\nScott Davis: A little bit of strange question for you, Inge, but when you think about China, up 7% is a very, very respectable number, but Consumer is up kind of 2-ish, and you seem to be doing really well in China in Auto and Industrial, but Consumer always seems to be a little bit of a challenge. Can you help us understand, is it a function of price points of brand, or focus is there -- when we think about the Consumer build out in China, there seems to be an opportunity for you guys, but I'm not sure your business is really that big in the grand scheme of things over there and doesn't seem to be growing up fast?\nInge Thulin: First of all, yes, we do well in China. We have good traction. And again, this quarter we had 7% growth, n fact 8% in the core business if you take out electronics. As I talked earlier, the way the evolution of businesses are going is stopping with Industrial, followed by Electronic and Energy, then Safety, then Consumer, finally Health Care. So Consumer part is a smaller portion in China, and so is actually Health Care as well. I think the answer to your question is that it's very much around brand awareness. And brand is in our mind, it's where we all grew up what we are used to, et cetera. So it takes longer time in order for you to build the awareness in those businesses. So we still see growth opportunities in China for Consumer, but in that specific market I would turn Health Care and Consumer around, and say, Health Care would get faster traction for us than Consumer. So I will say, I agree with you. I hope we will be bigger at this point in time. I hope we're being able to grow faster, that we will over time. So we have some very strong brands. It's just that it take time for us to get awareness and build out in the category, and we also very careful who we deal with in China relative to the channel partners. So I think, over the time it will be big. We'll grow faster. And we have to make sure that we get with that business good profitability for us as well, right. So we are not giving away things, and it's not only about market share, we need to make sure that we are investing in businesses where we get the good return. And there is some very good businesses for us in China to speak, as you know, both in specifically in Industrial -- specifically Industrial. One I can't talk about purification, it is growing fantastically. We've continued to invest in that. So I hope that will gave you a little bit of flavor why it's small.\nScott Davis: And then as a follow-up to that, I mean when you think about pricing going on getting 1% price in this type of a lower raw material environment and challenging macro in general, what is the interplay between price and volumes? I mean, did you give up some volume this quarter to get that price? It's hard to say with some of your markets you create the categories, so it seems like you should be able to get pretty good pricing power. But clearly, with the currency moves, I would imagine if you have some local competitors that might able to keep price a little bit lower for a while and take some share, what do you think about that?\nNicholas Gangestad: Scott, we don't see that we're giving up volumes in exchange for price. And it really comes back to 3M's business model of investing in innovation, having that strong new product flow. It gives us the ability to reflect the value that we're creating in the markets and for our customers. So it's something we're conscious of, we monitor. But right now, Scott, we're not seeing our stance on pricing, in light of the current cost raw materials as impacting our volumes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: On the topic of FX, Nick, maybe if you could help critique the effectiveness of the new hedging program, you extended the duration from 12 to 24 months, but how is that program working versus your expectations?\nNicholas Gangestad: For those that may not know what Deane is talking about, in the middle of 2014 we extended the tenure in our hedging programs to go out from our past policy of going out and hedging 12 months out to now hedge in addition to that 24 and 36 months out. And to answer your question it's going quite well, Deane. The true impacts of going out with the tenure in 24 and 36 months, that will manifest in 2016. And if you look at the amount of deferred gains that we have in our hedging program, that's reflective of that change in our hedging program.\nDeane Dray: And then a follow-up would be for Inge on the Polypore acquisition. And maybe if you could just take us through, and maybe this has a little bit of the boost that Ceradyne gave you, was where else will you apply ultrafiltration across 3M's businesses? And then within your answer, maybe what does ultrafiltration give you that CUNO did not?\nInge Thulin: First of all, as we not have closed on Polypore, I would not like to talk about that specifically, right. So we have to respect the regulatory approvals that we are waiting for. So I will not talk about that. But if you think about it broader relative to our filtration business, that is a huge opportunity for us. And I will look upon that and I will combine it, if you like to think about it in terms of our non-woven technologies combined with what we have in our purification business, and then some additional technologies that will be added later on. So if you think about a global mega trend that are related to both air pollution and clean water, that is where we will play big time with the platform, as we go ahead. So I will say that I am very encouraged actually relative to our current performance, both in purification and in personal safety that is around respiratory products. And we will build out those businesses as we go. So think about it as a good way of us to extend our technology capabilities in order to create more value in those spaces, which is both global mega trend, but also local mega trends. And as Scott and I talked about it earlier, relative to China, this is a huge opportunity, as we all know and everyone know that. But we need to be able to capitalize on it with technologies, because at the end of the day this is very much a regulatory business, and we need to make sure we have product that meet the standards.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein.\nSteven Winoker: Did you all see any volume de-stocking across your distribution in any of the business units? We've been hearing some short-term trends in some other companies on that front.\nInge Thulin: De-stocking or?\nSteven Winoker: De-stocking, yes?\nInge Thulin: I think that when you look upon it, I will not say, yes, bit time. But I suspect that all of us leading businesses, like we do at 3M and our customers, as some uncertainty came in Q1, as I said earlier, both relative to exports from U.S. based on the strength of the dollar and oil price. I think that most companies, generally speaking were very careful of how you build and manage your inventory in Q1. So I think I will be surprised, even if I don't have any facts in front of me, to say that people manage the inventory very tightly and as tight as they could in Q1, and so did we, by the way, right. So I think that's the answer.\nMatt Ginter: Maybe one comment in the Consumer business, which you'll see in one of the slides, our point of sale growth was good and it was higher than our actual growth. So there may have been a little bit of inventory takeout at the retail channel.\nSteven Winoker: And then, Matt, on the Consumer side, I think that was still the lowest growth since, like what, maybe the fourth quarter of '13. Was that related in any way?\nMatt Ginter: Yes. That was the point. The outdoor sales were actually better than that. So there is some adjustment there in the channel.\nSteven Winoker: And then just a follow-up question on pricing. You mentioned earlier that two-thirds of the 1% pricing increase was FX related and a-third roughly it was new product development and et cetera. So I'm just trying to get a sense, are you seeing pressure on pricing in that you think is currency driven in other markets from an export prospect from your competition. Is this something where people are trying to take advantage of it?\nNicholas Gangestad: Steve, that's something we're constantly on the lookout for as in the time volatile FX. So this is changing the competitive landscape for us. And at this point we are not seeing evidence of it changing our competitive landscape or our ability to price in manner similar than how we priced in the past in multiple geographies, including the United States.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS.\nShannon OCallaghan: Maybe just a follow-up on the tightly managing business in the first quarter, as you mentioned you're kind of doing that with inventories and others are as well with FX and oil uncertainty. Is that uncertainty now viewed is or do you view it as having lessened, given some stabilization I guess in the prices of oil and the currencies or such that you would manage those things less tightly in 2Q or how do you view that where we stand today?\nNicholas Gangestad: In terms of managing our spending tightly, I don't see that changing as the year goes on, particularly in markets like West Europe and United States, some of our developed markets, where we're managing our spending pretty carefully right now.\nInge Thulin: Yes, I would say that there will not be any change, as we move into Q2 relative to operation. The team here is on this big time. So there would no change short-term relative to what we need to do. And we had an aggressive plan for the year and we will do everything we can in order to make sure we deliver on that one.\nShannon OCallaghan: And then just in terms of how the first quarter progressed, we're getting sort of different stories from different companies about how the year kind of started and exited 1Q. Did you see any variation across the months of the quarter, either a slow start that improved or vice versa?\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes, that's something we're always looking at as if there is a change in trend. And as we look, as our revenue progressed through the quarter, we really did not see a meaningful trend one direction or the other throughout the quarter. They have one-off things occurring like when Chinese New Year is and when Easter is, when we adjust for those things, we really see no meaningful trend through the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.\nNigel Coe: So, Nick, just wanted to go back to the raw material commentary. I think you guided for $0.15, $0.25 benefit for the full year, back in December. And it looks like you have a $0.05 of benefit this quarter. So are we now looking at a situation where the raw material benefits are now above the $0.25, given your commentary that its more backend loaded in your plan?\nNicholas Gangestad: So in December we laid out a range of $0.15 to $0.25 that we were expecting for raw material commodity price benefits. On January 27 in our fourth quarter earnings call, we updated that, say, we now see ourselves at the high-end at $0.25. And Nigel, what we have been seeing is this is playing out almost exactly as we've expected. From a commodity pricing, we see it fairly balanced throughout the year. The only nuance on that is that there is some inventory channel work through of using slightly more expensive inventory to our channel, which is what makes it just a little bit less in the first quarter. But that's all progressing right to our $0.25 that I stated back in January.\nNigel Coe: And my math on benefits, on the 50 bps of benefits above $0.05, is that about right for the quarter?\nNicholas Gangestad: 50 bps would be about approaching -- \nMatt Ginter: I think it's about $0.04, Nigel. We'll get back to you.\nNigel Coe: And then secondly on the margin bridge, I just want to understand the mutual impact of FX, because we've seen that the hedge gains would have been a net benefit to margins. So I just want to understand why that's flat? And if possible, if you could call out, how much of the gain came through in 1Q?\nNicholas Gangestad: There is a couple of different forces their Nigel that in this quarter netted out to no change to the margin. There was the hedging gain, which is an absolute upside benefit to the margin. But that's offset by a differential to the margin, where we source things to the extent to which our international companies source product from a U.S. dollar currency. That has a negative impact on margins. Those two things offset each other in the first quarter of 2015. As we look out over the remaining three quarters of the year that will likely become slightly accretive to our margin. Very similar to what we saw in second quarter and then a little more accretive in third and fourth quarter.\nNigel Coe: Any ways you could quantify that mix?\nNicholas Gangestad: Excuse me, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Any way you can quantify that benefit?\nNicholas Gangestad: When I'm saying -- I am talking small, like 10 basis points, 20 basis points, 30 basis points. Just to put out a range on that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy of Stifel.\nRobert McCarthy: Just one quick question on, just any update on what you're seeing with ERP and the traction in terms of your investments?\nInge Thulin: It's going well. As you know, we are sort of updated you in December and even after that. We are rolling out as we speak now in Europe, in West Europe specifically, and the next place to go live is in Nordic. And we are rolling that out according to plan. And as you know, we went from go, when we tested it country-by-country, now to go regional and we go in West Europe first. And I think it's the first week of the -- or we go in July, second week in July, is when we will roll out in Nordic next. So everything is on plan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: On the hedging dynamics, I guess you can kind of do the math on that, I'm not sure whether it's in the 10-K or not or the 10-Q. But are you looking at for '16, if you know the euro stays where it is today. Is there an impact there or do you go all the way out through '16?\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes, Steve, we are hedged out through '16 and in fact a little into '17. And just to put the numbers on it for 2015 versus 2016, we're estimating approximately $175 million of hedged gains to our P&L in 2015. And if everything stayed right where it is, that would be followed by $110 million of hedge gains in 2016.\nSteve Tusa: Has anything changed with regards to how the four-Xs dropping through, exclusive of the hedges? I think Danaher today talked about a higher margin on there drop through.\nMatt Ginter: I guess what I'd say, Steve, is back to the couple of questions ago, the one we're hedging and the dollar is strong, net-net it should be slightly positive to margins, as Nick just alluded to, and that is our expectation for the year. So when we calculate that, when we calculate the impact, we take our numbers and pull out the sales impact from FX and the bottomline impact from FX, recount the margin; and if you're hedging, by definition, your margin should go up slightly.\nSteve Tusa: So one last question just on, so basically similar growth in the second quarter to the first quarter. Should we be, say -- I mean can growth get to in this kind of economy, this kind of outlook. Can growth get to like above 6% in the second half? I mean is that should we thinking about high end of the range type of growth in the second half of the year, I mean can it accelerate that much?\nInge Thulin: Well, we do not change our guidance for the year at this point in time. So you have 3% to 6%. So I think you're describing correct. As I said earlier, think about it very similar to Q2 as Q1, and then we will see an acceleration in the last part of the year, second half. And then I would not predict at this point in time how high it will go, all right, because we are not immune to the economical environment and how that will accelerate. But our performance of 1.5x to 1.7x IPI is steady, as I said historically, when I look at on those six months periods, as you and I have talked about earlier, so I'm optimistic 3% to 6% for the year.\nSteve Tusa: And then just one last question. Are you guys seeing any impact from competitors, global competitors, given the foreign exchange movements? I think of your products is pretty defendable with good modes, but anybody getting regressive out there on price?\nInge Thulin: Well, we have all type of competitors, right. We have global competitors. We have regional competitors. We have local competitors. So we are working with this the whole time. And I would say, as Nick said earlier, up to this point in time we have not seen any change in the behaviors versus what we see the whole time when we do business on the day-to-day basis, so answer to that no. But of course, we have competitors, right. And they are everywhere and they are very attractive, of course, to come into spaces where we are, because nice growth and nice good margin, but we have not seen any change in their behaviors up to this point in time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.\nJeff Sprague: Just a couple, really quick one. Just back on FX, I would imagine those hedges are in a handful of major currencies. My question is if you -- maybe that's right or wrong, but the larger question is if you think about that $110 million hedge gain that you have for 2016, does that fully cover kind of the topline driven FX headwind you would expect in '16, if we just run through at these rates for the rest of this year and into next year.\nNicholas Gangestad: Jeff, couple of questions there to go through. One is it's largely in developed markets and those currencies that we're able to cost effectively hedge. So currencies like the euro, the Canadian dollar, the yen, the Australian dollar, those are examples where we do the majority of our hedging. Other currencies such as Brazilian real, that's less cost effective for us to hedge in and in markets and currencies like that, our approach is to rely more on natural hedges, meaning how much do we source locally, our ability price to offset some of the FX movement, our ability to manage our cost structure in those places. Those are part of 3M's playbook on managing FX in more developing markets. To your question on does this fully cover the currency exposure going into 2016, no it doesn't. It's never our intense with our hedging strategy, our financial hedging strategy to offset all of the risk. We offset a portion of it to help minimize reduce volatility and we also do it to buy time for us to adjust our business models accordingly. So it doesn't negate all of the risk in 2016, but it buys us more time and take some of the volatility off the table.\nJeff Sprague: And I'm just wondering on strategic investments, is there any change in tempo over the course of the remainder of the year?\nInge Thulin: No, there's not. I mean, we are working our plan and we're couple our years into it, as you know. So there's no change in the tempo relative to our ERP program or investment in recession development and what we call I3 or any small restructure as we do in here or there when we have the opportunity to do it. So the plan from that perspective is working and it's working well for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.\nLaurence Alexander: Two quick ones. Can you characterize how you see the setup for the year in European auto? Some companies have talked about that as being most likely area for Korean [ph] chute in terms of domestic activity. And secondly are there any regions or end-markets where as you look at the sequential trends into March and April, the deceleration was sharply worse than you expected?\nInge Thulin: Well, on the European front, first of all, our automotive business globally is doing very well. I mean we have 9% growth in the quarter versus 1% growth in the auto build. So again, we are doing very, very well. And that's a global business, so we do well with all the global players. Relative to Europe, we have good penetration on design and spec-in there, as all other places. And you could assume that, who knows that in the later part of the year the export generally speaking for West Europe will improve, due to the dollar versus euro and other currency. And by then by definition automotive will capitalized from that as well. So assuming that that is correct, as everyone talk about, then there will be a improved export from Europe generally speaking. Automotive by definition is a big engine for growth in West Europe as we all know. Now, many of the automotive makers here designing and spec-in on certain places and they could use it to other parts of the world. But many of them in Europe are exporting quite a bit outside of West Europe in terms of the manufacturing. To your second quarter, no, I will not say there was any change with more than, which is a small piece is Middle East/Africa. Middle East/Africa, as we all know and understand due to geopolitical issues face challenges, so I would say that was not in March. I think that was for the whole first quarter was total different environment to do business. And so I think that's the only place that we could see any change in trends, right. So that's understandable in way and you we have to manage it through the situation.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments. End of Q&A\nMatt Ginter: This is Matt. It's obviously a very busy earnings day, so we really do appreciate you spending the hour with us. Thank you very much. We look forward to speaking to you very soon.

I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2016 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com under the heading, quarterly earnings. Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our investor events in 2017, as highlighted on Slide 2. First, starting with earnings, this year\u2019s conference calls will be held on April 25, July 25, and October 24. Second, we will be hosting a European Investor meeting on June 6 and 7 at our Headquarters in Neuss, Germany. Please hold the dates, additional information will be provided closer to the event. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to Slide 4 and I'll handoff to Inge. Inge?\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will begin my remarks with a recap of the fourth quarter and later in the call, I will provide some comments on our full-year performance. Our team had a good finish to 2016 as we delivered double-digits growth in earnings per share along with strong margins and a robust cash flow. We also continued to position 3M for the future through our three key levers while returning significant cash to our shareholders. With respect to EPS, we posted earnings of $1.88 per share, an increase of more than 13% year-over-year. Total sales across our enterprise was $7.3 billion, up slightly versus last year's Q4. Organic growth companywide was 2% with three of our five business groups delivering positive organic growth. As I indicated in our October earnings call, organic growth in Industrial turned positive in the fourth quarter. This business had a strong finish to the year with 5% organic growth, which was broad-based across the portfolio. Safety and Graphics posted 2% organic growth with a good performance from personal safety, one of our Heartland businesses, as well as from roofing granules. As we expected, organic growth in Health Care was similar to the third quarter at 1.3%. We expect Health Care to regain its momentum as we move further into 2017 and as our additional growth investments begin to pay off. Organic growth in Consumer was down 1%, while this business experienced positive point of sales across its retail customers, it was negatively impacted by inventory reductions throughout the retail industry. Electronics and Energy closed out the year with another quarter of sequential improvement posting organic growth that was down just slightly, while once again expanding its operating margins. Looking at margins across our entire Company, we delivered another strong broad-based performance. Margins were up more than 200 basis points to nearly 23% ranging from 30% in Health Care to 21% in Safety and Graphics. At the same time, we generated healthy cash flow with the free cash flow conversion rate of 154%. Our strong and consistent cash flow enables us to invest in the business, while also return significant cash to our shareholders. And in the fourth quarter, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In summary, we had a good finish to 2016 and I would now turn the call over to Nick, who will take you through the details. Nick?\nNicholas Gangestad: Thank you, Inge. Let's begin with Slide 5, where I will breakdown the fourth quarter change in sales. Organic local currency sales grew 1.6% in the quarter with organic volume up 1.5% and selling prices up 0.1%. Divestitures reduced sales by 0.4 percentage points. This impact relates to the divestitures of non-strategic businesses further evidence of our ongoing portfolio prioritization and focus on our best opportunities. Finally, foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.8 percentage points. Considering all factors, fourth quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 0.4% versus last year. On a geographic basis, U.S. organic growth increased 1.2% led by a mid single-digit performance in Industrial. Health Care and Safety and Graphics businesses also grew organically in Q4. Turning to Asia-Pacific, organic growth was up 2.4% with Health Care and Consumer leading the way. This growth was partially offset by a decline in Electronics and Energy during the quarter. Within Asia-Pacific, organic growth increased 6% in China/Hong Kong and 3% in Japan. Excluding our Electronics businesses, China/Hong Kong was up 11%, and Japan grew 2% organically. EMEA organic growth declined 2.4%. West Europe was down 1% as growth in Safety and Graphics and Industrial was more than offset by declines in our other business groups. Central East Europe and Middle East Africa declined mid-single digits year-on-year, impacted by ongoing challenges in Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which we expect to persist in the near-term. Finally, Latin America/Canada was our fastest growing area with organic local currency growth of 4.1%. We saw solid growth in four of our five businesses led by high single-digit growth in Health Care. At a country level, Mexico delivered strong double-digit growth, while Canada was up 3%, and Brazil increased 1%. Please turn to Slide 6 for the fourth quarter P&L highlights. Companywide fourth quarter sales were $7.3 billion and we generated earnings of $1.88 per share, a Q4 record. GAAP operating margins were 22.7%, up 220 basis points year-on-year, which we delivered while making incremental strategic investments of $50 million to drive future sales and profit growth. On the right hand side of this slide, you\u2019ll see the components of our margin performance. Starting with the benefits, price in raw materials combined increased margins 50 basis points versus Q4 of 2015. Market prices for many raw materials were once again favorable year-on-year and our global sourcing team continues to deliver savings above market. Core price growth was down slightly in the quarter as we took targeted actions to drive organic volume growth. Moving to restructuring, you may recall that in the fourth quarter of 2015, we announced a restructuring plan to enhance our competitiveness and productivity. The associated benefit from this action boosted fourth quarter 2016 operating margins by 40 basis points year-on-year in addition to the positive comp related to the Q4 2015 charge itself. Pension and OPEB expense declined year-on-year, as has been the case throughout 2016. This increased Q4 margins by 90 basis points. Organic volume and utilization was neutral to margins in the quarter, a marked improvement versus the headwinds we experienced through the first three quarters of 2016. Improved organic volume growth was a factor in this improvement, particularly in our Industrial and Electronics and Energy businesses. Turning now to headwinds, foreign currency impacts net of hedge gains decreased margins by 20 basis points in Q4. Legal and other reduced margins by 30 basis points in the quarter primarily due to higher year-on-year costs from legal settlement. Incremental strategic investments lowered margins by 70 basis points in the quarter. As we indicated during our December outlook meeting, we are increasing investments in a number of core platforms to accelerate growth in 2017 and beyond. At the same time, we continue to take actions in Q4 to better optimize our global manufacturing footprint, improve service to our customers and drive ongoing productivity. Finally, well, you don't see it on this chart. Q4 corporate and unallocated costs were higher than anticipated, largely due to the aforementioned legal costs. For the full-year 2017, we anticipate corporate and unallocated costs will be in the range of $225 million to $275 million. Let's now turn to Slide 7 for a look at earnings per share. Fourth quarter GAAP earnings increased 13.3% to $1.88 per share. As you see a number of factors impacted our earnings, growth and margin expansion added $0.16 to per share earnings in the quarter. Acquisitions and divestitures increased earnings by $0.04 per share, driven by gains on the divestiture of the Polymask business within Industrial, along with the sale of non-core intellectual property in Electronics and Energy. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging reduced pretax earnings by $18 million or the equivalent of $0.02 per share. Higher balance sheet leverage led to an increase in net interest expense year-on-year reducing per share earnings by $0.02. Our fourth quarter and full-year tax rate came in lower than we had projected due to a combination of increased benefits from our supply chain centers of expertise, along with improved geographic profit mix. The Fourth quarter tax rate was 28.2% versus 29% in last year's fourth quarter, which increased earnings by$0.02 per share. Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined 2% year-over-year, which added $0.04 to fourth quarter EPS. Please turn to Slide 8 for a look at our cash flow performance. Fourth quarter operating cash flow was $2.2 billion. Free cash flow conversion was 154% in Q4 and 104% for the full-year. For the third consecutive year, free cash flow conversion exceeded 100%. In the fourth quarter, we invested $436 million in CapEx, bringing our full-year investment to $1.4 billion. For 2017, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Also in the fourth quarter, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders via dividends and gross share repurchases. For the full-year 2016, we returned $6.4 billion to shareholders, including cash dividends of $2.7 billion and gross share repurchases of $3.7 billion. For 2017, we expect gross share repurchases in the range of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion. Let's now review our Business Group performance starting with Industrial on Slide 9. Industrial posted Q4 sales of $2.5 billion leading the Company with organic growth of 4.6%. Our automotive OEM business led Industrial delivering strong double-digit growth continuing its consistent track record of outpacing growth in global car and light truck builds. Advanced Materials, Automotive Aftermarket and our Separation and Purification business all posted solid mid single-digit growth year-on-year. On a geographic basis, Industrial's organic growth was broad-based across all regions with mid single-digit growth in Latin America/Canada, the U.S. and Asia Pacific while EMEA was up low single-digits. The Industrial business delivered strong operating income of $553 million in the quarter with margins up 260 basis points to 21.9%. The margin improvement was driven by the gain on sale of Polymask, past restructuring actions and ongoing productivity improvements. Please turn to Slide 10. Safety and Graphics delivered another good quarter with fourth quarter sales up 2.2% organically to $1.3 billion. Our Personal Safety business posted solid mid single-digit organic growth in Q4. This included double-digit growth in China/Hong Kong, where we continue to experience strong end market demand for our personal safety solutions. The Roofing Granules business delivered another solid quarter of high single-digit growth which capped off a consistently strong year. On a geographic basis Safety and Graphics growth was led by Asia-Pacific and Latin America/Canada, which were up mid single-digits. You may recall in December, we announced the sale of our Identity Management business. We continue to expect the divestiture will be completed sometime during the first half of 2017. Safety and Graphics operating income was $270 million in the quarter and operating margins decreased 100 basis points to 20.8%. Adjusting for the divestiture gains and restructuring charges that occurred in Q4 of 2015, operating margins increased 120 basis points year-on-year. Please turn to Slide 11. Our Health Care business generated fourth quarter sales of $1.4 billion. Organic growth was up 1.3% in line with our expectations. Health Care growth was led by a double-digit increase in food safety, followed by solid growth in both drug delivery systems and medical consumables. Organic growth in oral care was down slightly as the business continued to be impacted by soft and market conditions and channel inventory adjustments. Health information systems also declined organically year-on-year due to a slower rate of software installations in a tougher market over the past year, along with the challenging comp against last year's record Q4. Looking ahead, our customer pipeline is strong. Therefore, we expect growth in health information systems to accelerate throughout 2017. On a geographic basis, Health Care delivered high single-digit growth in Asia-Pacific with particular strength in China/Hong Kong, which was up double-digits. Latin America/Canada and the U.S. also posted positive organic growth in the quarter. Health Care\u2019s operating income was $410 million and margins remained strong at 29.8%. Importantly, we generated these returns while investing an additional $30 million to enhance growth in core platforms across the business. Next, let's cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 12. Fourth quarter sales for Electronics and Energy were $1.2 billion, down 0.6% organically. Organic sales growth was flat in our electronics related businesses an improvement over recent quarters as end market conditions and channel inventories became more stable. As we explained at our outlook meeting in December, we are gaining penetration with leading electronics OEMs in China and also investing to capitalize on the rapid growth in automotive electronics. Our Energy related businesses declined 2% organically with growth in our telecom business more than offset by declines in electrical markets and renewable energy. As a reminder, at the end of 2015, we exited our backsheet business in renewable energy, which reduced energy related organic sales by 3.5% in Q4 of 2016. On a geographic basis, sales in Latin America/Canada grew organically in the low single-digits, while Asia-Pacific and EMEA declined. Electronics and Energy delivered a strong operational quarter with operating income of $326 million and margins of 26.9%, up 10.3 percentage points year-on-year. The year-on-year improvement was driven by a few factors that impacted Q4 margins in both 2015 and 2016. First in Q4 of 2015, we incurred charges related to portfolio and restructuring actions, which reduced fourth quarter 2015 margins by 340 basis points. Second, in the fourth quarter of 2016, the business realized a gain from divesting non-core intellectual property, which added 270 basis points to Q4 2016 margins. Adjusting for these items, Q4 margins increased year-on-year by approximately 400 basis points. Looking at the full-year operating margins were 22.3%, up 120 basis points year-on-year. I'll finish with our Consumer business on Slide 13. Fourth quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion. And as Inge mentioned, growth was impacted by channel inventory reductions in the U.S. and to a lesser extent West Europe. So from a pure selling perspective, our fourth quarter organic growth was down 0.7%. On the other hand from a point of sale or sellout perspective, our Q4 growth was positive in the in line with our historical trends. So we expect consumers organic growth will be back to more normal historical levels during the first quarter. Despite these channel adjustments, we posted positive worldwide organic growth in three of our four businesses, namely Home Improvement, Consumer, Health Care and Home Care. The Stationery and Office Supply business, which was most impacted by channel adjustments declined year-on-year. Looking at Consumer geographically, growth was led by a mid single-digit increase in Asia-Pacific, while the U.S. was flat, and EMEA declined year-on-year. Consumers operating income was $228 million with operating margins of 20.9%. Margins were down year-on-year for two primary reasons. One, we rationalized one of our manufacturing sites during the quarter, and two, the business accelerated growth investments in the quarter. We continue to see good opportunities to invest and drive growth within the portfolio. In fact, we increased investments in Q4 in our category-leading Command and Filtrete product lines. Both posted double-digit organic growth in the U.S. this past holiday season. That wraps up our review of fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 14 and I'll hand it back over to Inge for some final comments before Q&A. Inge?\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Nick. The fourth quarter kept a successful year for our enterprise, as we executed a playbook and delivered a strong operational performance. We increased our earnings per share by 8%. Margins were up more than 100 basis points to 24% with four of our five business groups posting margin expansion. In addition, we delivered free cash flow conversion of 104%, which is our third consecutive year above 100%. And for the fourth straight year, our return on invested capital was above 20% coming in at 23% this year and we achieved all of this in a year of flat growth. As you can see, we are executing well and controlling what we can control. 2016 was also a notable year with respect to our dividend, as we marked 3M\u2019s 100 consecutive year or paying dividends to our shareholders. For the full-year, when we combine dividends and share repurchases, we returned a total of $6.4 billion to our shareholders. During financial results, we continue to build for the future through our three key levers, which are significant value creators for us. Let me start with portfolio management and ongoing process that is all about strengthening and focusing our portfolio, which improves our competitiveness and make us more relevant to all customers. This includes consolidations within 3M, along with divestiture of non-core businesses, and we were active in both fronts in 2016. Portfolio management is benefiting our customers and 3M as we now have greater scale and are able to better prioritize our resources. This includes growth investments and at our December outlook meeting, we highlighted incremental $100 million we are investing to accelerate growth in our core platforms. We will now move on to the second lever, investing in innovation. In 2016, we invested $1.7 billion or nearly 6% of sales in Research and Development, which is the heartbeat of our Company. This supports both our short and long-term growth objectives and along with our premium margins a return on invested capital. Last year, we also celebrated opening of a new laboratory in St. Paul, while earning more than 3,000 patents around the world. Business transformation is the third lever, which starts and ends with our customers. Last year, we will continue to make good progress with the rollout of our ERP system in West Europe, which is nearly complete. Within West Europe, we have now deployed in 11 countries our four largest distribution centers and our supply chain center of expertise. Globally, we now have a total of 16 countries live and a new ERP system and our three global service centers are also up and running. We are already beginning to realize productivity gains from business transformation, which will increase in 2017 and beyond. By 2020, it will result in $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings and another $0.5 billion reduction in working capital. Looking upon our performance in 2016, the 3M playbook is working. From an operational perspective, we are executing well and delivering premium returns. At the same time, we continue to make investment that would enable us to capitalize as growth conditions improve. As a result, we are positioned to build on our momentum and deliver another strong performance in 2017. Please turn to Slide 15. Here you see our planning estimates for the year, which are unchanged from December outlook meeting. We estimate earnings per share in the range of $8.45 to $8.80 and increase of 4% to 8%. Organic growth is expected to be 1% to 3% and we anticipate another good cash flow performance with a conversion rate of 95% to 105%. With that, I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Scott.\nNicholas Gangestad: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Davis: When I look at my list of companies at least, you guys tend to be, obviously, about as global as anybody gets and have a pretty broad supply chain. And my question is how do you plan spending on even 2017? I mean how do you plan spending when you don't have a real great sense of tariffs and trade and how all that could be disrupted in the next couple of years? Does that play into the planning at all or do you just continue on?\nInge Thulin: Hi, good morning by the way.\nScott Davis: Good morning.\nInge Thulin: As you know, we are laying out very much localization strategy in terms of our business well all subsidiaries around the world. So at this point in time, we continue to lay out the plan as we have talked about. We are making investment in what we see the most important businesses for us to grow both in the United States and overseas based on that strategy, right. So by definition, even if we have both the global customers and local customers, we need to make the investment based on what they are and what they are going. And I would say that when I look upon this quarter specifically, there is some very interesting movements, I think coming back a little bit to historic performance relative to growth, which we had that 1% growth in developed markets, but we are 3% in developing markets. So there is type of a movement going also coming back in the developing economies, which is interesting. And as you heard Nick said, if you take China, China was 6% organic local currency growth all in excluding electronics was 11 and when look upon our five businesses in China specifically it was fantastic growth all of them. We have Safety and Graphics grew almost 20%, Consumer 17%, Health Care 15% and Industrial 12%. So we need to continue to invest based on the growth in those segments. So we don't make a change at this point in time relative to the planning for the year and as we said in December, we are adding another $100 million this year in order to accelerate commercialization of products. But I would say generally speaking, it's early in the year as we know, but I saw some trends here that our positive relative to growth coming. You saw Industrial business group almost 5% growth and it was broad-based all over the world. They grew in every geographical area around the world. So very encouraging as I look upon it. For Germany, they have positive growth for the third consecutive quarter for us. So I feel more positive as we move into 2017 even if it's early.\nScott Davis: Just a quick follow-up when you guys think about - I\u2019ve never asked this question before, I don't know why I haven't, but is there such a thing is book-to-bill in Electronics and Energy or is it too short cycle for that?\nInge Thulin: Once again, can you repeat the question?\nScott Davis: Sure, is there such a thing is like a book-to-bill or something like that Electronics and Energy where you can get a sense of which quarter of this year coming up, you turn into positive territory? I don\u2019t know again why I\u2019ve never asked that question before, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever referenced it. Just trying to get a sense of which quarter you might see positive growth and that would\u2026?\nNicholas Gangestad: Scott, let me take that one. We don't have a formal metric that we're measuring on a book-to-bill ratio in our Electronics business. It is a fairly short cycle, we're working with all of our customers there to be projecting, what the demands are in the future, but unlike some other industries, this is not one where we have a book-to-bill ratio.\nScott Davis: Okay. That's what I thought, but I have to ask. Thank you guys, and good luck to you.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nNicholas Gangestad: Thanks Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: Good morning. Just a question firstly on the Consumer business, I don't recall you talking about the slowdown much at the mid-December meeting. So I wondered if it was something, the inventory reduction was something that became apparent sort of very late on? Is there any color you could give around days or weeks of excess inventory in those channels today?\nInge Thulin: Julian as far as the consumer business in the trends we saw throughout the fourth quarter much of this differential we saw between sell in and sell out occurred in December and in particular in the last half of December. In regards to inventory, we don't really see the channel is having excess inventory now. We considered a fairly normal inventory channel level in our consumer channels.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks. And then if we look at the margin bridge, it was curious a little bit that the utilization piece and organic volume was not a contributor. It was flat even though the sales growth performance was actually pretty good. Was there anything unusual in Q4 that weighed on that specific line in margins that meant the operating leverage was not as high as it could or should have been?\nInge Thulin: Yes, Julian that's and I'll just put it in perspective, we've had that particular item being noticeably negative on our margin for the first three quarters of this year and getting that to be neutral for us for the fourth quarter with our 1.5% volume that's the main thing that happened for us in the fourth quarter. There isn't some particular headwind buried in there, but it was for us a notable trend change from where we've been the first three quarters.\nJulian Mitchell: And do you still feel good about $0.10 to $0.20 of EPS accretion in 2017 from utilization.\nInge Thulin: Yes, we do Julian. That component of our EPS lock as well as every other line, we're still feeling very confident in right now Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning guys.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Andrew.\nNicholas Gangestad: Good morning, Andy.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: So just a follow-up on Industrial, we know you have significant short-cycle exposure within Industrial and you did have easier comparisons in the quarter. But I think that growth jumped pretty meaningfully. Maybe you could give us some more color on how much of the improvement was maybe the energy component within advanced materials looking less bad or we know you had the big defense contract ramping up within advanced materials versus the rest of the Industrial business improving. And then how do you feel about your 1% to 3% growth forecast now for 2017, given you put up over 4% in 4Q?\nInge Thulin: Well, first of all it was broad-based growth in Industrial, both in terms of the businesses and in terms of the geographical area. So that was not one specific business that type stood out of in terms of growth, even if you saw a Nick comment on - again the fantastic performance for the automotive OEM business, but it was broad-based and it's coming back, I would say a little bit as we have talked about earlier in terms of evolution of economies. And I think you've seen now as becoming more output from manufacturing around the world, we are very early in that process. And if you look upon PMI, the United States had a PMI of 54.7% in the quarter, China 51.4%, and Germany 55.6%. If you think about that in terms of big economies that will help us as we move forward, and as I said, it was broad-based. Now to your second question, how we feel about 1% to 3% for the year as we came out of 5%? Feel good, feel good. Too early to change that as we sit here today, but generally speaking, I would say, feel good about Industrial businesses. And if you think about in terms of size, this is one-third of 3M and when we start to get good momentum in that business, that's helping us, a lot, right. You saw they had good growth and we talked about that on the last earnings call that they will grow in Q4 and they did and it's very good. But yes, I said that\u2019s too early to change anything as we move into the year, right, so let's see after first quarter how we position it.\nNicholas Gangestad: Hey, Andy just one more detail on that I'll share. We've been talking about this for a quarter or two that we have some defense contracts we were awarded and those shipments were going on in the fourth quarter. Our body armor shipments added about 150 basis points to the total Industrial organic growth in Q4, so stripping that out the core underline is right around 300 basis points of growth.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Okay, Nick, that's helpful. And then, Nick, you've talked about 3M's ability to achieve 30 to 50 basis points [of pressures] across in 2017. You obviously did 50 basis points in 4Q. But pricing in the U.S. continues to look competitive. It was a bit worse in 4Q than it was in 3Q. You mentioned sort of going after some additional organic growth. Can you talk about 3M's ability to offset a pretty competitive U.S. pricing environment? With the better sourcing and with the help of business transformation that you talked about are you still confident in positive price versus cost contributing to that $0.20 to $0.50 of organic global currency growth that you have?\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes. Andy there is a lot of subjects you hit there in one question. As far as the underlying price growth in the U.S., what we see in our view is our fundamental pricing power is not changing. It's still very strong. We did in the case of the U.S. take some targeted actions to help drive organic volume growth for us. Also for the total Company and this isn't going outside the U.S. This is a quarter where we saw less pricing actions related to FX movements and you see that with our - and that's down noticeably from where we've been in the first three quarters of this year. So all in for 2017, we're still expecting the positive core price growth in the U.S. and globally. Now to the other parts of it, our ability to use sourcing to continue to add to our earnings into our margin. I laid out a month ago that we expect between $0.10 and $0.15 of EPS accretion through our sourcing effort and everything we're seeing now, we see that on track, much of that is being driven not by just pure market prices, but it's now being driven by our own efforts to be substituting raw materials and taking advantage of our negotiation power.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Thanks, Nick.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nNicholas Gangestad: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Congrats on the 100 years of paying a consecutive dividend; not a lot of companies can claim that. The first question I have is on Health Care. You talked a little bit about regaining momentum, and I recognize that you had some product introductions in the quarter, but you also still have some headwinds on Oral Care. And I'm just curious, given the headwinds also potentially from the ACA, I'm just wondering like what gives you kind of the confidence that you could really see the momentum pick up as we progress through 2017?\nInge Thulin: Well, first of all most of our businesses are doing very well, right. So food safety is still growing very well, drug delivery system did well as well and then consumables in medical space did well. So if you take that together, right, there is underlying momentum in the business. We have invested quite a bit in this business for some time and we stepped that up and they have had a big investment starting already second half of 2016 and that now we'll start to generate growth coming into Q2 and Q3 for the year. And the pipeline as Nick comment on, the pipeline for health information system is very strong, so yes, it\u2019ll slow down a little bit in terms of execution and deployment of that software into the hospitals, but the pipeline is very, very strong. So I would say that when you think about it generally speaking, we know that with investment in the areas we invest in Health Care, which around coverage, is around health economics and that's about some research and development, specifically the coverage will pay off rather sooner or than later. And again we see that the developing economies are starting to pick up for us. So the confidence is high that we will see the growth coming as we move into 2017.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. And then maybe my follow-up question and getting back to price cost for a second. Nick, maybe talk a little bit about the fact - it looks like you got about 10 basis points or so on pricing this quarter. We're moving into more of a kind of a commodity reflating environment. So how is that dynamic going to work as we progress through 2017 on your ability to continue to get price?\nNicholas Gangestad: Joe the total posted 10 basis points if we strip out the FX portion of that and then we're looking at flat to down very slightly of core underlying there. As I look at how this progresses throughout the year, we actually have a pretty steady view throughout the year Joe, if it changing much of just much of just having our core underlying price growth often in that 30 basis points to 50 basis points. I think the wild card on there is FX, the dollar been moving a lot and that as far as what we post for price growth in the quarters will be volatile in the coming quarters with some volatility based on what happens with the U.S. dollar primarily in developing markets.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. Got you. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Winoker: Thanks and good morning all.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Steve.\nNicholas Gangestad: Good morning, Steve.\nSteven Winoker: Just back to the pricing questions, specifically, you mentioned targeted actions that you took in the U.S. to drive some volume? Can you give us a little more color on what segments you were talking about, what areas?\nInge Thulin: Yes, Steve, it\u2019s in particularly isolated places, there is some places in our consumer business, where we took actions like that also in our Industrial business. Those are the most common places where we took those types of targeted actions Steve.\nSteven Winoker: Okay. And with the trigger for that kind of thing, competitive actions was it particular projects I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of the implications for the broader pricing power in those businesses?\nInge Thulin: Steve, we take those actions when we see an opportunity either in the competitive landscape to take share that we otherwise want to have or in some cases it's a reaction to where we see pricing pressure from competitors and we price accordingly to maintain some other shares, so it's some of those Steve.\nSteven Winoker: Okay. And then just a more specific question on E&E. Can you just give a little more sense in display materials systems, how much was OLED impact to this quarter and what the other kind of impact besides OLED was?\nInge Thulin: The OLED impact or just to put it in perspective, last December when Jim Bauman was laying out the OLED impact that we felt that would have on 2017 sales, we put a range between $50 million and $150 million of impact. We saw a number impact for total year 2016 right in the middle of that range and for the fourth quarter I would call it very similar to that of $20 million to $30 million range of impact on our total revenue. Steve that's the OLED impact on what we're seeing in the Electronics and Energy business.\nSteven Winoker: Okay. And any major offsets to that?\nInge Thulin: Yes. As I mentioned, we are targeting to be increasing our penetration in some of the OEMs in China, electronics OEMs in China and we're seeing some success there. We're also targeting growth in automotive electronics and we're also seeing some successes there as well.\nSteven Winoker: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Inch: Thanks everyone. Good morning.\nInge Thulin: Hey, John.\nJohn Inch: Hey Nick, hi Inge. How did the Dental business do sequentially? I don't remember you talking about that when you were describing the puts and takes in the Health Care performance. And it was under pressure, right in the third quarter? Did you see a similar trend in the fourth quarter?\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes. John, we saw our Oral Care down slightly, partly from softening end user demand and also what we see is continue channel contractions in the Oral Care business.\nJohn Inch: Do you have any sense of the underlying - it's one thing if it's one quarter, because sometimes dental, it seems is a little bit of a canary in the coal mine, right, for the economy. But now the economy, based on your own commentary and what other companies are saying, seem to be picking up. So what do you attribute then, I suppose the continuation of the soft dental? Is there a way you could frame what you've seen and maybe provide some historical context?\nInge Thulin: Yes. I think what you saw in the last quarter of the year, basically the two things is inventory reduction in the channel, because it's very much distribution-oriented and that's based on lower demand in the end market. And I think that was based-based relative to United States and West Europe. Now, if you think about both in consumer and you think about the business like Oral Care, the supply chain there is very sophisticated. So what we have to look upon is sell-in and sell-out, and I think in those cases, what you will see as demand will by definition should go up and I think the facts are telling us that in that industry in Oral Care then they would build up inventory, again, as you go into the year. But for us, we look upon those businesses, they are very good partners of ours and they are very professional very, very professional in the supply chain, so they do the right thing in terms of adjusting their level of inventory if they see a softness. What they are telling us now is they see demand coming back as you roll into 2017. If you move from Oral Care and go back and I was not sure that came across. If you take our consumer business that was down 1% in terms of sell-in from us, sell-out on our top customers in U.S. was 3%. So in 3% that's the historical base for consumer for the last couple of years. So from that perspective, I think the retail channel stay, so maybe some softness for them, generally speaking in the end of the holiday season they did the right, they just managed through their inventory and for me that's a very professional way of doing business. Our sell-out was the same indicating for me as we move into 2017 that inventories will be filled back because the demand will steady in the end market, but I think they did the right thing in terms of the retail channels.\nJohn Inch: Well, I certainly give away your products as Christmas gifts, so don\u2019t let me\u2026\nInge Thulin: We can do more.\nJohn Inch: Yes, bigger gift bags. Just as a follow-up, you mentioned divesting non-core IP in the Electronics and Energy business. Nick or Inge, could you expand on this? What exactly is this and do you have like this reserve of IP that in theory, you could keep divesting to take gains? Or was this a one-off event or just a little more context on what ultimately happened in that segment please?\nNicholas Gangestad: John, I think this is much more of a one-off. There was a particular set of IP that we had developed and we're using years ago, we reached a point where we felt we no longer needed it for our own business and we were licensing that IP, we chose in the fourth quarter to sell that IP and our relationship with that that particular IP we had in Electronics and Energy. To your question, is it a broad thing that we have a stable of these we\u2019re ready to go with? The short answer is no.\nJohn Inch: Okay. And then when you say it wasn't core, is there anything you'd say about the IP you sold? What was it for or is it pertaining to anything you downsized or something?\nNicholas Gangestad: No, it's something related to our electronic materials solutions division and that's about as deep as I'll go with that, but it really is not related to anything we divested.\nJohn Inch: Got it. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert McCarthy: Good morning, everyone.\nInge Thulin: Good morning.\nRobert McCarthy: I guess the first question is in terms of just thinking about your overall explicit exposure to energy and kind of the wider implications and [knock down] effects of your portfolio to energy, given what we've seen in the downturn, have you seen any encouraging trends across your businesses that you would cite to say with the stabilization in energy prices, you could start to see incremental growth in the back half of this year? Could you just comment about what you're seeing across your portfolio with respect to that?\nInge Thulin: Yes. I think first of all the answer is yes, we should see an uptick in the end of 2017 in the energy space and we have a very strong solid business in two utilities, right. That's a core 3M business and in fact this is a Heartland division. That division will do well. What they have is they have an element of some project-based businesses and we had talked earlier about ACCR and there is some pipe coating as well that had a type of a negative effect in terms of comparison for 2016 and should benefit that business as you move into 2017. The other business that we had a good quarter here is actually communication, what you will call telecommunication, but communication had a good quarter for us with 10% growth. It\u2019s a smaller business for us, but we did well. So I think the energy space for us should improve as we move into 2017.\nRobert McCarthy: How do we think about the offsets in association with just kind of price cost and raws in the context of that though?\nNicholas Gangestad: Rob, as we contemplate where we see our raw material pricing going in 2017, we took a view of oil in the range of somewhere between $50 and $60 a barrel and that's why we're seeing diminished impact from market prices on our commodities benefiting us in 2017 versus what we've seen in 2015 and 2016. So we\u2019re anticipating that in taking that into account. Most of our raw material or commodity benefits we\u2019re seeing are going to be the result of 3M efforts we're doing to take cost or substituting lower commodities. So there is an offset there and we think we\u2019ve pretty accurately taken the offset on both the revenue side and the cost side into account.\nRobert McCarthy: One final one, obviously, I don't think you provide or disclose where your CapEx is spent explicitly, although, obviously, anecdotally you do. But just looking at kind of the typical Note 17 in your 10-Ks, you can kind of see a flavor of where your PP&E is. It's disproportionate in the U.S. unsurprisingly, and obviously, the PP&E has been growing reasonably well in the U.S. while it's been relatively flat, I would say, across the balance of the portfolio. But could you comment on explicitly your CapEx kind of strategy for the U.S., any kind of metrics you could use? And really the spirit of the question is obviously with the prospect of a change in the tax law in association with the deduction of capital expenditures in the U.S. potentially, that's the nature of what I'm asking about.\nNicholas Gangestad: Rob, as you look at our total CapEx, we spent $1.4 billion on CapEx in 2016, a little more than half of that was spent in the United States, and it goes into a number of things, Rob. It goes into some of our business transformation investments; it goes into maintaining our capital base. Of all the areas of the world, the U.S. we have a very well developed capital base of manufacturing sites and investing in CapEx to maintain that, also some expansion in the United States that we've been investing in, so a little over half of it. It's around the world though Rob, we are investing in capital as Inge as started out this morning and talking about we're investing in capital to align with where our customers are and aligning demand. So where we've been in the last few years, we've seen a little less international demand and a little higher U.S. demand and that has impacted our capital allocation. And going forward, we still anticipate a significant amount of our capital, for the next year or two; I won\u2019t be surprised that it's going to maintain being over 50% in the U.S.\nRobert McCarthy: Thanks for your time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Yes. Just of the investment spending picked up this quarter relative to 3Q, so just wondering if you can be a bit more granular in terms of where you're spending. And in particular, you referred to some price actions to drive volumes particularly in the U.S. Would that fall under investment spending?\nNicholas Gangestad: I'll take the last part of that first Nigel that the changes in pricing that I talked about that would not be part of investment spending. What is included in our strategic investment spending that we called out that's impacting our margin by 70 basis points this quarter, theirs is two components. One is us taking actions on addressing our manufacturing supply chain footprint that we laid out last March at our five-year outlook meeting. We\u2019ve been taking actions and that is part of what occurred in the fourth quarter, but also what's in that is investments we're making in growth in core platforms within 3M and that was part of what we\u2019ll also laid out in December. In 2017, we are accelerating our investments of approximately $100 million in these core growth platforms. We started that investment in the fourth quarter of 2016 and that makes up a little over half of the total of that strategic investment that we laid out for fourth quarter in our margin.\nNigel Coe: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks Nick. And then a follow-on question on FX. We have seen a fair amount of divergence in the [indiscernible], RMB weaker, the real stronger. How is that impacting the translation impact? How is that impacting your margins? And the spirit of the question is, my understanding is that your EMs are generally higher margin than DMs. Is that still the case and is there any significant margin impact from translation of the currency movements?\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes. Nigel, what I've seen over time and what I'm seeing this quarter and into the futures it's less impacted by that particular mix, how it impacts our margin more dramatically is actually our hedging and sometimes it becomes counter intuitive Nigel that when the dollar - when we start to have the dollar stronger and negative impacts on our earnings per share from a stronger dollar. We can add for a period of time to see higher margins as our hedging gains step in and boost that margin. We have lower sales dollars from the translation, but higher margins. That's been a more impactful factor on overall margins we post and the mix of where the currencies are strengthening or weakening against the U.S. dollar.\nNigel Coe: Right. Okay, I'll follow up offline. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Good morning, guys.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Shannon.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Hey. So at 1.6% I mean you're already kind of getting close to the mid-point of the organic guide for the year and you've got Health Care clearly way below what you would normally expect to be at and Consumer is negative. It seems like you feel pretty good about Industrial continuing to be strong. So are there any other offsets here? Because it would seem that you'd be tracking closer to the higher end of that organic guide, all else equal, unless there's something you expect to slow.\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes. For 2017 Shannon, the 1% to 3% we\u2019re still right there. Yes, we like the fact where we ended in Q4 from an organic growth. But it's also in line with what we were anticipating in total, and it's in line with where we felt we needed to be for the 1% to 3% that we guided for 2017.\nInge Thulin: We would like to go ahead of our self right. So I think it's important just to make important as we roll into the year and see more evidence of the positive movement, we saw here in the end. But as you said, investment we are doing the initiative we have around growth right because you look upon 3M as you see it now the efficiency in this organization is incredible and you see what we do in terms of EPS growth, free cash flow conversion, return on invested capital. We can get growth up even more that will get very good return for all of us. So that\u2019s why we focus in and make sure that we will execute on that, but we will not over promise anything to you at this point in time.\nShannon O'Callaghan: Thanks. And then just on Mexico, I mean you talked about - I think you said double-digit growth there again this quarter. 3M has always been good at monitoring and managing through different global risk areas. I mean what's your current view there? Are you seeing any change in activity and do you do any kind of scenario planning around your position there in particular?\nInge Thulin: No, we don't, we have had very have strong growth in Mexico for quite sometime and it is an important local market for us, right. We have been there for many, many years. In Latin America, we have a very good growth rate for this quarter and we have been in that part of the world with our domestic business since 1946, right that we start operation in Brazil 1946. We have huge operations and it's very much locally driven and that is our strategy. So 10% growth in Mexico growth in the quarter is a good result, Brazil had 1%, so look like they're coming back a little bit, but we are not changing anything as I said - as I start the call here. Our strategies around localization and if you go back to what we have talk about, we never left United States. We expanded international based on the local market opportunity, right. So I think that's how you should view 3M in the business model that we are using?\nShannon O'Callaghan: Okay. Thanks.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeffrey Sprague: Just a couple things, a lot of ground covered here. First, Nick, I was just wondering, back on the December guide, although the broad strokes have not changed, are you within the range of all those individual kind of bucket items that you gave us, [down through] pension, tax, et cetera, et cetera?\nInge Thulin: Jeff, yes. The short answer is, yes. A couple I\u2019ll just put on the - I'll explain. Pension I'd originally guided $0.00 to $0.10 headwind now that we have that all locked in that will be an 8% headwind for the year. And then tax rate since it ended a little lower, we\u2019re still seeing at a 28% to 29% tax rate in 2017. Back in December, I was saying I expected to be a little bit of a tailwind probably would be more neutral on for us for 2017 right now.\nJeffrey Sprague: Okay, and also this is for Nick, could you just update us on your stranded cash, probably all your cash is outside the U.S. or some 90%. But do you cap the break near-term on share repurchase? Waiting to see if we get some kind of repatriation or something, or do you kind of proceed as normal on the borrowing and repurchase tempo you've been on??\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes, our total cash Jeff is we have just a little over $2 billion of cash outside the United States. It's not a large number. I'm sure you're aware of this Jeff. We've been going to a number of efforts to be optimizing our global optimizing our global cash position and we've been managing that global cash balance down especially our international cash balance down. So our current capital allocation plan, we can execute that without any kind of tax reform or any kind of action. And it's really too early for me to comment on if something were to happen of what we do. We're obviously prepping and preparing and will act accordingly to take advantage of whatever kind of legislation occurs, but I think it's too early for me to comment on how that would change our capital allocation right now.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thanks, and just finally, if you wouldn't mind, any color that you could share on January? Has there been any kind of change in behavior as we slip into the New Year, particularly in shorter cycle Industrial markets in particular would be of interest?\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes, just as far as the year is starting, we're not seen any kind of change in the trajectory that we were anticipating. It's consistent with what we were expecting when we guided 1% to 3% and nothing really changing out of the norm for us, Jeff.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin: Yes, good morning.\nNicholas Gangestad: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: I will ask Jeff's question in a slightly different way about what you're seeing. Inge, I think you said that there are reasons to get excited, and I was wondering if you could share any anecdotes, obviously, without changing the guidance, that makes you more excited.\nInge Thulin: Yes. As I said earlier, when you look upon it in terms of our performance for this quarter and the momentum you have seen after some time where there has been slower growth right, but if you start to look upon elements that look positive for you. For me that will be like we had a good quarter in United States, right. United States grew 5% in the quarter. Japan grew 2% and China grew 11% excluding electronic. Electronic was 6% and we have had three consecutive quarters in Germany with growth. If I look upon that and I think about big economies in the world United States, Germany, Japan and China on a positive movement forward I feel better about it. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m overly excited because overall you also have some tempering in Central East Europe and Middle East/Africa and that will hold for some time. But I would say that that's what I see. I saw our Industrial business have a good growth and then I take those geographical pieces together. Safety and Graphics continue to have a solid performance. Health Care, I'm convinced it will come back for us. And then as I said earlier Consumer when you look upon sale in and sail out, it's not the concern. But I think if you take for all of us, the bigger picture of growth coming in the two biggest economies in the world and then you add Germany and Japan to that, if you are 3M, which is about technology conversion and demographic shift. They look slightly better today than it is six to nine months ago.\nAndrew Obin: Let me just ask a follow-up question. One of your competitors highlighted that they're seeing a meaningful, positive impact from the change in one child policy in China. What are you guys seeing in Health Care and Consumer in China? Can you identify it and does it provide any potential upside to your thinking for the second half of the year?\nInge Thulin: It should by definition and if you look upon those two businesses for us in China specifically, we had 17% growth for Consumer in the quarter; we have 15% growth in Health Care for the quarter and that's a positive outcome and those business even if they are small for us, if you look upon our portfolio in China, the two biggest in size for us is Electronics and Energy, and Industrial right because of the evolution of that economy. But what will come is Consumer and Health Care. So when you\u2019re running them at 15% to 17% that's a good signal for us. We have a huge penetration opportunity there and they are both local domestic markets right, so no export by definition.\nAndrew Obin: And you have the capacity to meet this demand?\nInge Thulin: Absolutely.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you very much.\nNicholas Gangestad: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Tusa: Hi guys, thanks for going over the hour to fit some of us in. I appreciate it.\nInge Thulin: Hi, good morning, Steve.\nStephen Tusa: Lots of questions asked just on the forward look here into the early part of the year. The Street has you guys APS kind of flat year-over-year, but normal seasonality from the fourth quarter, if we adjust some of these gains et cetera out, gets you to something that's a little bit higher than that in the 210-ish range. Is there anything unusual about the year-over-year comp that we should be keeping in mind for the first quarter? Maybe just a little bit of color, I know that the Street basically has you guys flat, but they have you growing for the year. So do the trends out of the fourth quarter change that view to make you feel a little bit better about being able to grow earnings here in the first quarter?\nInge Thulin: Steve for the quarters of 2017, I would call this remarkably stable year of nothing particular to call out quarter-by-quarter to be thinking about the only thing on the margin - on the hedge that I'd say is strategic investments that I talked about earlier that we started in Q4. Those will be more heavily weighted in the first part of the year. In fact I expect strategic investments in first quarter to be very similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter.\nStephen Tusa: Okay, so you expect to grow earnings in every quarter essentially?\nInge Thulin: I think Steve you're trying to turn me into a quarterly guided here, for the year we\u2019re\u2026\nStephen Tusa: It\u2019s pretty vague question.\nInge Thulin: Yes, I'll just leave it. We don't see a lot differentiation of the core underline business quarter-to-quarter.\nStephen Tusa: Okay. So when you guys talk about strategic investment that's I would assume outside of R&D because R&D as a percentage of sales was I think down a little bit in the quarter that stuff that is not considered just R&D I would assume?\nInge Thulin: A very little of our strategic investments if any is R&D. This is really about commercialized for the growth side of it. It's really about investments we're making and commercializing what we already have.\nStephen Tusa: Okay, super. Thanks a lot.\nInge Thulin: And Steve, just one more point, I\u2019m going to repeat a point from December. Growth we expect to be largely aligned for the year across most of our business the one exception is Health Care. I just want to remind you, we expect Health Care growth to accelerate growth to accelerate as the year goes on.\nStephen Tusa: Great, thank you.\nInge Thulin: Okay. Thanks Steve,\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over Inge Thulin for some closing comments.\nInge Thulin: Thank you. To wrap up, the fourth quarter completed a successful year for our enterprise. In 2016 we executed our playbook and post strong financial results in terms of EPS and margins along with free cash flow and return on invested capital. At the same, we continue to simplify organization and improve our cost structure while making investments for the future. As a result, we are positioned for a strong 2017 and we'll capitalize as growth conditions improve. Thank you for joining us this morning and have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentleman that does conclude the conference call for today, we thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line."}, {"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 3, "year": 2016, "date": "2016-10-25 15:19:15", "content": "Executives: Bruce Jermeland - 3M Co.

Welcome to the 3M Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, October 25, 2016. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland - 3M Co.: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2016 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com under the heading, quarterly earnings. Before we begin, I would like to address our upcoming investor events, highlighted on slide number two. First, we have set the dates for our 2017 quarterly earnings calls. They are January 24, April 25, July 25, and October 24. Second, we'll be hosting our 2017 outlook meeting on the morning of Tuesday, December 13 at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Midtown Manhattan. Invitations for this event will be sent this afternoon, so please RSVP as soon as possible. We hope to see you there. Finally, next June we will be hosting a European Investor Day at our Germany headquarters in Neuss. A welcome reception will be held the evening of June 6, followed by management presentations and a plant tour on June 7. Please hold the dates. Additional information will be provided closer to the event. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide three. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1a of our most recent form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to slide four and I'll hand off to Inge.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, our company delivered increased earnings, robust cash flow, and a broad-based margin performance with each of our business groups posting margins greater than 22%. At the same time, we continued to execute on business transformation, took actions to strengthen the portfolio, and increased investment in future growth. The third quarter also marked our company's 100th straight year of paying dividends, which we increased for each of the last 58 years. With respect to EPS, our team posted earnings of $2.15 per share, up 5% year-on-year. We delivered total sales of $7.7 billion, flat versus last year's third quarter. Organic growth was down 80 basis points while the combined impact from acquisitions and FX increased sales by a similar amount. Looking closer at our organic growth, we once again delivered positive growth from three business groups: Consumer, Safety & Graphics, and Health Care. Consumer paced our company's growth at 3% with positive growth in all businesses. Safety & Graphics grew 2% organically, led by roofing granules and commercial solutions. Organic growth in our Health Care business was 1.5%, which was tempered versus recent quarters due to some softness in the U.S. healthcare market. Industrial's organic growth declined 1%, and we continue to anticipate growth in this business to turn positive in the fourth quarter. Finally, Electronics & Energy was down 8% in the quarter, in line with what we indicated during our last earnings call. Even in a challenging macro environment, the strength of our business model is enabled us to deliver premium returns and generate healthy cash flow. Company-wide, we increased margins 40 basis points to nearly 25%, ranging from 32% in Health Care to just shy of 23% in Industrial. At the same time, we increased free cash flow by 19% year-over-year with a conversion rate of 117%. Our strong cash flow allow us to invest in the business while also returning cash to shareholders. And in the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also continue to build our enterprise for the future, and I will make some comments on our recent progress. Please move to slide five. You have heard me talk many times about the 3M playbook, which is the key enabler for our short and long-term success. The playbook includes three levels that are creating value for enterprise and that we continue to make good progress on. Two of the levers, investing in innovation and portfolio management, are important to our long-term growth objectives. In addition to ongoing investment in research and development, we continue to prioritize our portfolio and make targeted investments to support organic growth. We also drive growth through acquisitions which complement organic growth and enhance our technology capabilities as well as partnerships which combine our strengths with those of other organizations. Most recently, we finalized an acquisition and established one partnership, both related to Health Care. You will recall that in February, we decided to retain and further invest in our health information system business. To bolster our technology capabilities in that area, in September, we acquired Semfinder, a medical coding company based in Switzerland. This acquisition helps us accelerate penetration in international markets, which is important as more countries move towards electronic medical records. To further strengthen health information systems, earlier this month we announced a collaboration with Verily, the life science business of the Alphabet Company. This is a partnership between two highly creative and innovative companies that will leverage our expertise in healthcare coding with their expertise in data analytics and software. Ultimately, we will develop tools to help providers increase the quality and affordability of healthcare, which comes back to our company's vision of advancing every company, enhancing every home, and improving every life. Beyond growth investments, we are taking other recent actions to prepare 3M for the future. Three weeks ago, we finalized the sale of a non-core protective films business that will further enhance and focus our Industrial portfolio. We're also making solid progress on our third lever, business transformation, with two recent ERP rollouts in West Europe. As a reminder, we have now deployed ERP in 15 countries and in four of our largest European distribution centers. In summary, I'm pleased with our team's performance in the quarter in terms of controlling what we can control while also building for the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Nick who will take you through the details. Nick?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Thank you, Inge, and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide six for a recap of our Q3 sales performance. Organic local currency sales declined 80 basis points in the third quarter, with volumes down 1.4% and selling prices up 0.6%. Our acquisitions of Capital Safety and Membrana net of three small divestitures added 0.3 percentage points to sales. And foreign currency translation increased sales by 0.5%. In U.S. dollar terms, worldwide sales were flat versus the third quarter of last year. Looking at organic growth by geography, the United States declined 0.3% in Q3. Our Consumer and Safety & Graphics businesses generated positive organic growth, which offset declines in Industrial and Electronics & Energy. In Asia-Pacific, organic growth was down 2.2%. Solid growth from our Consumer, Health Care and Safety & Graphics businesses was more than offset by a double-digit decline in Electronics & Energy. Organic growth increased 1% in Japan and declined 2% in China/Hong Kong. Excluding electronics-related businesses, Japan was up 1% and China/Hong Kong grew more than 4%. Let's now take a look at the EMEA region starting with West Europe. West Europe delivered 1% organic growth, led by Germany, Sweden, and Spain. From a business perspective, growth was led by Health Care and Safety & Graphics. Central East Europe and Middle East/Africa declined year-on-year, impacted by ongoing challenges in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. In total, organic growth across EMEA declined 1% in the quarter. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada was 1.2%. Mexico grew 5% and Brazil rose 2% while Canada declined 3%. Please turn to slide seven for the third quarter P&L highlights. Third quarter sales were $7.7 billion, and we generated record third quarter earnings of $2.15 per share. GAAP operating margins were again strong at 24.7%, up 40 basis points year-on-year. The combination of lower raw materials and higher selling prices contributed 100 basis points to our margin improvement, while lower pension and OPEB expense increased margins by another 90 basis points. Productivity gains related to last year's Q4 restructuring, expanded margins by 40 basis points in Q3. Looking at headwinds, first year acquisitions reduced margins 10 basis points. This includes the impact of Capital Safety and Membrana. We continued to accelerate strategic growth investments across the portfolio and took actions to further optimize our manufacturing footprint, which reduced margins by 40 basis points. The impact of lower year-on-year foreign currency hedge gains decreased margins by 50 basis points. And finally, organic volume declines along with related utilization impacts reduced margins by 90 basis points. Most impacted were our Industrial and Electronics & Energy businesses. Let's now turn to slide eight for a look at EPS. Earnings per share in the third quarter were $2.15, an increase of 4.9% versus the third quarter of 2015. Margin expansion net of organic sales declines added $0.05 to earnings per share in Q3. Foreign currency impacts, net of lower year-on-year hedge gains, reduced pre-tax earnings by $20 million or the equivalent of $0.02 a share. The third quarter tax rate was 28.5% versus 29.6% in last year's comparable quarter, which increased earnings by $0.03 per share. Favorable developments on international tax audits had a positive impact on the Q3 rate. And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 2% year-on-year, which added $0.04 to third quarter EPS. Please turn to slide nine for a look at our cash flow performance. We generated $1.9 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, a $244 million increase year-over-year. Lower cash taxes drove the increase, offset in part by higher year-on-year pension contributions. Q3 CapEx investments were $347 million, in line with last year's third quarter. And we now expect full-year CapEx in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. Third quarter free cash flow conversion was 117%, up 16 percentage points versus the same period last year. And for the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%. As a reminder, our fourth quarter conversion is typically the strongest of the year. In addition to investing in our businesses, we returned significant cash to shareholders in Q3, including $670 million in dividends, up $35 million year-on-year. We also returned $774 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases or $2.8 billion year to date. We now expect our full- year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion versus a prior range of $4 billion to $6 billion. Let's now review each of our business groups starting on slide 10. Our Industrial business posted sales of $2.6 billion in the third quarter, with an organic growth decline of 1.1% year-on-year. Our automotive OEM business grew high single digits again this quarter, continuing its long track record of increasing market penetration and outpacing the rate of global car and light truck builds. We also posted positive organic growth in our Automotive Aftermarket business. Advanced Materials declined double-digits year-on-year, impacted by persistent weakness in the oil and gas market. Looking by geography, Industrial's positive organic growth in Asia-Pacific was more than offset by declines in Latin America and the U.S. Third quarter organic growth in our U.S. Industrial business improved slightly versus the first half of 2016, and we expect to see further improvement in Q4. The Membrana acquisition, net of one small divestiture, added 1.4% to industrial sales growth in the quarter. Membrana continues to exceed our sales and profit expectations. Finally, our Industrial business delivered operating income of $591 million in Q3, and margins were up 30 basis points to 22.9%. Please turn to slide 11. Third quarter sales in Safety & Graphics were $1.4 billion, with organic growth of 2%. Q3 organic growth was led by our roofing granules and commercial solutions businesses. Roofing granules posted another strong double-digit increase in the third quarter. Demand in this market has been strong throughout 2016. On a geographic basis, organic growth in Safety & Graphics was led by Latin America/Canada which increased mid-single digits, followed by positive growth in Asia-Pacific and the U.S. Operating income was $364 million, and operating margins were once again strong at 25.1%, up 220 basis points year-over-year. Q3 margin expansion was boosted by lower year-over-year acquisition costs related to Capital Safety and solid productivity efforts across the portfolio. Please turn to slide 12. Our Health Care business delivered sales of $1.4 billion in the quarter. Organic growth was up 1.5%, led by a double-digit increase in food safety along with positive contributions from drug delivery systems, critical and chronic care, and health information systems. Organic growth in oral care solutions was flat, which was impacted by soft market conditions in the U.S. On a geographic basis, Health Care delivered mid-single-digit growth in Asia-Pacific. Latin America/ Canada and EMEA both posted low single-digit growth while the U.S. was flat. Organic growth was up low single digits in developing countries, a bit softer than recent quarters. Health Care organic growth in Q3 was below recent trends, and we expect soft market conditions to persist in the near term. Health Care's operating income was $429 million and margins remain strong at 31.5%. Importantly, we generated these returns while continuing to increase growth investments across the business. Next, I'll cover Electronics & Energy on slide 13. Third quarter sales in Electronics & Energy were $1.3 billion, down 8.1% organically. Organic sales declined 8% in our electronics-related businesses. Market challenges persisted across most consumer electronics applications, which impacted volume growth. Channel inventory levels have improved versus earlier in the year, but further adjustments occurred in Q3. Our team continues to focus on driving spec-ing wins and increasing customer relevance across all consumer electronics OEMs. Our energy-related businesses declined 9% organically. Electrical markets declined high single digits, and Renewable Energy was down double digits. As a reminder, we exited our Renewable Energy backsheet business last December, which reduced energy-related organic growth by nearly 300 basis points in the third quarter. Our third quarter operating income for Electronics & Energy was $312 million. And even in a challenging growth environment, our team delivered healthy margins of 24.2%. Please turn to slide 14 where I will cover our Consumer business. Consumer had another strong quarter with sales of $1.2 billion and organic growth of 2.9%, which led the company. Geographically, Consumer's organic growth was led by Asia-Pacific and the U.S., both up mid-single digits, along with solid growth in Latin America/Canada. Looking by business, organic growth was positive across the entire consumer portfolio, paced by a mid-single digit increase in our home improvement business. Within home improvement, our Command mounting projects, ScotchBlue Painter's Tape and Filtrete filters once again posted strong organic growth. We continue to accelerate growth investments to enhance the value of these important brands. Consumer-generated operating income of $317 million, with margins of 26.2%, up 100 basis points year-on-year. Positive organic growth, portfolio prioritization and ongoing productivity efforts drove the margin improvement. Please turn to slide 15 for an update on our 2016 planning estimates. We now expect 2016 GAAP earnings in the range of $8.15 to $8.20 per share versus a prior range of $8.15 to $8.30. The narrowed range equates to approximately 8% EPS growth year-over-year. Full-year organic sales growth is now expected to be approximately flat, at the low end of our previous range of flat to up 1%. Foreign currency translation is now anticipated to reduce sales by approximately 1% versus a prior range of down 1% to 2%. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, will add 1% to full-year sales growth. The full-year tax rate is now expected to be approximately 29% versus a prior range of 29% to 29.5%. Lastly, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105% for the full year. With that, we thank you for your attention and we'll now take your questions.\nOperator: Please limit your participation to one question and one follow-up. One moment, please, while we compile the Q&A roster. And our first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Joe.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Good morning, Joe\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So my first question I guess is going to be on healthcare. It's been such a great business for you guys for such a long period of time. And the growth we saw this quarter was about the slowest growth we've seen, I think, since 2009. And so to your comments from earlier that you expect the soft market conditions to persist, I'm just curious. What specifically slowed down this quarter in that business?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Well I think first of all, geographically, U.S. slowed down. And it slowed down basically in the last months of the quarter. And then I think there's two other elements out there in the world that happened to that business. Some, it's in developing economy where Brazil had a little bit of slowdown that was more than we expected. And then as you know, things are going on in Central East Europe, specifically in Turkey, that tempered it, generally speaking. So when you look upon it from a business perspective, if you tempered in United States which we did, that would go over all businesses. The U.S. I think tried to move some purchases forward maybe one to two quarter. That's what we're talking about, like mid-term or short-term tempering. So I would say all businesses except one, which is oral care, had positive organic local currency growth. And oral care was flat, so still showed growth but it was tempered. And by definition, I'm not concerned at all relative to the future of that business. And we continue to invest for the future. We've done quite some investment, as you know, the last couple of years. So there's no concern. Was just that it slowed down and it was basically in the last months of the quarter.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. That's helpful color. And I guess the \u2013 just following on, on the kind of soft market conditions to persist comment. Does that mean we should be expecting 1% to 2% type growth in this business moving forward? Or how are you guys thinking about that?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: No, no. We don't \u2013 no, we don't change the guidance relative to that business moving forward at all. I think you should think about it, for the fourth quarter this year will maybe be very similar to the third quarter and then it will come back in the first quarter. I cannot tell you here and now \u2013 we cannot tell you here and now when in the first quarter that will come. It come early, mid or late in the quarter but it will come. So we don't change the guidance at all for this business moving forward into 2017.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. No, that's helpful. And maybe my follow-on question is on the buyback. I saw that you guys reduced the buyback guidance for the year. I think when we last spoke, we talked about if perhaps M&A was not going to come through that maybe we'd see a little bit more aggressive share repurchases in the second half of the year. And so I'm just curious, maybe talk a little bit about the M&A pipeline and just the reasons for the reduced buyback items. Thank you.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Well relative to the pipeline, it's still very good in terms of what we are looking upon in all businesses. And as I've said earlier, there's some prime target in terms of business groups there when \u2013 and if you think about it, with Industrial, one-third of the company, of course we have interest in that business. Health Care and Safety & Graphics continue also to be prime objectives for us, but the pipeline is very solid for all of the five business groups. So solid. As always we have a look upon it from a strategic perspective and then make sure that the valuation is acceptable for us. And Nick will make some comments here relative to buyback.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah, Joe. Yeah. As you've seen year to date, we've repurchased $2.8 billion of our stock. And in Q3, the market was trading at near all-time highs and you've heard me say this before, that one of the factors that influences our repurchase activity is relative value and price. And as you know, that's why we stepped up our activity earlier in the year in the first quarter. So over time, the pace of our repurchases is dependent on other demands on capital such as M&A along with the relative value of the stock. And those things are what's impacting us, now putting a guidance at $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion for the year.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks, guys.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, good morning, guys.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Andrew.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Good morning, Andy.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Nick, you've said publicly that you're cautiously optimistic that you can grow margin in 2017, but obviously your overall markets have been a bit weaker than you expected. As we get closer to 2017, do you still have confidence that you can grow margin? And how should we think about the contributions of the drivers of the margin expansion? Business transformation should be a more meaningful driver than this year. Price costs still help. Maybe mix helps, but obviously we know pension and FX is offset. So maybe any more color that you can give us as we're getting closer to 2017 here.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. Sure, Andy. As you can imagine, we're still working on our 2017 outlook. And on December 13, we'll provide more details on that at our outlook meeting. At a high level, Andy, we expect an external growth market to continue moving sideways in 2017. That's the overall external picture we're anticipating. From a business perspective, we do expect our Industrial and Electronics & Energy businesses to have improved growth rates in 2017 versus what we've been seeing in 2016. And then to part of your question on margins, Andy, we're still expecting price raw materials to be positive to earnings and to margins in 2017, probably at a lower level of contribution to margin enhancement than what we've seen in 2016. And then business transformation, I expect that to have a increased positive impact on our earnings per share and net margin in 2017. I think you've heard me say that we expected and we're realizing approximately $50 million of operating income benefit from business transformation in 2016. And that's part of our journey moving to $500 million to $700 million of savings by 2020. And I'd expect 2017 to be a continued progression on that path. That said, we are as you mentioned, we're going to have a couple headwinds. Pension is likely to be a headwind for us. If I were to take current rates where they are, I'm estimating this will be about a $150 million headwind for 3M in 2017. And FX will likely be a headwind for us, not so much based on movements in exchange rates, but the fact that we won't be repeating some of the hedging gains that we experienced in 2016. All in, those lower hedge gains will probably hurt our margins by about $100 million. So all in, Andy, that's the puts and takes of a preview of what I expect we'll be talking about in a month and a half.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, Nick. That's very helpful. Inge, maybe I can ask you about Industrial. You said the U.S. looked a little better, but overall it seems like Industrial, it didn't get as good as the comps got easier. Abrasives turned down again it looks like sequentially. You do have easier comps as you mentioned in 4Q and you expect growth. In advanced materials, I mean it should shift, especially as you've got this defense contract from last quarter. So should we resume low single-digit growth moving forward? And how confident are you of that in that business?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah, as you said, so it being U.S. that hold back Industrial during the last couple of quarters, it was better in Q3. So that's positive, and we will see positive growth for Industrial in Q4. And that will be driven exactly as you said relative to we start to deliver now on the body armor. And we see some uptick in some of the other businesses. But it's very much the comp that will be a driver for us in Q4 and as we go into Q1. I'm very confident in our Industrial business group relative to growth going forward. And the reason for that is we have worked now for quite some time, not only in Industrial, but in all business group in order to make sure that we get the portfolio that be relevant for us in order to serve our customers. We have seen during the last couple of years some heavy lifting going on in the portfolio work, not only in Electronics & Energy but in Safety & Graphics and in Industrial as well. So when I look upon it, we are moving the company to spaces and places where we are more relevant and that we can also capitalize on technology conversion, meaning also driving better margin for us. So in fact, we have fired some of our portfolios over the years. So and it takes some time as you go through that process. It's not like you start to shift your portfolio and you start to shift your infrastructure in the company and everything will come immediately. But I'm very positive that we, now we start to see Industrial turning the corner as we move forward. And we will see the first quarter happen here in Q4.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks, Inge. Appreciate it, guys.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line with Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nScott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Morning, Scott.\nScott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Want to get a sense, when I look at Electronics & Energy, you're going to anniversary the renewable energy exit that's 300 basis points. So pound for pound that means you're down 4.5%, not 7.5%. I mean do you have a sense of after that you start to get double easy comps, I guess, if you will. Is this a business that can turn actually positive in 2017 or just less negative? And I know your comment earlier is they would get better, but can we count on it not hurting us any more I guess is my question.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Good morning, Scott. I think first of all, you have to look upon that business in terms of the overall portfolio. So for this quarter, just to make a couple of comments, we did better in electronic than we thought, and it was slightly tough with energy. In the energy piece was some big project that was delayed, specifically in telecom and in utilities. So I think that's again coming back to uncertainty in the market. It was not much of a shift, but it was a little bit of a shift. All in, we were down 8%, exactly as we told you at the last earnings call. So I feel good about that piece. Going forward, as we have shift the portfolio there as well, we will as we go start to see some positive evolution relative to growth rate because we are moving to segments that are growing faster and where we are more relevant. So if you look upon it, it will be around automotive electrification, data centers, sustainability, chemistry and green automation. That will be a shift as you go relative to where you today can look upon \u2013 it's very much design and assembly. So we have a range in the five-year plan as you know of zero to 4. We are in the first year of that plan which is then down. So it will be still the low end of that range, but as we roll in here for the future we should start to see some more positive movements forward for us in terms of growth rate.\nScott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's very good. And then as a follow-up on M&A \u2013 and I know...\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: And the other thing though, Scott. You look upon the margins now in that business. That business is now running at almost \u2013 they're 24%. So if you think about that where we started. We started at 15% 16%. That's work not only of cost out and structure out; it's also the portfolio work that had been going on. So for me when I look upon that business \u2013 and I think for all businesses, we should be positioned to win in places where we are relevant and can capitalize on technologies that we drive productivity and efficiency for our customers and also margins for us. So I think 8% down, you would like to grow. But we're able now to as I've said earlier, even where we are tempered on top line, we are able to deliver based on our new model. And we couldn't have done that for you five, six years ago. If we were down 8%, it would be terrible on the margins, so I feel confident now with our model there. And now as we move forward, now we will start to see some positive growth.\nScott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I remember those days well.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah.\nScott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just a quick follow-up, guys. When you're looking at transactions \u2013 and I think in the past you've said you'd like to start to look at some things that are a little bit bigger. I mean what are the probabilities we see in a deals larger than Capital Safety over the next 12 months?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: That's a very good question. It's a very good question. I don't know. I cannot get a probability of that. But as I've said the portfolio is rich in terms of candidates. I'd rather do slightly bigger than smaller. As I said earlier, we have during the last couple of years stepped up our probability \u2013 or the output on what we have done. And by definition, in order for us to move the needle forward, they should more sizable than we did in the past. So I think I hold it for then. Then when the news are coming out, we'll look upon the size of them. But we are ready. I mean we are ready. We are ready. I think we're on a good position to do what we need to do in order to bolster growth with or without acquisition. Also organically, we're doing okay.\nScott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Good. Thank you for the answer.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, good morning.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. Just wondered first of all if you could give a little bit more color on the slowdown you saw in the EMEA region in recent months relative to Q2. I know you talked a little bit about Turkey had slowed. But did you see anything broader, anything in Western Europe, for example?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Well, yeah. So if you start first of all, of Central East Europe and Middle East Africa. So yeah, of course, we saw, due to the situation, we saw Turkey slow specifically. And I think there was some slowdown also in Saudi Arabia. But I think if you look upon that region in total, yes, it's a tough situation. It's a tough situation there, and I think we have just to wait out for the euro-political situation to be settled before you start to see some big growth coming back there. Impact on West Europe. We had a very good quarter last quarter in West Europe and pleased with the quarter this quarter as well. Slightly slower growth, but still Germany had 3% growth in the quarter coming on a quarter last quarter that was 6%. So you add them together because the \u2013 a quarter or year doesn't start and end with a date. So if you look upon that. You take the biggest economy in West Europe, Germany, 6% for 3%. Let's say they are growing now around 4% and the business transformation is helping them. So I think the biggest concern generally speaking will then be Central East Europe and Middle East Africa in terms of growth rate at this point in time. I visited \u2013 Nick as well Europe just a couple of weeks ago and there's good momentum in the market, very much driven by automotive, by the way. So if automotive is doing well, we are doing well as well. So \u2013 but you saw this time, good growth in Sweden; good growth in Spain; Germany 3%. It's better growth than United States.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Very helpful. Thanks. And then my follow-up question would be around electronics and within that on the OLED transition, specifically. I just wondered how you thought about your cost base on brightness enhancing film in light of that transition. And also I guess you've already started to see some impact from the OLED transition this year. Do you think that impact is significantly larger next year or pretty much steady in terms of transition rates?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. I think when you think about the cost, think about 3M as a company that are using multiple technology platforms. We have 46 technology platforms that is owned by the company, not one specific division or country. And then number two that we have manufacturing assets that can be used in multiple businesses. So \u2013 and as you can see now, the margin in that business, EEBG, as a business group, is on a very respectable level. So I would not be concerned on the cost side of the assets. On the technology transition, as I've said before, always when there is a technology transition, you can short term lose a little bit and then come back. I think it's important to know both in LED and OLED, we are providing solutions to those devices also that have OLED. It's slightly less but \u2013 than versus LED but we are still in that business and it's expanding in a way. I will say going into next year, I will look upon it may be similar to 2016 as we roll into the year. But we have worked on that for a long time. This is not a surprise for us. So that means that technologies is in the pipeline. And as I said, technology transition is always giving you either short-term up-tick immediately or you have to have a little bit of drag. But it will not be very, very long.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Richard Lennox-King - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Oh, good morning. This is Peter on for Steve.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Morning, Peter.\nPeter Richard Lennox-King - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I was hoping maybe we could talk through some of the core pricing dynamics a little bit. So sort of parsing out between how much pricing was to offset FX headwinds and how much was core sort of pricing increases. Because it looks like price in the U.S. was negative but in many regions with positive price, that those are the regions that had negative FX. If you could talk to that a little bit.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Of course, Peter. Yes. For the third quarter in total, we reported 60 basis points of price growth. And 30 basis points of that was related to pricing adjustments we make in relation to FX. So you can split that right down the middle. 30 of it is core underlying price growth and another 30 related to FX. And many of you have probably heard me say over time that stripping out FX that our core ability to price ranges between 30 and 50 basis points. So we saw third quarter as another consistent quarter in that trend. In regards to the U.S., we were down slightly in price. That's really consistent with where we've been for the total year in the U.S. with prices more or less flat. And there's selected businesses at any given time where we're choosing to raise price, some where we're choosing to lower price based on competition. And in the case of the U.S., there's been selected cases where we've adjusted our pricing in our strategies to gain market share.\nPeter Richard Lennox-King - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And maybe actually just sticking on the price or price raws. Earlier, I think it was Q3 you said you were expecting 100 basis points of benefit for this year. I know you've addressed next year. Is that still the range you're looking at?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yes. We're still expecting price raws to be adding approximately 100 basis points to our margin for total 2016. Very similar to what we saw in Q3 which was also 100 basis margin benefit.\nPeter Richard Lennox-King - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. That's great. And then just maybe last one on that, on the same point. How much \u2013 what was the split between price and raws in the quarter?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Of the 100 basis points of price raw materials, 70 basis points is coming from lower raw material prices. And that's really a combination of both. Some benefits we're seeing in commodity prices but increasingly reliance on our own sourcing teams' negotiations and productivity efforts. So that's 70 basis points. And the other 30 basis points from the price I talked about earlier.\nPeter Richard Lennox-King - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Right. Okay. Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Thanks very much, guys.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yes.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nShannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Morning, guys.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Morning, Shannon.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Morning, Shannon.\nShannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. On the Electronics & Energy margins being up at 24%, even on the down volumes, how should we think about that segment now? I mean you've got all the other segments sort of 22% or better. Comps are easing there. I mean should we now expect that, that kind of joins the rest of the group here at 22% or above on an annual basis?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: 22% for the EEBG? Is that what you ask or what?\nShannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah. Yeah. Electronics & Energy, I mean seasonally it's a little stronger here at 24%. But you've gotten every other segment up 22% and now you've changed the business model there. The volumes are easing. I mean is that kind of a reasonable entitlement view of where that segment should go?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. Shannon, we expect E&E's margin for the total year of 2016 to be about 20% operating income margin. And it remains one of the businesses that we continue to see overweight margin expansion capacity in the coming years. So we're certainly striving to get it up to the company average, and I think you'll see it overweight for margin expansion in the next couple years.\nShannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then just on this sort of temporary healthcare slowdown that you're seeing, just a little more color on what's driving that. I understand you think it's temporary and it's going to \u2013 you're confident in the future. But is it more channel inventories? Are there specific uncertainties that are driving a pullback? I mean it seemed like it was kind of broad-based.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah.\nShannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: In the U.S...\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. I think the reality of business is that it will be both. But it start by people holding back a little bit and then they work down the inventory. But it's not an inventory correction in any sort or shape or form. I think it is yes, that people have a little bit of uncertainty here in the quarter of how this will shake out and then they're ready to go again. So I think it's a normal reaction for anyone around the world when you're going into a period of uncertainty relative to, will there be any changes or policies as you move forward, et cetera. So I'm not too, honestly, I'm not concerned at all \u2013 as I said, and you like to see more growth there of course with the margins we have. But it's not overall concern at all.\nShannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Morning, John.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey \u2013 morning \u2013 Inge, I realize you have various industrial initiatives you're working on and you do have easier compares in the fourth quarter and obviously into next year. What about the markets, the broader U.S. industrial markets in which you serve? What do you see happening today in terms of the sequential trend? Is it getting better? Is it flat? Does the end of the quarter get a little softer as some companies experience? What did you see? Again, not your initiatives. I realize you've got initiatives that you're outperforming. But what are your markets industrially doing?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. Well as you saw, the U.S. IPI was negative 80 basis point in the quarter for Q4. So you think about that in terms of there's some negative thing there. But we see indications of positive movement in the industrial space relative to manufacturing. So we are not immune to the overall industry. And when you \u2013 at least what is projected now for the IPI in this was actually in Q3 was down 80 basis point in IPI output. For us, as we move ahead, we will see positive growth in Q4. And if you look into the year as we move ahead, Industrial is going for us over many, many segments if you like. Even into Safety & Graphics, in some pieces also in energy. And we see slightly, slightly positive movements in that total market segment as you move into next year.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. I'm sorry, Inge. What indications are you looking at where you say there's positive movement relative to manufacturing? You were talking about the macro. Is that sort of a customer commentary or is it about inventory? Or what exactly are these indications?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. I think it's both. It's like when you work with the customers, you get the indication of they start to see an uptick in order. I cannot comment on inventory. I don't think we have seen any change in inventory, to be honest. And I think it's a okay level at this point in time.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Switching to Electronics & Energy, could you size for us how big your businesses are that would have some sort of a \u2013 would touch in some manner LED or OLED? Like I mean just how big are these businesses? It's like $1 billion, $1.5 billion, something like that?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: John, our electronics business is $3 billion out of the Electronics & Energy business. The display material solutions division within electronics is about 60% of that total, $3 billion, so about $1.8 billion. So, and much of that is connected with LCD but not all of it.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Nick, and what do you believe is the mix today of LED in these applications versus O-L-E-D or OLED?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Well it depends, John, on device. Right now, mobile phones is the most significant device impacted between LCD and OLED. And we see that as approximately 30% OLED today in 2016 and about 70% still LCD.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And the rest are lower in the mix? Is that?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Right. For instance, television, still vast, vast majority LCD or LED. And tablets is a pretty small number there as well.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And then just lastly, is the collapse of the British pound actually helping you in terms of your position in Britain and Europe or is it a headwind? Because relative to, I realize that FX, like the hedging gains issue, I'm sort of excluding that just in the context of the pound's collapsed, euro's down. It's not down that much. So all else equal, is this a net positive or a negative for 3M? And maybe you could put it in a context for us.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: John, it's about as close to a net neutral as you can imagine outside of FX. But from a standpoint we make some things in UK that we export, we also import things to UK. So it's very close to net neutral. Just having the pound devalue, that of course has a negative impact, but I think you're asking more the underlying and we're not a gainer or a loser in that.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So you're fairly agnostic to the pound, like if the pound goes to parity, you're going to be really agnostic to that scenario.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: So from a pound perspective, if for a 5% move in the pound, that would be about a $0.015 negative impact on us, just taking the FX impact of our UK. It's about 3% of our total global business. So just to size it up, how the pound movement impacts our total earnings per share.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yes.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, we ask that you please limit your participation to one question and one follow-up. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, gents.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Morning, Nigel.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: First of all, Nick, helpful color on the 2017 puts and takes. I'm going to ask you to maybe comment on top line a little bit, because quite a few of your peer group companies are sort of starting to opine on 2017. And I'm wondering, you mentioned the macro sort of sideways which I think is probably in line with expectations. What sort of growth rates do you think 3M can generate in another flat year? And I'm asking in the context of a 3% organic consensus expectation for next year. Is 3% even in play here? Or any comments there would be helpful.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. Nigel, I'll have to ask you to wait until December 13 for more specific numbers on that. But directionally, my comments about the external economy continuing to go sideways, I think that's a fair representation about how we're planning right now. And then incrementally that we see better improved growth in both Industrial and Electronics & Energy. But the actual numbers, let's wait until December 13 to talk about those.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. No, it's worth a try I guess. And then on pricing, I was quite surprised to see Latin America/Canada still above 5% given that the currency movements are starting to level off year-over-year. So I'm wondering, is that more of an inflationary type of impact that we're seeing with our pricing? And therefore, would that be stickier going forward?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. Nigel, when I look at Latin America and our price growth there, yes. As we saw the real strengthen quite a bit in recent months, but we're still seeing high inflation in the economy in Brazil which is giving us the opportunity to be having price growth that's matching what's going on in the economy. So yes, it's much more around inflation than it is around FX right now.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So plus 5% you think is sustainable going forward?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Sustainable going forward, I probably wouldn't go that far to call that sustainable. A lot depends on what the inflation rate continues to be, and I think that will be influenced by what happens with FX rates in the coming quarters.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning.\nRobert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So I guess the first question I would have is, given the prospect for sideways growth, which isn't particularly surprising given the macro backdrop we've seen over the past couple of years, does that allow you to do anything differently in terms of your execution of global excellence or SKU rationalization in terms of picking up the pace anywhere? Or do you think it's just kind of steady-state? I mean, does the environment that's presented to you create more opportunities in general on structural restructuring, business transformation or cost take-out to accelerate some actions that you otherwise wouldn't take given the demand environment?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. Well, I think first of all, it's \u2013 I don't think we're in a situation that we were in 2008 or 2009 where really everyone was pushed to do extraordinary things in order to improve the operations because there was no choice. I think we are in a situation now where we can work a model of do it when we can versus when we must, and I think that's an important differentiation to think about it. And everything we are doing now with the type of centralization, if you like, even if it's on a regional base, will help us a lot. And we are, yes, marching forward on that, marching forward in order to make sure that we build an organization for the future for 3M that both can grow and is becoming even more effective relative to operational excellence in the company. So we will go as fast as we can, but we are not taking any risks relative to be able to serve our customers. I think that's the important element. We are here to deliver to you what you expect, but we're also here of course to deliver to our customers. So I think you have this balance always when you implement new initiatives that you would like to go fast, but you have to make sure that you really understand the implication with the customers. So I think that's the answer to your question, that I and the team here, we are pushing as hard as we can to come as fast as possible to the most effective model, but you have always to think about customer first when you make those changes. But by definition, when you think about what we do in West Europe now, in terms of our inventories and so forth, yeah, of course it will be less SKUs because you consolidate inventories at fewer places et cetera. And that will roll out, and I'm sure that you have heard, and I know you have relative to our footprint initiatives that is, both in terms of manufacturing sites and in terms of distribution centers. So the answer is we are going as fast as we can, but we are not jeopardizing our service level to the customers.\nRobert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you for that, and just one brief follow-up. I guess in terms of the growth for sideways for 2017, it is what it is and we're going to get more color on that on the December 13 Analyst Day. However, are there \u2013 going in terms of the setup for your portfolio right now and kind of dovetailing the comments you made in your prepared remarks, are there certain segments that you think you can significantly outgrow the end markets that present themselves through product introductions? Is there a set of cards that you like with respect to your portfolio, specifically to 2017 or 2018 where you think you have capability for significant outgrowth?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. Well, you know, if you think about our business model, we have a proven model that we are able to outgrow IPI and/or GDP by 1.5x IPI or GDP. That is of course not happening every year, so but if you look upon it for 10 years, we have been able to do that. With all initiatives that we have taken in the company relative to the portfolio, relative to improved commercialization processes, et cetera, we should be able to do slightly better than that as we move ahead. I don't make a distinction in between certain segments that some will outperform more than others. We should be able to outperform at least 1.5x, maybe 1.7x as we move ahead in every segment we compete in because that is the expectation. That's why we are there. If we don't do that, we are not relevant in that segment to our customers, and then we have to do something different. So the other comment I would like to make is we cannot predict when a turnaround is coming in the economy. We cannot predict that. I don't think anyone can. One thing I would like you to know, we are ready. We are ready with everything we have done the last couple of years in terms of the portfolio, terms of the structure, in terms of stepping up the investment in research and development from 5.5% closer to 6% and the supply chain model, enabled by business transformation that all start and end with the customers. We are ready. So when it comes, we are ready in the forefront to capitalize on that.\nRobert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your time.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey just a quick question from me \u2013 and Nick regarding the lower tax rate this quarter you mentioned a favorable audit. But did you also repatriate as much cash as you had talked about last quarter?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. Deane, we've \u2013 as you know, we typically set a repatriation plan at the beginning of the year. We sometimes modify that if anything \u2013 well, it's gone up slightly of what we're repatriating from what our plans were at the beginning of the year. So it's eked up a little but not significantly, Deane.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. And then just to clarify, and I might have missed this, on the strategic investments in the quarter, the manufacturing restructuring. What segments were those addressing and do you plan to do more there?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. The strategic investments that we had in the third quarter, some of them touch multiple businesses including Health Care and Industrial in the third quarter. And in total, we're still expecting that we're going to accelerate that pace throughout the year in 2016. It's been ramping up each quarter. I'm highly confident the fourth quarter will be the highest quarter for strategic investments for 3M for 2016 and pretty close to being in line to what I originally guided last December.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. Thank you.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you, Deane.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nLaurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Just a quick one. Can you peel back a little bit what you're seeing in China in terms of end markets or your business lines which are getting better versus worse and how you're thinking about competitive pressure in the wake of ongoing SOE reform?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. Hi. Good morning, Laurence. Yeah. Well first of all, if you take our operation in China, we, ex-Electronic, we have 4% organic local currency growth in the quarter. If you take in Electronics into it which actually was down 11%, we were down 2 percentage for China. Now, if there is a clear improvement is what I will consider domestic-driven businesses. So if you take the five business groups for us in China, SGBG grew 18%, Consumer 12%, Health Care 8%, and Industrial 2%. And then Electronic & Energy was down. But if you think about that, we had four or five business groups in China growing. And it was very much in consumer healthcare, automotive aftermarket, automotive OEM, and personal safety. So I think that what we have talked about for quite some time about, so it's not really a shift to try to grow out the domestic businesses. It's coming but on the other hand it's a little bit slower we think versus the original plan. But if you think about that whole business; if you take the electronic part which is very much in Asia and in China, we had a 4% growth in China. You will like it to be 12% but it's 4%, and it's the biggest subsidiary outside of United States for us. So I am slightly positive as we move ahead relative to China. Now, that theme is driving productivity big-time. The model there today versus five years ago is different. Everything was about growth. We grew 15% to 20% year-over-year. We don't any longer. We grow 4%, so now productivity is a key element for us and I think that's important. We have good margins and we continue to expand margin there. So I hope that helps in terms of explaining China.\nLaurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: And just competitive pressure in any areas where you're seeing any real shift that matters?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: No, I think you have over year seen more domestic businesses or companies type of stepping up and I would say in all honesty, some segments which is maybe more commoditized, it could be a challenge. And for us, as you know, we work very much with technology conversion and with brand equity, so it's less impact for us. But of course there is this competition and I would say I would more relate that maybe to local companies that try to build coming into the market. Mostly, I would say in commodity-related businesses, meaning it's a price game, it's not a performance game and you have to ask yourself at the end of the day if you are 3M would you like to play in that area? Because as I said, in EEBG I'd rather fire some SKUs if I don't make money and have lower growth but better margin.\nLaurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in at the end here.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Steve.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Hi. Good morning.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning. So I didn't quite get the answer on electronics for next year, you said it's going to be better but does that mean growth?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah, Steve, I'm going to leave it just as we expect it to be better. We'll talk more in December 13 of what we see for the total growth range for Electronics & Energy in 2017.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. That's fair. What's going on in Health Care? 1.5% comp was a little bit lighter than I expected. Anything particular than tough comp to last year? Is it the Health Information Systems business that's maybe seeing a bit of hiccup after the strategic evaluation? What \u2013 would you point to anything in Health Care we should be watching over the next couple quarters?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: No. As I said earlier on the call, it's basically United States the type of temper itself for the quarter, so I wouldn't be overly concerned about that. As I said earlier, you had some developing market, like Brazil, I think we saw a slowdown as well, but more than that, it's I wouldn't be overly concerned about it and I am not. And I think that's maybe the best piece for me to be in it, that I'm not overly concerned. But as I said, maybe in Q4 we will see equal quarter to Q3 until some uncertainty is in place. But as you see, we continue to invest. I told you about we did one acquisition in Switzerland for Health Information System, and then we also signed a partnership with Verily, both Verily and 3M, two very creative dynamic companies that are building out platforms. So we look very, very positively to not only Health Information System but all businesses in that business group.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: One last quick one just on Q4. Nick, I think the implied price cost margin tailwind is about 40 basis points if I back into the 100 basis points you're guiding to for the year given you've been above that so far for the year. Is that about the right number for the fourth quarter? Is that just conservatism or is that kind of a new solid run rate to expect going forward, just trying to split the goalpost there a little bit?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah, Steve, we have been seeing the benefits from raw materials slipping as we move from quarter to quarter. The 40 basis points where you're doing the math of coming out with 100 basis points, I'd call that more just a function of rounding where the actual math might come out a little higher than that and we're just rounding it to approximately 100 basis points. I wouldn't over read that Steve.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. That makes sense. That's sort of our job to over read everything, sorry. Thanks. Talk to you soon.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Thanks.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for some closing comments\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing the 3M playbook and preparing our company for the future. As you know, we have done a lot of work over the last several years to adjust our portfolio, improve our cost structure, enhance our technology capabilities and make us even more relevant to customers. So while the macro environment is challenging at the moment, we are positioned well for when global growth conditions improve. This is true both for developed and developing markets where we have the experience, the market position and depth of capabilities to capitalize on the win as their economies recover. With that, I think you for joining us this morning, and we're looking forward to see you in New York on December 13. Have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded Tuesday, July 26, 2016. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland - Director-Investor Relations: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Second Quarter 2016 Business Review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO, and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments and then we'll take your questions. As a reminder, please mark your calendars for upcoming earnings call dates, October 25 and January 24. Also take note of our next Investor Meeting, scheduled for December 13. More details will be available as we get closer to that date. Today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide two. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important Risk Factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to slide three and I'll hand it off to Inge.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered another strong performance in the second quarter, marked by our highest quarterly earnings per share in 3M history, driven by increased margins. At the same time, we were active in deploying capital to both invest in the long-term success of our enterprise and return cash to our shareholders. Looking at the numbers, earnings were $2.08 per share, up 3% year over year. Organic sales were down slightly, at minus 20 basis points. Our two domestic-driven businesses once again paced our company's organic growth in the quarter. Health Care posted 5% growth, with positive growth in all businesses and geographic areas. And Consumer grew 3%, driven by strong performance in our Command, Filtrete, and Post-it products. Safety & Graphics also delivered solid growth, while Industrial was down slight, low-single digits. Organic growth in Electronics & Energy declined in the high-single digits, as we communicated during the second quarter. That business continues to be impacted by weaker demand and elevated channel inventories in the consumer electronics market. Acquisitions net of divestitures added more than 1 percentage point to our sales, while the strong U.S. dollar reduced sales by similar amount. As a result, we delivered total sales of $7.7 billion in the quarter. In a global environment that remains uncertain, our team continues to focus on driving efficient growth and premium returns. In the second quarter, we delivered healthy margins of 24.4%, up 50 basis points year over year. Four of our five business groups posted margins above 23%, including Health Care at 33% and Safety & Graphics at 27%, demonstrating the breadth of our strength. Our ability to generate premium returns along with strong free cash flow enables us to consistently invest in the business while also returning cash to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we invested 10% of sales into the combination of research and development and capital expenditure, which is important to our business model and bolsters our foundation for the future. Also with an eye on the future, we continued to make good progress on Business Transformation, which is one of our three key levers. At our Investor Day in March, you heard me talk about Customer First, an initiative that is ingrained in everything we do, including Business Transformation. It is all about making it easier and quicker for our customers to do business with us everywhere around the world. To-date, we have deployed our ERP system, which is the backbone of our Business Transformation, in a dozen countries as well as in four of our largest European distribution centers. Most recently, in the second quarter we had two successful rollouts in West Europe, specifically in our operations in Austria and Switzerland. We have also expanded the scale and impact of our three Global Service Centers located in Costa Rica, Poland, and Philippines. Through these centers, we are building a platform for operational efficiencies today and into the future. Business Transformation is strengthening our company; it starts and ends with our customers and has significant long-term benefits. We expect to result at $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020 and $0.5 billion reduction in working capital. In summary, we had a good performance in the second quarter in terms of increased margins, strong earnings and investments in the business while also returning $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. With that, I will turn the call over to Nick, who will take you through more of the details. Nick?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my comments on slide four with a summary of our Q2 sales performance. Organic local currency sales declined 0.2% in the second quarter, with volumes down 1.3% and selling prices up 1.1%. Acquisitions net of divestitures added 1.4 percentage points to our sales. This includes the acquisitions of Capital Safety and Membrana, net of three small divestitures. Finally, foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.5%. In dollar terms, worldwide sales declined 0.3% versus the second quarter of 2015. Organic growth in the United States was up 0.4%, with solid performances in our domestic-oriented businesses, namely, Health Care and Consumer, as well as in Safety & Graphics. Similar to first quarter, U.S. manufacturing activity remained soft in Q2. This, combined with continued weakness in the oil and gas end market, impacted portions of our Industrial business. In Asia-Pacific, organic growth was down 5.4%. Strong growth from our Health Care and Consumer businesses was more than offset by a double-digit decline in Electronics & Energy as we continued to experience soft end-market demand and channel inventory adjustments in consumer electronics. Within Asia-Pacific, organic growth was down 1% in Japan and 7% in China/Hong Kong. Excluding our electronics-related businesses, Japan was up 2% and China/Hong Kong down 2%. Moving to EMEA. We posted organic growth of 3% in the quarter, led by West Europe. We delivered growth across all businesses in West Europe. From a country perspective, growth was led by Germany and France. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada increased 4.8%, with Canada up 6% and Mexico up 5%, while Brazil declined 2%. Please turn to slide five for the second quarter P&L highlights. Second quarter sales were $7.7 billion and earnings were $2.08 per share. Operating margins improved by 50 basis points year on year to 24.4%, an all-time record margin for the second quarter. The combination of lower raw materials and higher selling prices contributed 130 basis points to our margin improvement, while lower pension and OPEB expense increased margins by another 110 basis points. Productivity gains related to last year's fourth quarter restructuring expanded margins by an additional 40 basis points. Lower year-on-year organic volumes, inventory declines and related utilization impacts reduced margins by 110 basis points. The lower utilization was most pronounced in Electronics and, to a lesser extent, Industrial. Foreign currency translation impacts net of hedge gains decreased margins by 30 basis points. Strategic investments also reduced margins by 30 basis points, as we accelerated growth investments and took actions to further optimize our manufacturing footprint. As a reminder, we expect the impact of strategic investments to increase in the second half of the year. Finally, legal and other factors reduced margins by 60 basis points in the quarter, 50 basis points of which related to an unfavorable arbitration ruling on a long-standing insurance claim. For reference, our Q2 corporate and unallocated expense was up $47 million sequentially, primarily due to this unfavorable arbitration ruling. For the full year, we expect corporate and unallocated expense to be in the range of $150 million to $200 million. Let's now turn to slide six for a look at EPS. We posted earnings of $2.08 per share in the second quarter, up 3% year-over-year. Margin expansion net of organic sales declines contributed $0.04 to our earnings per share improvement. First year acquisitions and divestitures added another $0.03 to earnings, driven by solid performances from both Capital Safety and Membrana. Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduced pre-tax earnings by $40 million, or the equivalent of $0.04 a share. The second quarter tax rate was 29.6% versus 28.1% in last year's comparable quarter, which decreased Q2 earnings by $0.04. And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% year on year, which added $0.07 to second quarter EPS. Please turn to slide seven for a look at our cash flow performance. Operating cash flow was $1.3 billion in the second quarter and $2.5 billion year-to-date. Our strong cash flow enables us to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. CapEx investments in Q2 totaled $323 million, and we continue to expect full year CapEx in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. These investments drive organic growth, strengthen our manufacturing technologies and support business transformation. Free cash flow conversion was 75% in the quarter, similar to last year. For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%. In addition to investing in our businesses, we returned significant cash to shareholders, including $672 million in dividends, up $26 million year on year. We also returned $828 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases. Through the first half of 2016, we have repurchased $2.1 billion of our own shares. We continue to anticipate full year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $4 billion to $6 billion. Let's now review each of our business groups, starting on slide eight. Our Industrial business group posted sales of $2.6 billion in the second quarter. Organic growth was down 1.4%, reflecting the continued economic challenges in the global industrial sector. Positive Q2 growth in Latin America/Canada and EMEA was more than offset by declines in Asia-Pacific and the U.S. As mentioned earlier, manufacturing activity in the U.S. remained soft in Q2, which impacted parts of our Industrial business. Looking across our Industrial business group, our automotive OEM business grew high single digits again this quarter and continued to outpace global car and light truck builds. We also posted mid-single digit organic growth in our automotive aftermarket business, which is gaining share in the collision and auto care markets. Advanced materials declined year on year, impacted by ongoing weakness in the oil and gas market. On a related positive note, this business was recently awarded a $93 million body armor contract from the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency to be realized over the next 18 months. Acquisitions net of divestitures added 2.6% to Industrial sales growth in the quarter. This figure represents the Membrana acquisition net of the recent Polyfoam divestiture. Membrana continues to deliver strong results, exceeding its financial objectives since acquisition. The business continues to expand its geographic presence, which includes recent contract wins with two life science customers in China. Finally, our Industrial business delivered operating income of $615 million in Q2 and margins rose 30 basis points to 23.4%. Please turn to slide nine. Safety & Graphics delivered a solid quarter, with sales of $1.5 billion and organic growth of 2.3%. Our roofing granules business posted another strong quarter of double-digit organic growth, as demand increased in the replacement shingle market. Commercial solutions also delivered a solid quarter, with notable strength in EMEA and the U.S. Within this business, new product sales in architectural markets and floor care products boosted the organic growth. Acquisitions net of divestitures added 4.6% to sales growth in the quarter. This figure includes Capital Safety net of two small divestitures. The Capital Safety business is already benefiting from access to our company's 46 core technology platforms. For example, the team recently leveraged two of those platforms to create and launch a new detachable self-rescue fall protection device. On a geographic basis, organic growth in Safety & Graphics was led by Latin America/Canada and the U.S. at mid-single digits, while Asia-Pacific declined year on year. Operating income was $411 million and operating margins increased 2 percentage points to 27.4%. Profits in this business continued to be boosted by recent portfolio management actions along with solid productivity efforts. Please turn to slide 10. Our Health Care business delivered another strong quarter across the entire portfolio. Sales increased 3% to $1.4 billion and organic growth was 4.9%, which once again led the company. As Inge mentioned, organic growth was broad based, with all businesses and geographic areas up year on year. By geography, Latin America/Canada and Asia-Pacific each posted high-single digit growth in the quarter. Health Care also generated high-single digit organic growth in developing countries, with strong contributions from China/Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico. Looking by business, organic growth was led by food safety, health information systems, and medical consumables. Operating income was $460 million, up 4.3% year over year and margins remain strong, at 32.7%. Next I will cover Electronics & Energy on slide 11. Second quarter sales in Electronics & Energy were $1.2 billion, down 9.1% organically. Organic sales on the Electronics side of the business were down 14%. We continue to be impacted by weak end-market demand across most consumer electronics applications. At the same time, channel inventories continue to adjust and we expect these challenges to persist into the second half of the year. Our Energy-related businesses declined 2% organically, with growth in Telecom being more than offset by declines in electrical markets and renewable energy. On a geographic basis, organic growth was down double digits in Asia-Pacific, impacted by the declines in electronics. Second quarter operating income for Electronics & Energy was $229 million, with margins of 19.3%. As mentioned earlier, during Q2 we took actions within Electronics & Energy to better position the business going forward. These actions reduced Q2 margins in this business by 80 basis points. Adjusting for these actions, underlying margins were 20.1%. In light of continued end-market challenges, we now expect full year 2016 organic sales in Electronics & Energy to decline by high-single digits. Please turn to slide 12, where I will cover our Consumer business. Consumer had another solid quarter, with sales of $1.1 billion and organic growth of 2.7%. Organic sales growth was led by our home improvement and consumer health care businesses. Recent accelerated growth investments in Command damage-free mounting products and ScotchBlue painter's tape continue to pay off, driving strong double-digit organic growth in both cases. Filtrete filters continued to gain share and delivered strong growth in the quarter. In our Consumer Health Care business, we're driving strong growth in our FUTURO line of compression solutions, health braces, and supports. The back-to-school season got off to a good start in the second quarter, led by strong sales of Post-it and Command solutions. Geographically, Consumer's organic growth was led by Asia-Pacific along with solid growth in the U.S. Operating income was $281 million, with operating margins of 24.9%. Solid organic growth, prioritization of investments and productivity efforts contributed to strong margin performance in the quarter. That wraps up my formal comments. Now I will turn the call back over to Inge. Inge?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Nick. As I look across our enterprise, each of our businesses is facing slightly different market realities, yet all of them are executing very well. Six months into the year, four of our five business groups are growing in line with our expectations entering the year. And for reasons we have stated, Electronics & Energy is growing below those expectations. As a result, today we're updating our planning estimates for 2016. Organic growth is now estimated to be 0% to 1% against previous guidance of 1% to 3%. With respect to earnings per share, we are raising the low end of our guidance from $8.10 to $8.15 and adjusting the high end from $8.45 to $8.30, resulting in an expected increase of 8% to 10% year on year. We anticipate foreign currency to reduce 2016 sales by 1% to 2% versus the prior estimate reduction of 1% to 3%. And our full year tax rate is now expected to be 29% to 29.5% versus the previous range of 29.5% to 30.5%. Finally, there is no change to our free cash flow conversion range, which remains 95% to 105%. With that, I thank you for your attention. And we will now take your questions.\nOperator: Please limit your participation to one question and one follow-up. One moment, please, while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning, guys.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Andrew.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Morning, Andy.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): So your price versus raw materials actually went up in 2Q to 1.3% from 1.1% in 1Q. We know you've talked about your benefit from price versus raw materials actually being front-half loaded this year, but pricing's been trending a little higher than you thought. Raw materials, have they still been a little lower than you thought? You did get positive pricing in the U.S. after nothing last quarter and really after you spoke about increased competitive environment in the U.S. So did you see an improvement in the pricing environment in the U.S. in particular?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Andy, there's several things you're asking there. For the second quarter and then I'll expand it to talk about the total year for price raw materials, we, as I said earlier, saw 130 basis points of margin expansion from that, up slightly from where we were in the first quarter. Of that 130 basis points, 90 basis points is related to lower year-on-year commodity prices and the other 40 basis points is coming from our pricing growth that we see not related to FX movement. Our total price growth that we posted this year, we still see the majority of that coming from adjustments we're making in pricing related to FX movement. But once we strip that out, we still see 40 basis points of core price growth that we're seeing in our business and we don't see a reason for that to change as we look into the second half. If you remember, Andrew, over a long period of time, we see our range for that core price growth being between 30 basis points and 50 basis points. So as I look at this for the total year, we now expect the combination of price raw materials to be benefiting our margin by approximately 100 basis points. Six months ago I was saying I expected it to be about 50 basis points, but we're seeing some improvement in commodity prices from what we were anticipating for the second half of the year and pricing is slightly better than what we had expected.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): That's helpful, Nick. And, Inge, when you look at the goals that you set out at the Analyst Day, the 2% to 5% organic growth over the next several years, $500 million to $700 million in business transformation, $125 million to $175 million of factory optimization, then you think about the current environment where you may record pretty marginal organic growth this year, does it change your urgency at all around your cost-out initiatives? Can you accelerate these initiatives at all or find more cost out if we're in a lower for longer growth environment?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we are focusing on that the whole time, as you know. And answer to it, yes, of course, we have to do it if that is what will be demanded. Now, we are very early, as you know, into that five-year plan. Basically two quarters. But I think we have to look upon it as we roll out if there's something that needs to be done in specific segments or pockets. And if you look upon it today, four of our five business groups are, at this point in time, just in line with the expectation we had for this year. The one that have a challenge based on end markets is Electronics & Energy. And we have done a lot in that business group the last couple of years. So it's like \u2013 it's not a surprise for us that there are changes in that market. We have addressed it the whole time. And we will do that everywhere as we go ahead. But when I look upon it in terms of how solid the four business groups are executing the plan at this point in time, I hope that we don't need to take drastic action in those businesses.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks, Inge.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. And good morning, everyone.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Joe.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Inge, maybe just touch on China for a second. Excluding Electronics, China/Hong Kong was down 2% this quarter. So it seems like you're seeing some weakness across some of your other businesses. So maybe talk a little bit about that. And also across the portfolio, if you can just touch on touch on trends, whether trends got better or worse as the quarter progressed.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I think, first of all, in total China, in our portfolio there based on how that has been built over the years based on the China market, which was, I would say, very much related initially to export for them, we have a bigger portion there which is Electronics and Industrial. And for reasons that we know relative to that market have been slower, maybe the last two years now when we start to look upon it, nothing's changed there by definition this quarter more than more pressure in Electronics. Consumer and Health Care is doing very well for us. So when you look into that, Consumer had 9% growth, and Health Care, 11% growth. So if you look upon that, it's like 9% to 11% growth in domestic businesses. That's very good. Also when you look upon Industrial, Industrial improved a little bit. But to be honest, I'm not happy with the growth rate we see for Industrial in China. So we need to see more from Industrial, and I think it's coming as we move ahead. China for us, and I talk for 3M now, we have been very, very precisely driving our productivity improvement there for the last, I would say, for six quarters we have focused a lot on productivity improvements. So underlining results in China is good for us. We need to get more growth as that market turns around. The encouraging thing is that domestic businesses is going very, very well for us at this point in time.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And the underlying trends, did things get better or worse as the quarter progressed?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I don't know about the quarter specifically. But in my view, we will see, based on comp as well, we will see China do slightly better as we move ahead. But think about China for the year flat as we end up the year.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then maybe, Nick, one follow-up. I just want to make sure I understand all the puts and takes, especially as we get into 4Q on the margin side. It looks like your margins can be up at least 250 basis points, 300 basis points because you did all those restructuring actions in 4Q of last year. So maybe step us through the puts and takes for 4Q. I just want to make sure I have them straight.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Oh, for just fourth quarter? Yeah. The biggest put and take in the fourth quarter will be the comparison to fourth quarter last year, which had a restructuring. Other puts and takes will continue to be getting benefits from price raw materials. Strategic investments, as I've mentioned earlier, will be larger in the second half than it was in the first half, so that'll be part of the puts and takes. But the biggest driver that's going to change is going to be the year-on-year impact of not repeating the restructuring that we had in fourth quarter of 2015.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And we can go through the color offline. I'll get back in queue. Thanks, guys.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob McCarthy of Stifel, Nicolaus & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Rob.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Morning, Rob.\nRobert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, a couple questions specifically on your European exposure. Obviously, you had very strong results, particularly led by Western Europe in the quarter. But given recent geopolitical events, Brexit, et cetera, could you speak as to what you've been seeing in your shorter cycle businesses there? And then the follow-up, and there won't be a follow-up from here so it will just be two parts and I will get off the phone, is just longer term, as you think about your ERP and other initiatives and potential SKU rationalization, do you have to rethink that in the context of an extended break-up of the eurozone? In other words, will you have to change your long-term strategy there? Because there is a strategy for further cost take-out, but I think the tacit assumption is continued economic integration of the eurozone.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, this is Inge. So, first of all, UK for us is less than 3% as an enterprise in terms of revenue. And we had a very good result this quarter in West Europe, as you saw, with 3% organic local currency growth with all business groups growing, which is very, very nice to see, to be honest. So we had Industrial at 3%, we had SGBG 2%, we had Health Care, 5%, we had EEBG 5%, and we had Consumer 2%. If you think about Europe and put that in perspective with what we have to do, there's no reason for us to change strategy around Europe. Our strategy has always been to have localization in terms of execution based on languages. And, number two, build up a very strong backbone relative to resources what we now do with ERP. And we have worked for long time in order to reduce the layers in organization and management groups. And we have regionalized Europe over three years ago. So we don't have subsidiaries in every country any longer. We work on regions. So we have reduced the cost very much in terms of administration, helping the businesses with execution centrally and then execute locally with the teams in every country. There is no reason for us to change the strategy in Europe based on the outcome of the Brexit. No reason for us to do that. The other thing that is very nice for us to see is the margin expansion that is coming for us in West Europe as well. And as I said before, when some of you have asked around which business group can add more margin expansion to you as we move forward, the answer has always been all of them, because all of them are part of West Europe. And West Europe's margins are now starting to increase in a nice way. So we're very pleased with the performance there. There is issues in Europe. But you know what? There's issues everywhere around the world. And you have just to stay the course and adjust if you need. But the Brexit short-term for us doesn't mean anything, to be honest, based on our operation. And I don't see a reason at this point in time to change the laid-out plan we have for Europe.\nRobert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your time.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thank you very much.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Good morning. Just on the buyback, as you said, I think you spent around $2 billion in the first half. I see you're running at sort of the low end of the full year placeholder. Is there anything interesting in that? Or is it the fact that the share price obviously bounced a decent amount from where you were buying in Q1? Should we read anything into your M&A appetite? And maybe just touch on how you're thinking about M&A right now, because it's been a while since things like Capital Safety were enacted.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, Julian, I don't think you should over-read it. We started the year and we continue to have a range of $4 billion to $6 billion. And with $2.1 billion through the first half of the year, we're currently tracking to the low end of the range. The pace and the amount of the repurchases is dependent on demands of capital, such as for M&A, and it's also dependent on the relative value we see in the stock price. Our model is sensitive to share price. And the range that we put out allows flexibility with our capital allocation decisions. So in short, I'd say, Julian, don't over-read anything in our $4 billion to $6 billion range. We're just holding to that right now partly because there's a lot of uncertainties that can happen in the second half of the year.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. And then my follow-up would just be on the margin guide for the year. Apologies if I missed it. But are you still guiding for about 150 bps of increase for the year? And then just a quick corollary of that would be should we think that Q2's increase of 50 bps year-on-year is the low point in terms of margin increase and Q3 should see a bigger increase year-on-year?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Julian, for the year, we're in the range of 100 basis points to 150 basis points of margin expansion. Some puts and takes in there. The price raw materials we're seeing is slightly better than we did at the beginning of the year. And the lower volume and related lower utilization of assets is the negative impacting that margin. So 100 basis points to 150 basis points for the year. We consider the first and the fourth quarter to be the quarters with the most margin expansion and second and third quarter to be the two lower quarters of margin expansion.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, gents.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Hi, Nigel.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi. So obviously the biggest delta on full year guidance at the top line is due to E&E. I think I understand that. I think, Inge, you mentioned that all of the four segments are tracking in line with plan. Obviously, Industrial's tracking a bit lower than the 0% to 3% year-to-date. Do you still see a credible path back to positive growth in Industrial in the back half of the year?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, yes, I do. And part of that is, of course, how we will be compared to last year. But we see us performing better in the second half of the year in Industrial versus we have done in the first part of the year. We had a challenge this quarter specifically in United States for Industrial, and that will come back as we move forward into Q3 and Q4. When you look upon the guidance in total, we see Health Care and Consumer continue to perform very well. The same with Safety & Graphics, which I've talked about earlier, is the business that will be the next breakout business. And I think we saw it this quarter that it's now coming full speed. And then Electronics & Energy, as we have talked about, will be, as Nick said and I said as well, we will see decline for the year in that business to high single digits. And then Industrial, I think due to the comparison, will do slightly better for us.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, the comp will get easier in 4Q for sure.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: But we have put the guidance now 0% to 1% for the company. It's very much related to Electric & Energy (sic) [Electronics & Energy] (41:12).\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Sure. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. And then for Nick, UTX just sort of softly cautioned on pension for next year based on where those current rates are today. You're obviously very pension sensitive as well. I'm just wondering if you snap a line today on discount rates, what sort of pension headwind could we be looking at next year?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, for our pension expense, if we snapped the rates right now, it would become a headwind for us in 2017. It's really too early with five and a half more months to go before that gets set, so I'm not going to comment on the magnitude of it. But if we stopped right now, it would be a headwind for us in 2017.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks. And good morning, all.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Steven.\nSteven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Just to put a finer point on the answer to Nigel's question. I guess this is the third quarter of negative organic growth. Do you actually \u2013 if you think about next quarter versus the fourth quarter, are you expecting growth to at least \u2013 organic local currency growth to go positive in the third quarter still?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes, Steven, let me take that one. As we progress through the year, third quarter, we could be similar to what we saw in the second quarter for organic growth to slightly better. We'll see, as Inge mentioned, improving trends in Industrial more driven by comps. But we will continue to see declines in our Electronics & Energy business. The fourth quarter, based in our view right now, is where we'll see the most significant year-on-year comp benefits for our organic growth, which will propel us into the 0% to 1% range. But the third quarter I wouldn't be looking for a dramatic turnaround from the growth rates that we've seen in the second quarter.\nSteven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. That's really helpful. And then just one detail point. How much did you actually end up spending then on restructuring compared to that $20 million placeholder you had talked about?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, three months ago I said that we expected that expense to be approximately $20 million. As we progressed through the quarter, we executed on all the actions we planned, the price tag for that came in closer to $10 million than to $20 million. We found some ways to do it more efficiently so it ended up being a slight benefit from what we were thinking.\nSteven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: But with the same payback dollars?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Exact same payback that we're expecting. This will pay for itself this year.\nSteven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi. Good morning, Steve.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Just remind us where you guys stand on the foreign exchange hedging. I know that there's a bit of a carryover some years. If you just held the line at $1.10, would you have any kind of carryover from hedging next year?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: As we go into next year, Steve, if things just stayed where they were, the biggest impact we'd have on our earnings in 2017 would be the diminishment of our hedging gains. So we're experiencing hedging gains this year of approximately $100 million. If FX did not move, that $100 million would drop substantially. There'd still be slight gains in 2017, but minimal.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And then just on the pension, just remind us what the sensitivity is. You don't have to give us a number for next year. But just every 25 bps, what's the expense headwind?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: This is a little dated, Steve. But at one time, the sensitivity was about $1 million for every basis point.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nShannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Morning, guys.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Morning, Shannon.\nShannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. On the Safety & Graphics margins, a lot going your way this quarter. Capital Safety, looked like roofing granules had a good quarter. But you talked about it as the next breakout business, too, Inge. So I'm just trying to figure out with margins up here 27% plus, is this a particularly favorable quarter mix-wise in other things? Or is this a ramp that we expect to continue?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, well, first of all, we have done a lot in that business relative to the portfolio. And it's an ongoing process. And I think that is now what we see the benefit on. When we started that process quite some years back when we start really to look upon what we call underperforming businesses, which is the standard is very high, as you know, inside of 3M when you're running at those type of margins. I think the guys have done a fantastic job relative to sort out low margin businesses that were inside of certain division in that group. And we also, as you know, we divested some businesses, which was a converter business in France relative to license plates that was not strategically important. And, by the way, we are not a converter in that industry. So I think that when you start to add things together with building out the strength in position with addition of Capital Safety to our Personal Safety business and then you look upon the whole Graphics side and the Transportation side in terms of the work they have done in order to work on the mix, that is the outcome of the result. We expect this business to continue to grow and accelerate growth, in fact. And we should be able to run the margins around this area at this point in time as we move forward. And, please \u2013 our leader there, Frank Little, he had told me that he's very confident that he can do that.\nShannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then on Electronics. So the weak volumes and the excess inventory has been going on for a long time. Looks like they're going to continue. And when do you expect Electronics to return to growth? And are you still comfortable with the strategic positioning there beyond the near-term volume challenges?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, to start with your last question, the answer is yes. And the Electronic business is a good business for us to be in. We're a material science company and the strengths of our capabilities in that market is very, very strong. So from a strategic perspective, there is no question mark for me. And when you look upon the four fundamentals that we have in the company in terms of technology, manufacturing capabilities and geographical reach plus brand equity, it's very, very good for us. And as we all know, in terms of Electronics, it's growing generally speaking. And we are all touched by it every day in what we do. So that is what 3M should be. So the answer to that question is, yes, it is a place for us to be. And as you have seen, we have adjusted our structure the whole time as that market is a little bit volatile. But as you know, volatility also has an upside and we will be there to capitalize on that when it comes. I don't think we will see anything this year in terms of change. So I think we have to wait until some time in 2017 before we will see growth, specifically in consumer electronic taking place. Now, there is something called automotive electronics that is accelerating more and more. We make specific investment there in order to capture that as we move ahead. So I will say that it's a volatile market as we speak. The team is doing an outstanding job. And you saw again here, we had 80 basis points in terms of restructuring for the quarter. You take that out, they were running over 20% again in the quarter. So despite pressure on volume, the structure is done now to be able to deliver around 20% of operating income for the company. For me, that's good. So I compliment their team for what they are doing in terms of efficiency in a tougher situation. And they're all preparing for when the upturn is coming. And I would like it to come soon, but I don't think we can see it 2016. But 2017 will soon be here anyhow.\nShannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thanks.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, guys. Good morning.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Andrew.\nAndrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes. If I look at your margin walk, organic volume was a big drag. And as I look historically, I think it's the biggest one I have in a while. Can you just talk about the fact that given the organic growth was close to zero, why the volume drag was so big? I would imagine it relates to the consumer electronics business in Asia. But is that what we should expect going forward, the disproportionate impact?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Hey, Andrew. I'll take that. As you look at our margin walk for Q2, what we're calling that is organic volume and utilization. And that's a little different from how it was last quarter where we had those two separated out. So what's driving the utilization negative impact? First of all, having the organic growth down 20 basis points. That's part of that. We also saw \u2013 we reduced our inventories in the second quarter, which has little lower throughput through our manufacturing facilities. And then the third and probably most significant of these is lower asset utilization in our Electronics business and, to a lesser extent, in our Industrial business. Those are the main things going on. During the second half, we expect the asset utilization to improve, but not necessarily to be positive impact on the margin. It will improve, and that's aligned with our expectation full year operating margin expansion for the year being between 100 basis points and 150 basis points.\nAndrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And just a follow-up question on Health Care. You're posting 5% organic growth. Can you just talk about your internal efforts to dedicate more resources internally to Health Care? How sustainable is this growth? If there is a structural change in the rate of growth now that you dedicate more assets internally? And is there ability to dedicate even more resources to accelerate this growth?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, this is Inge. We had made a commitment many years back to accelerate the investment in Health Care. And that is what is paying off. And when I look across every geographical area in every sense we are growing \u2013 when I look up on the sheet that I have in front of me for Health Care, we are growing every place around the world except for in Brazil. And it's very remarkable in a way that the way we're able to take market share and grow in most of the segments. And, again, food safety led the growth with 12% in the quarter and it's broad based. And the same is going for the oral care business, it's growing very well. So there's a broad base for us in terms of growth. And we are, as you'll recall, we decided to not only keep Health Information Systems, but also accelerate investment into that business. So it's a very high priority for us. And we are making investment in most, if not all, of the divisions there as we move ahead.\nAndrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Morning, Deane.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, Nick. Can we start with you on the tax expectation that you've lowered it slightly? Last quarter, we talked about tax would be actually higher in the back half of the year. You were going to do some repatriating of cash. Are you still doing that? Is this a net effect? And where does the cash repatriation stand today?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Deane, when I guided last quarter, our expectation for tax rate for the remaining quarters of the year and for the total year, it was also at a time that we had adopted the new accounting standard on the way tax benefits are treated on the income statement related to employee stock-based compensation. Our view at that time was the majority of that benefit would be coming in the first quarter and that with our cash repatriation plans we'd be seeing a higher tax rate in the second, third and fourth quarter. As far as the cash movement, that continues according to our plan. The difference that we saw during the second quarter is due to the strong 3M stock performance, we saw increased benefit coming from that adoption of the accounting standards through increased employee stock option exercises. And that brought our tax rate down lower than what we were expecting for the second quarter. And that's the driver for why we lowered our tax rate guidance for the entire year.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. I'd call that a high-quality problem. And then for Inge. Maybe you can give us an update with a bit more specifics on Membrana. The slide called out you're exceeding financial expectations. Maybe a sense about how many businesses is Membrana expected to touch? You made a reference that Capital Safety is being rolled out to \u2013 there's 46 different product areas. I would imagine Membrana has probably higher potential to touch more 3M businesses. So maybe an update on Membrana, both from the financial standpoint and new products.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, first of all, the integration is going very well and we have, as you know, first of all, it's relative to the purification business where we tried it integrate that as fast as we can. And I think first things first, make sure we integrate it into 3M, make sure we can capitalize on what we can do together with purification business and then build it out as we go. I will not give you an exact number relative to how many businesses because I think it's more relative to platforms where you can use it. And I think about specifically going into Health Care and all that area where I think is big opportunity. So you think about that, you should be able to use it in Industrial applications, but you should also be able to use it in application that is specifically into Health Care. In terms of the growth rate, we grew that 5% in this quarter and we think it's like 8% plus for the year. And I think you will see the benefits in terms of all the synergy that we can drive. So I cannot give you exactly a number on divisions. But think about it as bigger platforms, both in Industrial and in Health Care specifically.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Morning, Jeff.\nJeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: I got on a little late, Inge, so I apologize if you covered this. But I just wanted to touch on what's going on in auto. Can you give a little more color on your performance in the quarter? And can you scale for us the magnitude of the outgrowth that you're seeing in the business relative to production builds?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, well, first of all, automotive again did very well for us. And we had 7% growth versus auto car builds of 3%. So again, we outperformed. And when I look upon it on a geographical base, we were strong everywhere. We were strong everywhere around the world. I think maybe a little bit versus comparison earlier, maybe down a little bit in Mexico versus what we have seen before. But more than that, we saw good growth everywhere, including Germany. Generally speaking, we had a very good quarter in Germany, and that's very encouraging. We grew 5% in Germany in the quarter as a total enterprise, and automotive was part of that as well. So to answer your question, 7% up for automotive OEM versus car builds of 3%.\nJeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: And then if you look forward, Inge, based on production plans and content that you know you have in hand, would you expect that 4% type of differential to hold into the next year or two? Do you have visibility on that?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I expect that to hold as we move ahead. The advantage for us is that we can expand the application on the car. So we don't sell four tires. There's only four tires on a car and then maybe one spare tire. So if that's your model, you have a limitation. Our limitation is not there. So we can expand applications on the car. So I will say the penetration level that that group is driving for us is very impressive in the way I look upon it. And I expect good results from them as we move ahead.\nJeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thank you very much.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, everyone. Good morning.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Morning, John.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Hey, Nick. So I want to go back to the ASU 2016-09. So you guys adopted this and it gave you a $0.10 benefit in the first quarter. And then you said you were going to repatriate cash to offset it. But then it looks like the lower tax rate's going to benefit you by $0.09 to $0.10. So I'm just trying to understand, what's the net of this? Is this basically the year? Is it that you're not repatriating any cash? Or you're repatriating less? Because obviously there's moving parts with respect to your stock price and other things. I'm just curious. Like what was the net benefit of these two impacts in the second quarter?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, John, I'll first talk about the total year and then I'll try to bring it into the quarter for you.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Sure.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: So for the year, at the time what I said three months ago is, yes, we're getting that benefit in the first quarter. But with our cash repatriation, it will end up being neutral for the year. We now for the year see a total benefit of approximately $0.10 net all-in, if we net the ASU, we net the cash repatriation. And the third piece that I'll remind you of is it also has impact on our share count. It increases our number of diluted shares outstanding, so the net impact we now see is approximately $0.10 for the total year. For the second quarter, the roughly 150 basis points lower that we saw in our tax rate from what I had originally guided, all of that is coming from the increased employee stock options that we saw in the second quarter. Nothing has changed on our plans that we communicated for cash repatriation and cash movements around the world.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So if it was $0.10 positive in the first quarter and it's going to be neutral for the year, and it sounds like with the lower tax rate, it was still a positive in the second quarter, is this a drag in the back half? Except that your tax rate's coming down, so I guess you would expect (1:03:36).\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, so in the second half of the year we're anticipating that we'll have lower employee stock options and there hence lower tax benefit from that in the second half of the year. That's built into our current guidance for the tax rate. But we'll continuing to be seeing the headwinds from our cash repatriation and cash movement actions that we're taking.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then you guys lowered the annual guide \u2013 I mean, there's obviously \u2013 you roll all this up, there's a lot of below-the-line moving parts, various levels of tax rate movement and swings and options and so forth. Is the implication that because you lowered your annual EPS guidance by $0.05 that there wasn't an ability to find some below-the-line items to provide that offset? Because the $0.05 isn't really that much. So I'm trying to understand if there's an implication that you're sort of saying, we've already underspent on our restructuring, we've already sort of maxed out this stock option, what was going to be a headwind turned into a bit of a tailwind or whatever versus expectations. Is that kind of the signaling here?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: John, the signaling I'd take from that is we continue to see very good investment opportunities for the company. Opportunities that we've talked about for strategic investments, investments in accelerating growth in Health Care as I think Jeff just asked about that. So I see it as commitment that we see opportunities and we want to keep investing in those, not we're running out of options of what we can do to deliver current quarter or year's earnings.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's fair. And then just lastly, what's the biggest driver of the delta for foreign currency? Is it the euro, or was there some other expectation baked in? I realize you say you don't have a lot of pound exposure. Was there some other fine-tuning of this?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: The yen is part of that movement. That's probably the most significant deviation. The euro, I'd put very similar to what we've been expecting throughout the year.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Maybe if I could squeeze one more in. You did really well in Canada. Companies like Granger and others have done poorly in Canada. Is there any other color you could add to that market? Because that economy's sort of \u2013 it's kind of very mixed, I think is the best way to put it. How did you guys do such a good job, so to your credit?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think the team up there, yes, executed very well on the plan. And other thing that I think is important in that business for us up there, we have been there for long time. We have very good relation into the marketplace and our service level is very good. And one thing, Business Transformation starts and ends with the customer. Starts and end with the customer. Canada was one of the first places we have implemented that program, which is now more than two years ago. And it's working well for us in Canada. And when you can provide in the marketplace product that is adding value and provide good service that is based on the demand from the customer going into all your ERP system, result is coming. So there's a couple of things. Good growth, margin expansion. And I just think that team should be complimented for the way they operate today and the way they took on the ERP system as one of the first places for us on a global base to execute that and actually helped us a lot in terms of the rollout that you see now in Europe. So, yeah, it's a very, very nice result. Is it surprise? No, it's not. It is not. It is based on very good relation with customers, total dedication through what we call Customer First and then the ERP system help the customer and us in order to lay out the demand plans and then for us is to deliver on it.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, and to your credit, you also cast a spotlight on companies that don't seem to know what they're doing there. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLaurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Good morning.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Morning.\nLaurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: In the vein of the business redesign, as you've been in a slow growth environment for a while, do you think returns on R&D and innovation are deteriorating or improving? That is, is innovation more differentiated in this kind of environment? Or are you seeing it get more challenging to get adequate returns?\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think it's an imperative for you in order to be successful. It's not either/or. It's based on 3M's model where research and development is the heartbeat of the company and where we add value on very attractive price point and value point for our customers. That is helping them improve productivity and/or adding value to their end products. So for me, it's an imperative in order for you to be able to run a business like we are doing with very good return to our shareholders. It's becoming more and more important in my mind, if you would like to be successful long term, that you have a very robust research and development organization with good platforms that they can use. So you need technology platforms. And you need the brains and you need, equally important of course, input from your customers when you build those platforms.\nLaurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Thank you.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for some closing comments.\nInge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. To wrap up, our team delivered another good performance in the second quarter as it relates to both financial results and building for long-term success. Going forward, we will remain focused on executing the 3M playbook, delivering efficient growth and continuing to create greater value for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for joining us, and we look forward to talking with you soon again. Have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the 3M First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, April 26, 2016. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland: Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2016 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments and then we will take your questions. As a reminder, please mark your calendars for upcoming earnings call dates, July 26 and October 25. Also, take note of our next investor meeting scheduled for December 13. More details will be available as we get closer to that date. Today\u2019s earnings release and the slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 2. During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to Slide 3 and I will hand it off to Inge.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us again. We had opportunity to see many of you last month at our Investor Day, where we laid out 3M\u2019s new 5-year plan. We also updated you on the 3M playbook and how it is being executed across our enterprise to deliver efficient growth both today and into the future. In the first quarter, the 3M team continued to execute our playbook and delivered another strong operational performance. We increased margins more than a full percentage point and improved our cash flow generation by 20% year-over-year. At the same time, we continue to invest in the business, including opening a new world class laboratory in the United States while also returning cash to our shareholders. Looking at the numbers, we posted first quarter earnings of $2.05 per share, which is an increase of 11% year-over-year. Please note that this includes a $0.10 earnings benefit related to a new accounting standard that 3M adopted in the first quarter and Nick will provide more details during his comments. Adjusting for this impact, we delivered Q1 earnings of $1.95 per share. Company-wide, organic growth was down slightly at minus 1%. Three of our business groups grew organically in the quarter led by healthcare at 6%, with strong organic growth across all its businesses. Our Consumer business, which is the home to some of 3M\u2019s most iconic brands also delivered a good quarter of organic growth. I am very pleased that our two domestic-driven businesses, Health Care and Consumer, continue to do well and are off to a very good start in 2016. Safety and Graphics also posted solid organic growth with particular strengths in commercial solutions and personal safety. Organic growth in our industrial business was down low single-digits, which was similar to last quarter. And as expected, Electronics and Energy declined low double-digits. Electronics and Energy continued to be impacted by softness in the consumer electronics markets, which we expect to persist through the first half of the year. Acquisitions net of divestitures added 2 percentage points to first quarter sales, while foreign exchange reduced sales by 3%. As a result, our company total sales, was $7.4 billion, down 2% year-on-year. Our ability to consistently deliver premium margins remains a hallmark of 3M and is an important element of our focus on driving efficient growth. In the first quarter, we posted margins of 24%, up more than a full percentage point versus last year. Without the impact from last year\u2019s fourth quarter restructuring, we have expanded margins year-over-year for 10 consecutive quarters. Also in the quarter, we have returned nearly $2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This includes an 8% increase in our first quarter dividend which marks 3M\u2019s 58th consecutive year of dividend increases. All-in-all, we had a good start to the year with results that were in line with our expectations. Please turn to Slide 4. In addition to a strong financial performance in the quarter, we also made good progress on our three key levers starting with portfolio management. After strategic review of our Health Information Systems business, we decided that we could create the greatest value by retaining and further invest in that business. In fact, we plan to accelerate the investment across our entire global Health Care business, in research and development, health economics and commercialization capabilities to build strings on strings in both developed and developing markets. In February, we saw the Polyfoam business, which was a small non-core segment, within our industrial business group. Earlier, I mentioned the ongoing softness in the electronics markets. As you know, over the last few years, we have consolidated a number of businesses within Electronics and Energy, which has made us more relevant to our customers, more agile and more efficient. Today, we are announcing further actions to build upon that work. This action will reduce 250 positions worldwide with the majority of reductions on the electronics side of the business and result in an estimated Q2 charge of $20 million. This will further position Electronics and Energy for long-term success. And going forward, this business will continue to stay close to customers, advance its technology capabilities and increase productivity. Investing in innovation is the second lever and in the first quarter, we invested nearly $0.5 billion in research and development. Research and development supports organic growth and premium returns. And as you recall, we continued to step up investments in R&D from 5.5% of sales closer to 6%. In March, we also opened our new laboratory in the United States, which many of you had opportunity to see at our Investor Day. It will house 750 off-scientists who will leverage our 46 technology platforms to create unique cutting-edge solutions for our customers. Finally, in the first quarter, we continued to march forward with business transformation, which is our third lever. We had a successful ERP deployment in Germany and remain focused on executing the rollout plan across West Europe. Business transformation, which starts and ends with our customers, is important for our future especially as it relates to efficient growth. We expect these efforts to result in the $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020 and another $0.5 billion in working capital improvement. Overall, as I look at the quarter, we continue to execute the 3M playbook and deliver the strong performance in terms of both financial results and building our enterprise for the future. With that, I will turn the call over to Nick who will take you through the details. Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Thanks, Inge and good morning everyone. I will start on Slide 5 with a recap of our first quarter sales change. Organic local currency sales declined 0.8% in the first quarter, with volumes down 1.7%, partially offset by a 0.9% increase in selling prices. Acquisitions net of divestitures added 1.6 percentage points to sales. This impact includes the acquisitions of Capital Safety, Membrana and Ivera Medical, along with the divestitures of Library Systems, Polyfoam and the license plate converting business in France. Finally, foreign currency translation reduced sales by 3%. In U.S. dollars, total sales declined 2.2% versus the first quarter of 2015. In the United States, organic growth was up 0.3% with strong performances in our domestic-oriented businesses, namely Health Care and Consumer. Industrial production in the U.S. declined 1.3% in Q1, which impacted the growth in parts of our Industrial business. Organic growth in Asia-Pacific was down 5.6%. Three of five business groups posted positive growth in the region again led by Health Care and Consumer. Soft end market demand and excess channel inventories in Consumer Electronics resulted in a double-digit organic growth decline in Electronics and Energy. Within Asia-Pacific, organic growth was down 4% in China/Hong Kong and declined 8% in Japan. Excluding our Electronics business, Japan and China/Hong Kong were both flat. Moving to EMEA, organic growth increased 1.7%, West Europe was up slightly, and the combination of Central/East Europe and Middle East/Africa was up high single-digits. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada increased 4.2%. Mexico again had a strong quarter, with 10% organic growth and Brazil also posted positive organic growth of 2%. Please turn to Slide 6 for the first quarter P&L highlights. First quarter sales were $7.4 billion. Operating income increased more than 3% to $1.8 billion and earnings rose 10.8% to $2.05 per share. As Inge mentioned, we had another strong margin performance in the first quarter, up 130 basis points to 24.1%. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the first quarter margin improvement. The combination of lower raw materials and higher selling prices added 110 basis points to first quarter margins. We continue to benefit from both lower commodity prices and from our global sourcing team\u2019s ongoing efforts to reduce costs. Lower pension and OPEB expense increased margins by 100 basis points. Productivity gains related to last year\u2019s fourth quarter restructuring contributed 40 basis points to margins. Strategic investments reduced margins 10 basis points as we began to take actions on our manufacturing footprint and increased growth investments. Foreign currency net of hedge gains brought margins down another 10 basis points and first year acquisitions reduced margins by 20 basis points. The year-on-year decline in organic volume reduced margins by 30 basis points. And finally, utilization and other was a net 50 basis point headwind to margins. This included the impact of lower asset utilization, particularly in our Electronics and Industrial businesses, which was partially offset by divestiture gains in the quarter. Also, we continue to increase investments across the business to drive growth and strengthen our competitiveness going forward. All-in, we have started the year on a positive note with respect to margins and continued to expect approximately 150 basis points of margin improvement for the full year, which reflects our focus on delivering efficient growth. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 7 for a closer look of earnings per share. As stated earlier, earnings for the first quarter were $2.05 per share, an increase of 10.8%. Margin expansion net of organic sales declines contributed $0.04 to earnings in the quarter. First year acquisitions and divestitures added $0.07 to earnings per share. This result was driven by solid performances from Membrana, Capital Safety and Ivera along with divestiture gains in the quarter. Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduced pretax earnings by $48 million or the equivalent of $0.05 a share. Higher balance sheet leverage led to an increase in net interest expense year-on-year, reducing per share earnings by $0.02. The first quarter tax rate was 26.8% versus 29.5% in the comparable quarter, which increased Q1 earnings by $0.07 per share. The lower Q1 tax rate includes the adoption of a new FASB accounting standard, which I will walk through in a moment. Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined by 4% year-on-year, which added $0.09 to first quarter earnings per share. Please turn to Slide 8. On March 30 of this year, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standards\u2019 update related to employee share based payments. This new standard changes the recording of additional tax savings or charges when employees realize benefits from stock based compensation. The additional tax impact is a result of the change in the value of stock based compensation, from the time it is granted to an employee to the time it is realized by the employee. Previously these additional tax impacts were recognized in the equity section on the balance sheet. Going forward, it will be recognized on the income statement. All U.S. public companies are required to adopt the new accounting standard no later than the 2017 fiscal year. We chose to adopt this new standard in the first quarter of 2016, which created a first quarter tax benefit of $0.10 per share, net of tax costs related to global cash optimization actions. For the full year, we expect no impact to our tax rate and earnings per share guidance as additional actions we chose to implement to further optimize our global cash position will increase our tax expense in the last three quarters of the year. Let\u2019s now turn to our first quarter cash flow performance on Slide 9. Overall, we posted another solid cash flow performance in Q1. Free cash flow conversion was 74%, up 8 percentage points versus the same period last year. As a reminder, Q1 is typically our lowest conversion rate of the year. We generated $1.3 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, $180 million increase versus Q1 in 2015. The primary drivers of the increase were improved inventories and accounts receivable, along with lower cash taxes. Capital expenditures were $314 million as we continued to invest in the business to drive efficient growth. For the full year, we expect CapEx investments in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. The strength of our business model allows us to invest in growth and also return cash to shareholders. As you heard earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 8%, which increased our payout to $672 million in the quarter. In addition to dividends, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through gross share repurchases. Let\u2019s now review our first quarter performance on a business by business basis. Please go to Slide 10. Our Industrial business group posted quarterly sales of $2.6 billion. First quarter organic growth in our Industrial business was down 1.9%, with mid single-digit declines in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. As mentioned earlier, the U.S. Industrial production index was down 1.3% in the first quarter, which impacted parts of our Industrial business. Our advanced materials business declined low double-digits, impacted by ongoing weakness in the oil and gas end market. Conversely, our automotive OEM business grew high single-digits, continuing its strong track record of outpacing global car and light truck builds. We also posted positive organic growth in our automotive aftermarket business in the quarter. The acquisition of Membrana net of the Polyfoam divestiture, added 1.9% to Industrial sales growth. We are pleased with the smooth integration of Membrana into 3M and the business continues to exceed its financial performance objectives. Industrial increased its margins 150 basis points to 23.9%, posting operating income of $617 million. Please turn to Slide 11. First quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were up 2.4% organically to $1.4 billion. Commercial solutions delivered solid organic growth with particular strength in Latin America and the U.S. Personal safety, one of our Heartland businesses also had a good quarter of organic growth led by EMEA and Asia Pacific. Our roofing granules business also posted strong growth in the quarter. Acquisitions net of divestitures added 4.5 percentage points to sales growth in the quarter. This result includes Capital Safety, along with the impact from the divestitures of library systems and the license plate converting business in France. Geographically, organic growth in Safety and Graphics was broad based, paced by a mid single-digit increase in Asia Pacific. Operating income for the business was $345 million and operating margins were a solid 24.5%. Please turn to Slide 12. Our Health Care business delivered an outstanding quarter from top to bottom. The business generated sales of $1.4 billion and led our company\u2019s organic growth at 6.2%. Growth was broad based, with all businesses and geographic areas up mid single-digits or greater year-on-year. Health Information Systems and Food Safety both posted strong double-digit growth in the quarter and our medical consumables and oral care businesses each delivered solid mid single-digit growth in Q1. The Ivera Medical acquisition added 90 basis points to first quarter sales growth year-on-year. This business is performing very well and exceeding its financial performance objectives. Our Health Care business delivered 13% organic growth in developing markets in the quarter, with particular strength in China-Hong Kong, Mexico and Russia. Operating income was $455 million, up 12% versus last year\u2019s first quarter and margins were strong at 32.9%. As you can see from this quarter\u2019s results, our Health Care business continued its track record of strong performance. And as Inge mentioned we are increasing investments across the business to drive efficient growth into the future. Next, let\u2019s cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 13. First quarter sales in Electronics and Energy were $1.1 billion, down 11.7% organically and in line with what we communicated at our March Investor Day. On the electronics side of the business, organic sales were down 18%. The decline was due to a combination of factors including soft end market demand, elevated channel inventory and a challenging year-on-year comparison. Our team remains focused on increasing relevance with customers and driving spec-in wins to deliver organic growth as the industry improves. Our energy related businesses were down 1% organically, with growth in electrical markets being offset by declines in Telcom as well as Renewable Energy. As a reminder, in last year\u2019s Q4, we took portfolio actions within the Renewable Energy business. These actions negatively impacted Q1 organic growth, but have improved profitability in this business. Within Electrical Markets, our ACCR overhead conductor business posted strong double-digit growth. On a geographic basis, organic growth was down double-digits in Asia-Pacific, where our Electronics business is concentrated. First quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $208 million, with margins of 18.2%, down 330 basis points largely volume-related. Looking towards the full year, we now expect Electronics and Energy to decline organically in the low to mid single-digit range. As Inge mentioned, we are taking actions in the second quarter to further position the business for long-term success. I will finish with our consumer business on Slide 14. Consumer had another solid quarter, with sales of $1 billion and organic growth increasing 2.8% year-on-year. Sales grew organically in three of our four businesses led by Home Improvement and Consumer Health Care. Across the bottom of this slide, you see just a few of the market leading brands that are powering our consumer portfolio. Within the Home Improvement business, our Command Damage Free mounting products posted strong double-digit growth as accelerated investments continue to payoff. ScotchBlue Painter\u2019s Tape and Filtrete filters also delivered strong growth in the quarter. Our Consumer Health Care business posted solid first quarter organic growth as the growing trend of active lifestyles continue to drive strong demand for our ACE and FUTURO braces and support products. Geographically, organic growth was paced by Asia-Pacific, driven by double-digit growth in China/Hong Kong, along with solid mid single-digit growth in the U.S. Operating income was $238 million, with operating margins of 22.7% both similar to last year\u2019s first quarter. On Slide 15, we are reaffirming our 2016 planning estimates. We estimate earnings in the range of $8.10 to $8.45 per share, an increase of 7% to 11% year-over-year. Organic growth is expected to be up 1% to 3%, with acquisitions net of divestitures adding 1% of sales. We estimate that foreign currency translation will reduce sales by 1% to 3%. Finally, our tax rate is still expected to be 29.5% to 30.5%, with free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%. With that, I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Joe.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Maybe let\u2019s \u2013 maybe just starting off on Electronics since that seemed to be like the biggest, I guess, surprise in the quarter at least from our perspective. Can you talk a little bit about your expectations and the cadence for the remainder of the year just particularly in light of some of the commentary regarding slower smartphone shipments? So, that\u2019s kind of the near-term question. And the longer term question is maybe we can talk about this in the context of your portfolio, Inge, you have done a lot to restructure your portfolio since you took over. I am just curious like whether this is a business that you are going to continue to reevaluate as we move forward?\nInge Thulin: Well, good morning, Joe. Well, first of all, it was a little bit \u2013 the slowest business for us in the quarter, but not much of a surprise if you go back and think about our Investor Day when we talked about it in terms of what we expected for the first quarter. Now the electronic part was down 18%, which was I would say is all based on a weaker near-term demand in terms of consumer electronics. So, from that perspective not a surprise for us, but I think as we look out for the next quarter, we have to expect in the second quarter mid to high single growth down. And I think for the year, low to mid single. So, I think that\u2019s how you have to think about the business group. And I will say that in terms of the portfolio, this is a very, very good business for us, because we have all the components in order for us to be competitive in this marketplace and we have worked on that business in order to be more relevant now for 4 years. And as you can see, here in this quarter, we take some more actions in order to line up our business model versus what is required in that business. So, I will say, first of all, all businesses, portfolio management is an ongoing process. We look upon that the whole time. But the fundamentals for us to be in this business is very, very good and very, very strong is just that we have to adjust as we go and on the fly and I think that\u2019s what we are doing here again, right. But for me and for us, it\u2019s more a near-term weaker demand in consumer electronics as we speak.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, fair enough. And maybe my second question and turning it to the Health Care group where you saw accelerating organic growth, the margin is now approaching 33%. Maybe talk a little bit about the expectations for that business now. Have they been ratcheted up at all as we progress through the year and should we start thinking about this business as being a 32% to 33% type margin business moving forward?\nInge Thulin: Well, first of all, you are correct relative to the performance of Health Care over many, many years, right. This is a very good business for us and very solid fundamentals. And I think it\u2019s very much based on the value creation for both the providers and the patient in that market. We will \u2013 you saw this quarter again very solid organic local currency growth, margin expansion, and is broad-based. It\u2019s both in developed and developing markets and you have seen all businesses. And we will now continue to accelerate that investment as we move ahead. So, it\u2019s not only health information systems that we decided to keep in our portfolio investing is we will invest in all the businesses. And as I laid out, it is around research and development, it\u2019s about health economics, and it\u2019s about commercialization capabilities. Those three things in the combination is very, very powerful for us. And think about it as well in terms of developed versus developing. Our position is very strong in the developed world and we continue to take market share and we penetrate even deeper there. In developing, the field starts to open up for us, because key opinion leaders are recommending our protocols, including our products around the world. So, we have a very strong position there. And you can think about this in terms of our fastest growing business with the highest margin and we are pleased with the margins, but we are not \u2013 we will accelerate the investment there to get growth up even further.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, great. Thanks, Inge.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: Good morning. Just a question firstly on Industrial and Safety and Graphics, if you have seen any change in demand trends as you went through the quarter in China and in developed markets?\nNick Gangestad: Julian, good morning. For both China and in U.S. and in Europe, as the quarter went on, we saw no discernible change in the trends. It was a pretty consistent performance throughout the quarter.\nJulian Mitchell: Got it. Thank you very much.\nInge Thulin: Yes, the comment on China, we saw again both Consumer and Health Care with very solid growth in China in this quarter. So, that\u2019s again a good indication relative to what is happening in those markets as they are type of expanding their businesses specifically in China. They are not shifting, but they are expanding into more domestic driven businesses. And we saw terrific growth, both in consumer and Health Care in China.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks. And then just my second moment beyond Electronics and Energy, if you are seeing any price pressure there or it\u2019s all just volume declines. And also you talked about some portfolio changes recently, should we expect therefore that the energy related business could grow this year, actually within that segment?\nNick Gangestad: Julian, first on the price front, we haven\u2019t seen any change in the trajectory on pricing. It\u2019s been pretty flat as it was last year and into this year. No real changes on the pricing, selling price environment that we are seeing on the electronics side. In regards to portfolio movement actions, as I said on the energy side, we took a portfolio action within our renewable energy business in the fourth quarter, which is having a negative impact on our first quarter organic growth. That negative impact will continue throughout all four quarters of 2016 and it\u2019s incorporated into our guidance for the total business and the company.\nJulian Mitchell: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Winoker: Thanks and good morning all.\nInge Thulin: Thanks Steven.\nSteven Winoker: Could you maybe just talk a little bit about the pricing raw material dynamic in terms of how that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s still huge even though it\u2019s diminishing, what are your expectations for that going forward and as part of that, how much of that pricing was currency related this quarter?\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Steve. For the first quarter the combination of price raw material, that benefited our margin by 110 basis points. The vast majority of that coming from lower raw material prices. And on the raw materials side, we are continuing to expect our tailwinds, driven by lower commodity prices and with a heavier weighting to the first half of the year than the second half. Regarding selling prices, we have traditionally been able to achieve about 30 basis points of underlying price growth when we strip out FX. We continue to see that as our capability and we project that we will be at that type of core price growth in our company for the year. If I look at the price growth that we had in the first quarter of 90 basis points, all of that came in our international operations and the majority of that 90 basis points was in response to our pricing actions in response to FX movements, the majority of that 90 basis points coming from FX reaction.\nSteven Winoker: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then in terms of the M&A that you have done Capital Safety, etcetera, what was the organic growth of those businesses, what were they achieving from an organic basis?\nNick Gangestad: On an organic basis, well first of all, I will just level set the facts here that what they are adding to 3M\u2019s total growth, our total acquisitions before divestitures added 2.1% to 3M\u2019s growth and our divestitures reduced 3M\u2019s revenue by 50 basis points. So we had a net 160 basis points growth. Underlying that within our Capital Safety business organically, we continued to see strong revenue performance across the board for that business, with the exception of the oil and gas market that the Capital Safety market serves. In our Membrana business, that business continues to perform well. But from an organic basis, we typically start measuring the organic once we lapped ourselves 12 months after we acquired it, Steve.\nSteven Winoker: No, I know. I am just looking for what the actual \u2013 what they are running at organically so that when they do lap 12 months, which should be in the third quarter, how much it\u2019s going to add, that\u2019s we are going to trying get to?\nNick Gangestad: Low single-digits would be our best estimate right now.\nSteven Winoker: Okay, fantastic. And if I could just one last, you guys holding the 1% to 3%, what are you actually taking up since Electronics and Energy are down?\nInge Thulin: We are not changing our guidance at this point in time.\nSteven Winoker: Right, so there must be some other business that\u2019s higher, I guess?\nInge Thulin: Yes, correct.\nNick Gangestad: Yes. Steve, we continue to see our other four businesses solidly in the range that we laid out in December and they will help propel our company to the guidance we put out of 1% to 3%.\nSteven Winoker: Fantastic. Thank you.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Hi, good morning guys.\nInge Thulin: Good morning Scott.\nScott Davis: Can you give us a sense, I mean Inge you talked about China a little bit, but can you walk around the world and just talk about what\u2019s getting better or what\u2019s getting worse out there and geographically?\nInge Thulin: I don\u2019t think since we met at Investor Day that there being any big changes in the marketplaces. With maybe one slight exception which is Europe, Middle East, Africa. I think that\u2019s, honestly was a little bit of surprise that we saw slightly better growth there than we had expected. I think that\u2019s the change that from a material perspective, if you like, that have changed. That on the positive side, because I think we have to look for positive sides within Latin America, we had \u2013 we continue very good growth in Mexico, but we were positive in Brazil as well. So I think Brazil then by definition is one country. I think that\u2019s something that we could see changing. But more than that, I don\u2019t see any change. Central Europe, East Europe is doing well. West Europe was actually, as I have said a slight surprise. Nothing changed in Asia, nothing changed for us in the United States either. So I think it was very solid and no absolute downs in terms of, I think specifically that was negative that came after as I see it, there were some slight positives, if you like.\nScott Davis: Okay. I know this is hard to dial down to this kind of detail, but when you think about the 150 basis points full year guide on margins, how much of that are you guys thinking as price cost?\nNick Gangestad: Price for raw materials Scott, we for the year, we have been expecting that to be 50 basis points and we still see ourselves lining up closely with that.\nScott Davis: Okay. And just a quick one, is your price now fully caught up to currency dislocations in 3M?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. Going forward, where the dollar is right now, I think the majority of our price increases due to FX are behind us especially as the dollar stays where it is.\nScott Davis: Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you, guys.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Inch: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nInge Thulin: Good morning John.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning John.\nJohn Inch: Good morning guys. Hi Inge, your history of being able to raise pricing 30 basis points a year may not help you much if these raw costs, metals, gas, oil keep climbing the way they do, you put up very impressive margins, I am just \u2013 what\u2019s your play book for offsetting a potential margin squeeze if you could draw on history and your own thoughts towards being able to raise pricing more than you have in your history to offset some of these cost increases that seem to be about to hit us all?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. John, I will take that one. The 30 basis points is when we look over a long period of time of what our capability has been. And it\u2019s been fairly sustainable. In times of commodity price increases that tends to go up slightly, in times of commodity price declines that tends to go down. But it\u2019s fairly constant within 3M. To answer your question John, I would like to take you back to our Investor Day. As we look to the next few years of where we will be driving our efficient growth and potential for margin expansion, we are really driving many of our initiatives to be able to do that. Our initiatives around business transformation, one of our key levers, actions we are taking with our footprint to better optimize our efficiency and effectiveness of our manufacturing supply chain. That I see is the heart of what we will be doing in the coming years to continue our ability to grow efficiently and part of that involves margin expansion.\nJohn Inch: Okay. So you basically, Nick, are saying that it\u2019s highly probable you are going to get behind on raw costs versus price increases, but there is just ample productivity within 3M and you are taking more restructuring obviously in E&E that you feel good about just being able to offset it. Is that kind of it?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, I am not \u2013 I think I am not ready to say and I don\u2019t think it would be accurate to say that we see ourselves flipping over to the negative on the price raws, but it has been a noticeable benefit to us for the last 2 plus years. We are not planning for it to be as positive for us as it has been and we are relying more on other productivity initiatives to fuel our efficiency and our growth.\nJohn Inch: That\u2019s fair. I am just trying to get ahead of this. Second question is really on your own guidance had, if I am not mistaken, assume that the economy generally, loosely defined I guess the industrial economy was going to meaningfully pick up in the second half? Your industrial and E&E numbers are not \u2013 is showing that. Parker\u2019s numbers are actually, their orders are worse. There is a very mixed reporting season in terms of the economy cadence, right. China is good, but I am talking kind of North America and other points. Inge, are you still holding to the fact that you think numbers can get better in the second half? I realize you got a lot of margin embedded, so that\u2019s I am not so worried about your numbers. I just want your commentary around your thoughts for the U.S. industrial economy?\nInge Thulin: Yes, we do. I think that we look upon our total portfolio, right. As I said earlier, this change we see is the weaker near-term demand in consumer electronics and maybe that it will persist a little bit longer than we thought. So, if you take that as a given that is the change, I would say, but we see in Industrial that, that model is still working for us and we are sticking to the plan as we go for the year. And three of that are businesses will compensate for what I will say a delay of the growth rate coming in the second part for electronics part of our business. So, there is no change down. I don\u2019t see that change coming either to be honest. I have not seen that as of yet. I see there is a slight strength, actually, coming both for Safety and Graphics, Consumer and Health Care and Industrial stay very much as we laid out as we met the last time and then it looked like that there will be a little bit longer persistent in the consumer electronic part as we thought just 2 months ago also.\nJohn Inch: That\u2019s right. So, in other words, Industrial are flat and other businesses are doing a little bit better. One last thing, Nick, this accounting change, you say you are basically going to offset it with I am assuming cash repatriation on which you pay taxes. How does that \u2013 does that like you give a sense of how that\u2019s going to breakout over the next three quarters? And if you don\u2019t do that, have you actually given yourselves somewhat favorably a $0.10 tailwind? Well, I guess it\u2019s the accounting change, but does this accounting change create a $0.10 tailwind heading into \u201817 because you may not repatriate for whatever next year, so that\u2019s just how the math works?\nNick Gangestad: John, a couple of points on that. As far as the actions we are taking to optimize our global cash position, I don\u2019t want you to think of it as a one-time event. This is a continuation of ongoing efforts we do in our company to efficiently and effectively manage our cash positions. And as you look at our balance sheet, our amount of our global cash has been declining. And we are always looking for how we can move cash to improve our efficiency and effectiveness as well as reduce the risk in holding that cash. It\u2019s been an ongoing effort. We are going to continue to do it. It did give us an opportunity to take some actions and repatriation, John, as part of that. In terms of setting up another $0.10 tailwind into 2017, I think that would be going too far. I think it continues to position us well for \u201817, but I wouldn\u2019t think of it all as a tailwind going into \u201817.\nJohn Inch: But is the $0.10 equally spread I know for the next three quarters in your tax line, Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, John, it is. Over the next three quarters, we expect to average approximately a 31% tax rate. But as you know and as you look at our results, there is fluctuation. Some quarters will be higher and some lower, but over the next three quarters, averaging around 31%.\nJohn Inch: Okay, got it. Thanks very much.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Good morning guys.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Andrew.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: So, if you look at your breakdown of price you look at the U.S. pricing, you didn\u2019t get any price in the U.S. this quarter. You got 0.6 last quarter and really you have averaged that usual 30 to 50 basis points over the last year in the U.S. Are you seeing any more competition in the U.S.? Is there any more of an issue in any particular segment in the U.S.? Did something change that it might get tougher to get your usual 30 to 50 basis points in the U.S.?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Andy, I will take that one. We are not seeing a big change. There are certain parts of our business in the U.S. where we continue to face good competition and we react with price, but I would call those pockets, not widespread. Sometimes with pricing, in particular in the U.S., we saw actions to capture more market share and adjust pricing. And that\u2019s part of what\u2019s leading to that 0% that we posted in price in the U.S. for the first quarter.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Nick, do you think you could still average that 30 to 50 as you go over the next year or?\nNick Gangestad: Of underlying price capability...\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Yes, in the U.S.\nNick Gangestad: We still see that 30 basis points as a good reflection of our underlying capability there.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Got it. And Inge, if I could ask you again about Safety and Graphics, I mean, it picked up nicely in 1Q in terms of growth versus 4Q, but we know you had a very difficult comp in 4Q. So, did you actually see a pickup in personal safety or was it mostly just easier comps working their magic and how do we look at this business going forward?\nInge Thulin: Yes. No, we saw a pickup in personal safety. So, I think you have to look upon it in a couple of ways. First of all, if you think about your position in the market, when you add an acquisition like Capital Safety, you will strengthen your position big time in that whole personal safety space. So, I will say that in my view this is only the beginning of something big that will come for us, because our relevance in that whole personal safety segmentation has increased very, very much. And so I will say there is clear evidence for us that we moved our positions forward and that \u2013 so it\u2019s not based on easier comp only. That was an easier comp. But we can also see we start to take better positions both for respirators and now for protection.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Inge, maybe its better market share even than better market, is that fair?\nInge Thulin: Sorry.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Is it better market than improved market, is that fair?\nInge Thulin: Market share, yes, market share, but you have also to look upon it in terms of segmentation that you expand with Capital Safety and as you expand for 3M, expand with Capital Safety, some \u2013 of course, all of our other product portfolios is going with that. So, we are becoming much stronger in that position totally. That business there in Safety and Graphics that is doing very, very well for us is Commercial Solutions that again showed 4% organic local currency growth and have now for many, many quarters, really, really performed well for us.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Thanks.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nInge Thulin: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: For Nick, it seemed that the dollar is now beginning to be less of a headwind for you guys. Would you consider changing or ramping back your hedging plans? If I recall you had moved from a 12-month to a 24-month hedging maybe that\u2019s not as required at this stage, have you given that some thought?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Dean, thanks for the question. The short answer is no, but a little longer answer is our hedging philosophy is meant to help us reduce some of our volatility and allow time for the businesses to adjust to a sustained change in currencies. It\u2019s not to eliminate all the risk. And our objective there, we use oftentimes natural hedges and when we can\u2019t do that then we use financial hedges to offset some of that risk. Our strategy of using hedging and we hedge approximately 50% of that exposure, most currencies out 1 year and then a few selected currencies out second year and third year. That philosophy isn\u2019t changing. We are going to continue to do that. And it really lines up with our philosophy of how we think about hedging over time to help take some of that risk and give our businesses time to react.\nDeane Dray: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And Nick were there be divestiture gains in the quarter?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, there were. There we \u2013 we divested of our Polyfoam business during the first quarter and of the $0.07 related to M&A, approximately one half of that $0.07 was coming from gains on divestitures.\nDeane Dray: Got it. And then for the charge expected in the second quarter, that\u2019s all headcount related, the payback on that, what\u2019s the expected payback on that charge?\nNick Gangestad: We expect that charge to pay for itself by the end of this year.\nDeane Dray: And do you contemplate other actions in electronics over the near-term?\nInge Thulin: No, not at this point in time, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Okay. Thank you.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning gentlemen. Just a quick follow-up on the sort of $0.03 Nick from gains, where did that land, was that in the segment?\nNick Gangestad: Nigel, the Polyfoam business is in our Industrial business. And that resulted in about half, approximately approaching half of that $0.07 benefit that we saw for the total company. By the way, it was also part of the overall guidance when we guided for the year, that we expected $0.10 of benefits from M&A. The sale of our Polyfoam business was included in that estimate.\nNigel Coe: Okay, that\u2019s very clear. Thanks. And then it seems that showed us to pick on margins just given the overall strength in margins, but they were down 20 bps and you have given the tailwinds from pension and growth, it does look and I see there is higher upsides in there, but is there mix there, is there the pricing, can you maybe add a bit more color on Consumer margins this quarter?\nNick Gangestad: Nigel, the primary thing you are seeing there is that we continue to see good opportunities in our consumer business. And we are investing for continued growth. So it\u2019s some key investments that we are choosing to make now that we think will propel this into even stronger position in the future.\nNigel Coe: Okay. And then I know in the business you are giving quarterly guidance, but your comments around 1Q back in January were very helpful and getting our models balanced, so I am just wondering if maybe you could add some color on 2Q, how you see organic sales developing into 2Q?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. For the second quarter, we do see organic growth being slightly better than what we saw in Q1 for the total company. And we are also continuing to estimate that the second half is going to be stronger than the first half. In particular, in Electronics and Energy, we are expecting that second quarter organic growth is going to be a decline in the mid to high single-digits. So it will go from approximately 12% decline in the first quarter to a mid to high single-digit decline in the second quarter. And then for the year we are expecting Electronics and Energy to be down low to mid single-digits.\nNigel Coe: Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nInge Thulin: Good morning Jeff.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning Jeff.\nJeffrey Sprague: Good morning. Just a couple of really quick ones, just on tax planning, Nick, obviously you have had an aspiration to drive your tax rate down, my sense is a lot of that\u2019s been the hubs and [indiscernible] and other thing. But is there anything on what the Treasury recently pronounced that kind of thwarts your ambitions to bring the tax rate down over the next couple of years?\nNick Gangestad: Jeff no, the recent actions being taken there do not thwart our efforts to bring us to a 27% tax rate by 2020. We are continuing to evaluate those proposals and the impact they could have on 3M, but we don\u2019t contemplate that they would have a material impact on us at this time.\nJeffrey Sprague: And then just a quick one on Health Care, was R&D actually up in the quarter, I ask that in that R&D was actually down overall for the company, so the comments about increased investment, is that more about ambition and outlook for the rest of the year or does R&D actually moving up in Health Care in the first quarter?\nInge Thulin: Well, first of all, when we say we will accelerate our investments in terms of both R&D, hence economics and commercialization. That is when we move forward. Our intent on the company level in order to accelerate investment in R&D is happening, right. The 5.5% we are close to 6% at this point in time. So we are moving forward. And we are moving forward in all groups we say. So the answer is yes and acceleration will happen in Health Care specifically.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O\u2019Callaghan of UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nShannon O\u2019Callaghan: Good morning guys.\nInge Thulin: Good morning.\nShannon O\u2019Callaghan: Hey, Inge, Health Care and consumer, two businesses you have been trying to grow more in developing market from their historic position, you highlighted both the growth in developing market for both in this quarter, I am just wondering if you feel like you are reaching some kind of a tipping point there or maybe just a little bit of what you are seeing going on there?\nInge Thulin: Tipping point in terms of more growth coming?\nShannon O\u2019Callaghan: In terms of more developing market traction for consumer and Healthcare?\nInge Thulin: Yes. I think both are strengthening their positions. And the way we should think about this is in terms of the acceleration of growth, by definition will go faster in Health Care than in consumer. And the reason for that is everything you have to do around brand equity in consumer take a little bit longer time. So when you compare the two of them, we will see a faster acceleration for Health Care versus consumer. But both of them are growing very, very well. And I would not say that in terms of outcome, yes, we see both of them coming stronger now than versus a year ago. But we have been on this for quite some time. And it\u2019s often realization of change of brand equity position for consumer. And then it\u2019s a question about money availability for Health Care. So our solutions are very advanced and is very much driven based on health economics. And as countries get bigger budget and can spend more into Health Care, they are shifting from less advanced solution to solutions like 3M can provide. So that\u2019s what we believe, that both Health Care and consumer has great future for us in that part of the world. And as you look upon our mix, those are also two of our businesses that mix in the portfolio, that we have less penetration and less sales in developing versus developed market for those two businesses. So the future look good, it\u2019s up to us now to execute and do that as fast as possible.\nShannon O\u2019Callaghan: Okay, great. And just maybe some comments on what the M&A pipeline looks like until we lacked anything of size this year?\nInge Thulin: It looks good. All business groups have a good pipeline. We are constantly looking into that. I would say that when you think about what we have done the last year that you saw we did fewer, but more sizable versus the past and very strategically relative to our portfolio, that is what you should expect from 3M going forward.\nShannon O\u2019Callaghan: Okay, thanks.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Tusa: Hey guys. Good morning.\nInge Thulin: Good morning Steve.\nSteve Tusa: So thanks for the revenue color on the second quarter there. I guess the moving parts kind of sequentially with tax going up obviously and then you have the charge I guess which is going to flow through Electronics and Energy, so a normal seasonality would get you to something in kind of a 2.10 to 2.15 range, I would assume that these items bring you perhaps a little bit lower than that given what you pulled into the first quarter, is that kind of the right way to think about it. And then just the margin, year-over-year margin, I guess another way to ask the question would be what are the major differences in the year-over-year margin bridge given that the utilization and other should probably still be with you, you have the extra restructuring. Just maybe a little bit of color on the bottom line dynamics to help size us for the second quarter?\nNick Gangestad: Okay. So, for the second quarter, Steve, I have shared much about the second quarter already. I would say about what we are expecting for total growth in Electronics and Energy, you noted the charge we are taking in our Electronics and Energy business. I think the only other thing on the margin I will point out is corporate and unallocated, I have guided that we expect that to be between $150 million and $200 million for the year first quarter right in line with that. As we look at the seasonality, we expect a corporate and unallocated for the year. We think that will stay right in that range. I do see Q2 as the highest quarter for our expense we will be incurring in corporate and unallocated and then moderating going into Q3 and Q4. In regards to margin for Q2, as it look Q2 and for the total year, Steve, FX and raw materials are a couple of things that are a little better than how we started the year thinking. And though I see those partially offsetting what we are seeing from lower utilization of our electronics and industrial assets in the first half of the year.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. So year-over-year, a little bit of a better lift on margins in the second quarter is what you are saying?\nNick Gangestad: As I look at our total guidance for the year, we expect margins up about 150 basis points. We were at $130 million in the first quarter. As I look across the whole year, fourth quarter is, Steve, where we expect the most margin expansion where we had the restructuring charge in fourth quarter of last year. The second and third quarter I would put below the mean for the year for margin expansion.\nSteve Tusa: Below the mean for the year. Okay, got it. So, can you get this, I mean, I think I am kind of walking these moving parts down. I mean, it seems like there is something roughly around $2. Is that kind of the right area for you guys?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. Steve, we give guidance for the year, $8.10 to $8.45 is the right guidance for the year. I am not going to try to guide the EPS for the quarter.\nSteve Tusa: Okay, I had to try. Thanks a lot.\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLaurence Alexander: Good morning. I guess two longer term questions on the Electronics and Energy segment. Are you happy with the prospects for accelerating growth through better R&D the same way as you expressed on Health Care? And then related to that as you look at the longer term strategic options for those businesses, are your options constrained by the degree to which our R&D backbone across the business is integrated, so that you don\u2019t want to source an IP to exit the company that might affect the other segments?\nInge Thulin: Well, let\u2019s start with the first question. In a way, they are maybe related, right. So, you are talking about research and development, investment into that business and so forth. The advantage in that business is if you think about the Electronics, very much of that is spec-ins right. So, we work direct with our customers in order to make sure we find solutions for them. That\u2019s actually a very powerful model if you think about it. So, we have two processes in the company, one called Idea 2 Innovation, i2i, which is more for consumables and then you have customer inspired innovation, which is a model where you work direct with one specific customer. So, if that is in aerospace, that is in automotive, if that\u2019s consumer electronics or wherever that it is right into one specific customer. The strengths of that model is that you know exactly the outcome of that model. You don\u2019t work on something that is broad-based from a market perspective that eventually will take place. You know it will take place in this customer inspired innovation. And if you don\u2019t come to a solution, you kill it very early. So, I am very confident in that model and that is why that is a very good business from 3M, because we can provide through our technology platforms multiple solutions that will generate better and more competitive products for our customers. So, the answer to that is very confident in the research and development into that model. And we can adjust of course based on what they are requiring. So, that\u2019s an important element on the Electronic side. On the Energy side, it\u2019s a model that we are using in the normal industrial production or in consumer, etcetera, where you have a bigger market space that you need to serve and when you get the input from customer panels, etcetera. So, the business is always built on research and development and that is the heartbeat of 3M. That is also why we are able to generate very good returns to our investors, because we are not commoditized. We don\u2019t work with those customers in order to replace something that is already in their devices today. We try to move it to the next level together with them. That is the power of it.\nLaurence Alexander: Okay, thank you.\nInge Thulin: Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for some closing comments.\nInge Thulin: To wrap up, we had a strong start to the year highlighted by good earnings, margins and cash flow. Going forward, we will continue to execute the 3M playbook to drive efficient growth and create even greater value for customers and shareholders. Thank you for joining us and we look forward to talking to you very soon. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the 3M Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, January 25, 2018. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2017 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President, and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our 2018 investor events. Please turn to Slide 2. This year's earnings conference calls will be held on April 24, July 24 and October 23. Please take a moment to read our forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Finally, please that throughout today's presentation we'll be making references to non-GAAP financial measures, including measures which exclude the impact of the tax cuts and Jobs Act. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of today's presentation and press release. Please turn to Slide 4 and I'll hand it off to Inge. Inge?\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Bruce and good morning, everyone. I will open with some comments on the fourth quarter and later in the call I will recap our full year performance. 3M had a strong finish to 2017 delivering robust organic growth across all business groups and all geographic areas. We posted record sales and expanded our profitability while continuing to invest in the business. Looking at the numbers, we increased to $2.10 per share, up 12% year-on-year. Note, that this excludes the impact of tax reform recently enacted in the United States which Nick will discuss in detail. Our team delivered total sales of $8 billion, an all-time high for the fourth quarter. Organic growth company-wide was a strong 6% as our fundamental strength are enabling us to capitalize on an improving global economy. This includes very good performance from Electronics & Energy and Safety & Graphics, both of which grew 11% organically. Organic growth in our consumer business accelerated to 5%, its third consecutive quarter of positive growth. Industrial grew 4% organically and healthcare grew 3%. Organic growth was also broad-based across geographic areas led by Asia-Pacific at 12% and Europe, Middle East, Africa at 7%. The United States and Latin America, Canada each grew 3% organically. Turning to margins; our team executed well and expended margins to a healthy 23% with four of our five business groups above 22%. We also continue to invest in the business including research and development in CapEx while returning significant cash to our shareholders. In the quarter we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. That concludes my opening remarks, and I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick?\nNicholas Gangestad: Thank you, Inge. Let me begin with a topic that is top of mind this earning season; the tax cuts and Jobs Act, and its impact on our fourth quarter results and beyond. Please turn to Slide 5; following the passage of the new tax legislation we recorded a net tax expense in Q4 of $762 million or $1.25 per share resulting in fourth quarter GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share. This net tax expense includes the onetime transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings, as well as true-ups of tax deferred assets and liabilities. Excluding this impact fourth quarter earnings were $2.10 per share, an increase of 12% year-on-year. In addition, as a result of tax reform we now expect our 2018 tax rate to be between 20% and 22% versus the prior range of 26% to 27%. Inge will provide more details on our updated 2018 guidance later in the call. Please note, that the balance of my prepared remarks today will exclude the impact of U.S. tax reform on 2017 earnings. Please turn to Slide 6 to review fourth quarter sales. Sales growth remained strong in Q4, up 6% organically as we continue to outperform the markets we serve. Selling prices continue to improve throughout the year with fourth quarter up 20 basis points. Excluding our electronics businesses, selling prices were up 40 basis points; our strongest quarterly pricing performance in 2017. The combination of acquisitions and divestitures contributed 30 basis points to sales growth in the quarter. This impact relates to the fourth quarter acquisition of Scott Safety, net of the divestiture of non-strategic businesses over the last 12 months. In addition, foreign currency translation increased sales by 2.7 percentage points. All in, fourth quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 9% versus last year. In the U.S. organic growth increased 3% with all business groups delivering positive growth. Growth was led by high single digit increases in both, Safety & Graphics and Electronics & Energy followed by consumer of mid-single digits. Asia-Pacific led the company with organic growth of 12% in Q4. All business groups within Asia-Pacific posted strong growth in the quarter led by double-digit increases in Safety & Graphics, Electronics & Energy and healthcare. Organic growth was 18% in China/Hong Kong, and 7% in Japan. Excluding Electronics, China/Hong Kong grew 19% and Japan was up 5%. Moving to EMEA; organic growth was 7% in Q4 with West Europe up 5%. All business groups grew in the quarter with Safety & Graphics and Consumer leading growth in the area. Finally, Q4 organic growth in Latin America/Canada was 3% led by a mid-single digit growth in consumer, industrial and healthcare. At a country level, Canada delivered strong organic growth of 8% while Mexico and Brazil were both up 3%. Please turn to Slide 7 for the fourth quarter P&L highlights. Companywide fourth quarter sales were $8 billion with operating income of $1.8 billion, up 9.4%. On a GAAP basis fourth quarter operating margins were 22.8% or 23.8% adjusting for year-on-year impacts from M&A, strategic investments and divestiture gains. Let's take a closer look at the various components of our margin performance in the fourth quarter. Leverage on organic volume growth and productivity contributed 150 basis points to operating margins. Acquisitions and divestitures combined brought down margins by a net 60 basis points, this result includes a 90 basis point impact related to the Scott Safety acquisition which closed in early Q4. The combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices added 40 basis points to operating margins. Foreign currency, net of hedging impacts reduced margins by 60 basis points and higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense decreased margins by 20 basis points. Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at earnings per share. Fourth quarter earnings were $2.10 per share, up 12% year-over-year. The benefits from organic growth and productivity were the predominant driver of earnings growth, contributing $0.33 to per share earnings in the quarter. On our October earnings call we described four items that would impact the fourth quarter, each of them came in as expected with per share earnings headwind of $0.07 from the acquisition of Scott Safety, $0.06 from incremental strategic investments and $0.11 from our high coupon debt tender while we recorded a benefit of $0.12 from the divestiture of the electronic monitoring business. In addition, there are two other items that I would like to comment on that impacted fourth quarter earnings. First, we updated our reserves for future potential respirator mask claims that we estimate could occur over the next several decades which resulted in a $0.07 year-on-year earnings headwind. Secondly, our Q4 tax rate was 23% versus 28.2% in the prior year which increased earnings by $0.13 per share. The lower tax rate was driven by increasing benefits from our supply chain centers of expertise, geographic profit mix and equity-based compensation. Please turn to Slide 9 for a look at our cash flow performance. Fourth quarter free cash flow was $1.4 billion with free cash flow conversion of 268%. Included in these results is the impact of the tax cuts and Jobs Act along with a U.S. pension contribution of $600 million that we made following the signing of tax reform. The net impact of these two items benefited Q4 free cash flow conversion by 112 percentage points. For the full year free cash flow conversion was 100% with a 3 percentage point benefit from tax reform, net of our $600 million pension contribution. Turning to CapEx; fourth quarter capital expenditures were $459 million with the full year totaling $1.4 billion. Also in the fourth quarter we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders via dividends and gross share repurchases. For the full year 2017 we returned $4.9 billion to shareholders including cash dividends of $2.8 billion and gross share repurchases of $2.1 billion. Looking ahead to 2018 we remain encouraged by the numerous opportunities to invest in the business to improve both, growth and productivity while continuing to return significant cash to our shareholders. Thus in light of these opportunities coupled with tax reform we are increasing the top end of our 2018 CapEx expectation $100 million to a range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. In addition, we now expect gross share repurchases in the range of $2 billion to $5 billion versus $2 billion to $4 billion previously. Let's now review our business group performance starting with industrial on Slide 10. The industrial business group posted organic growth of 3.9% in Q4 and 4.9% for the year. Our heartland businesses within industrial had a good finish to the year with abrasives up high single digits. Industrial adhesives and tapes and automotive aftermarket both grew mid-single digits in the quarter. Our automotive OEM business was up 5% continuing its consistent track record of outpacing growth in global car and light truck builds. Finally, the separation and purification business grew low single digits while advanced materials declined year-on-year against last year's strong comp. On a geographic basis industrials organic growth was led by a high single digit increase in Asia-Pacific followed by mid-single digit growth in both, EMEA and Latin America/Canada. Industrial delivered fourth quarter operating income of $527 million with an operating margin of 19.4%. Underlying margins were up 50 basis points year-over-year adjusting for incremental strategic investments and a Q4 2016 gain on divestiture. Please turn to Slide 11; fourth quarter Safety & Graphic sales grew 10.7% organically with double digit increases across both, developed and developing markets. Our personal safety business posted double digit organic growth in Q4 with broad-based growth across all geographies. The roofing granules business had a strong finish to the year as a result of the rebuilding efforts following last fall's hurricanes. Transportation Safety was up mid-single digits with particular strength in reflective sheeting for roadway infrastructure. This business continues to transform its portfolio to focus on the connected roadways of the future. Geographically, Safety & Graphics grew organically across all areas led by an 18% increase in Asia-Pacific, 12% increase in EMEA and a 9% increase in the U.S. Operating income was $406 million and underlying operating margins were up 370 basis points year-on-year adjusting for the Scott Safety acquisition, divestiture impacts and incremental strategic investments. Please turn to Slide 12; healthcare increased 3.1% organically in the fourth quarter. For the full year healthcare grew nearly 4% with second half organic growth of 5%. In Q4 our medical consumables business which includes advanced wound management and infection prevention solutions posted mid-single digit organic growth. Oral care delivered 3% organic growth in the quarter as we continue to post strong international growth, particularly in developing markets. Fourth quarter organic growth was led by high single digit increases in both Food Safety and Health Information Systems which posted its strongest growth quarter of the year. On a geographic basis healthcare grew across all geographies with continued strength in developing markets which were up 15% in the quarter. Healthcare's fourth quarter operating income was $464 million and operating margins were 31.5%. Next let's cover Electronics & Energy on Slide 13. Electronics & Energy organic sales growth was 11% for the fourth quarter and the full year. The electronic side of the business grew 14% organically as our team continued to increase penetration on many OEM platforms globally including semiconductor manufacturing, electronic assembly, displays, data centers and automotive electrification. Our energy related businesses were up 4% organically with electrical markets up high single digits, partially offset by a decline in telecom. We continue to actively manage our Electronics & Energy portfolio in the quarter with the announced divestiture of the communications markets business. On a geographic basis organic growth was led by a 15% increase in Asia-Pacific although U.S. was up high single digits and EMEA up mid-single digits. Fourth quarter operating income for Electronics & Energy was $334 million with operating margin of 25.2%. Underlying margins were up 80 basis points year-on-year adjusting for incremental strategic investments and the gain on sale of non-core intellectual property in Q4 2016. Please turn to Slide 14; consumer continued to deliver improved organic growth in the fourth quarter, up 5.4%, its strongest quarterly organic growth since Q4 2014. Consumer posted organic growth across all businesses and geographic areas in the fourth quarter. Our home improvement business grew double digits organically continuing its track record of strong performance throughout 2017. This business continues to win in the marketplace with leading brands such as Command, ScotchBlue, Infiltrate [ph]. We also saw good growth in consumer healthcare with notable strength in our next care branded bandages. Looking at consumer geographically growth was led by high single digit increases in both, EMEA and Asia-Pacific although U.S. and Latin America/Canada increased mid-single digits. Finally, operating income increased 18% to $269 million with an operating margin of 22.9%. That wraps up our review of fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 15 and I'll hand it back over to Inge. Inge?\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Nick. The fourth quarter was a strong ending to an equally strong year. In 2017 we executed a 3M playbook and deliver on each of our four long-term financial metrics which we laid out at our Investor Day in March 2016. We posted earnings of $9.17 per share, a 12% increase year-on-year. Organic growth was a robust 5% with positive growth across all business groups and geographic areas. We posted free cash flow conversion of 100% along with a return on invested capital of 21%, and for the fourth consecutive year we expanded margins companywide coming in at 25% in 2017. Beyond these financial results we continued to make good progress on our three key levers which are significant value creators. The first lever is portfolio management. In October we finalized the acquisition of Scott Safety as we continue to build strings-on-strings in our personal safety portfolio. At the same time we divested four businesses that no longer align with our strategic objectives. Portfolio management is strengthening our competitiveness and making us even more relevant to our customers and the marketplace. I will move onto investing and innovation which is the second lever. 3M's primary growth metric is organic local currency sales growth as we invent unique solutions that advance, enhance and improve outcomes for our customers. That is why research and development is the heartbeat of 3M; and in 2017 we invested $1.9 billion in R&D or 6% of sales. And as you can see in our results, these investments are paying off in terms of organic growth and also our premium margins and return on invested capital. Business transformation is the third lever which starts and ends with our customers. The rollout of ERP system in West Europe is nearly complete and we have started initial deployments in the United States. I'm pleased with how our teams around the world are executing business transformation which is already benefiting our customers and 3M. In summary, 2017 was a strong year for our enterprise and we are positioned to build on our momentum and deliver another successful performance in 2018. Please turn to Slide 16; here you see our updated planning estimates for 2018. We now anticipate earnings of $10.20 to $10.70 per share, up from the previous range of $9.60 to $10. Our tax rate is expected to be 20% to 22% versus the prior range of 26% to 27%. The remainder of our guidance is unchanged. Organic growth is expected in the range of 3% to 5% and we continue to anticipate strong performance in terms of both return on invested capital and free cash flow conversion. Please turn to Slide 17; for more than a century the strings of 3M business model has enabled us to invest in the business while also returning cash to our shareholders; this has included a strong steady and rising dividend which is a hallmark of our enterprise. Over the last five years we have doubled 3M's special dividend and today we are announcing a 16% increase in our first quarter dividend for 2018 to $1.36 per share. This marks 60 consecutive years of dividend increases and reflects confidence in our ability to continue generating premium returns in 2018 and beyond. With that I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie: My first question is on Electronics & Energy; clearly you guys are exiting especially in the electronics segment, exiting the year very strongly yet a couple of companies in the supply chain reported yesterday very good results, yet the organic growth profile is still expected at 1% to 4% for 2018. Is that just conservatism or are there other puts and takes that we need to be aware of for this year?\nInge Thulin: First of all, we are very pleased with the momentum we see in that business and you see those multiple things that is moving us forward and it's all coming back to the way we have repositioned the portfolio in the past. We are coming off stronger in the end of the year than we went into the year for 2017. As Nick said in his remarks, we continue to be expecting on multiple platforms and that should of course reflect more growth as we go. It's too early for us however as we asked into the third week of January to exchange the guidance that we have for the total enterprise and all that business. But I would say that the momentum is there and we see this as a very positive business for us as we move ahead but it's too early for me and for us to change the guidance but I wouldn't be overly concerned at all about that business.\nJoe Ritchie: Maybe shifting gears a little bit; Nick, just focused on capital allocation for a second saw that growth repurchase number went up, it seems like you've got a little bit around $4 billion or so on your balance sheet. Do -- should we be thinking about the pace of capital deployment being a little bit faster now that you have access to your international cash as well?\nNicholas Gangestad: The big longer term picture of our capital allocation plan that's not really changing, the way we're investing first in the business, supplementing that with acquisitions that we think makes sense and fit well with our business and then also returning cash to shareholders, that whole capital allocation strategy is unchanged, tax reform and the ability to access international cash a little easier does give us added flexibility. And in the short-term you're seeing a few things change, slightly raising the high-end of our CapEx range, also on our share buybacks and our 16% dividend increase. Those are the things in the short-term they are immediately changing, I will also point out that late in the year we did add an extra $600 million to our U.S. pension immediately following the U.S. signing of this into law. So in the short-term those are the things we're doing but the long-term, our overall strategy isn't changing.\nJoe Ritchie: And if you don't mind me just sneaking in one more; I just wanted to ask you about FX, I saw that you guys didn't change your guidance for FX but the dollar has weekend since you originally gave guidance. So two part question; shouldn't you have a better benefit from FX or is your hedging policy not going to allow you to have an increased benefit? And then secondly, typically you're able to pass-through greater price when the dollar weakens and so if you can comment on that that would be helpful.\nNicholas Gangestad: To the first point even as recent as last week when we look at our exchange rates and the impact on our earnings, $0.10 that we guided in December that's a very good estimate for the total year. If that changes we'll start to modify that but I think that's still a very solid number to go with. To the second part of your question, I think you may have it reversed when the dollar strengthens against developing markets in developing market economies that's where we see some upward price actions that we take; it's usually not in the reverse.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Inge, can you talk about the 11% growth that you saw in Safety & Graphics in Q4? We obviously remember you saying that Safety & Graphics is the next potential big breakout candidate; do you think that the big difference now in Safety & Graphics is commodity based growth within personal safety and really starting to come back and this uplift actually looks sustainable in '18 given the higher commodity prices and maybe it's all the work you've done in portfolio management but how does that make the 4% to 6% organic growth guidance for '18 look? Could it actually end up being conservative?\nInge Thulin: Well, first of all your memory is good. I said that that is our next breakout business and it is the breakout business as we speak, right. And if you think about the portfolio there, we also in that business as we did in EEBG took some very heavy lifting relative to the portfolio, it took us more than three years, one was four years to complete, right; so you think about that portfolio how we have let some businesses get new onus where we didn't see that we could accelerate and develop those businesses to a level that we in 3M expect us to deliver, and then we build out specifically in personal safety to today be a world-class leader in the whole personal safety area. That is continuing, that's a fantastic business for us, [indiscernible] speak when you look upon the portfolio, that is -- in some cases regulated businesses and in some cases is more consumables that we capitalize on. So in my view the other thing that is working as a positive for us is, we have now sought out also our portfolio in traffic safety. Traffic safety today is back to the core, is back to what we know how to do and where strings are; and as you know, we are also linking that business now together with automotive electrification where we now have automotive, we have EEBG and we have Safety & Graphics working on initiatives around that whole space. So I would say that again, it's a little bit early but the momentum is very good in that business, generally speaking, and it's not only personal safety. We saw now for the first time a shift to us in traffic safety that will actually be positive for us as we move ahead. Again, it's too early, I would like to make changes if you can or you're very confident to the growth rate for the year but as you know, I'm also a little bit conservative so I will wait with that, do we have at least one or two quarters behind us so we with confidence can give you different figure. But again, this is a fantastic business and I'm as proud of what they have done a some in EEBG in terms of really direct those businesses to much more relevant place for us where we can grow in a very profitable way?\nNicholas Gangestad: It looks like you're stationary in office business with consumer goods sit first time in several quarter and you mentioned in the presentation itself the e-commerce. Do do you think the channel environment issues that you've facing in that segment are behind you or is it that you've just getting penetration into those feel even three things in math fragmenting out behind you or is it that you're just getting better penetration into the van market three commissariat off the channel inventory issues. I think is both, you know we have talked about that business for some quarter in terms of the inventory position for them right and we have -- I think in every quarter have had better sales out than sales in right; so they have adjusted their position in that space. So I think it's both, you coming to a point where your comparison is easier but also inventory levels is on a better level. So we don't see at this point in time an issue with inventories in that space for the consumer business. So this is in fact the third consecutive quarter that our consumer business group is growing, this time by 5% and in fact also to a price which is very good. On a companywide as you touch on online sales, for us in the quarter our online sales as an enterprise was up 21% and for the year was 13%; so it's moving in the right direction for the consumer business so we're very pleased with that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: The sky assets you bought, it's an interesting business; if there is one reason another title is never really able to grow it -- I think it was kind of 1% grow forever. What can you guys do differently with this thing? Is it more function of -- taking the brand more globally? Is there other things that you can do to get it upto really a 3M average growth type business?\nInge Thulin: I think first of all for us that brings synergy, it brings scale and efficiency into the SCBA priority categories, right. So I think from that perspective we can add it in and become much more relevant to the customers on the market. And so the presence in gas detection is becoming much much more relevant for us and it enhanced our ability to deliver on customer solutions; so if you think about that whole personnel safety space if you like, we have now build that out from initially started to be world leader in respiratory products and then we purchased some years back, maybe 5 to 8 years back we purchased cornels [ph] welding business and then here in the later years we purchased capital safety which is full protection and now Scott Safety that is building us out in that whole space. So by definition we will be able to drive the synergy in scale in that business and be more relevant to big customers around the world, right. They are looking for as few supplier as possible but this is a regulated business, they also would like to work with companies that have a high reputation around quality and safety and that's what we stand for. So there is a lot of leverage there for us and that business is doing very well for us. We met the expectation in the quarter, the team is very energized, both our core team and the Scott Safety group that came into us. And you'll be able to now to manufacture and innovate safe products based on our technology. So we can add more on the technology side and I think we will be very effective into commercialization part of that business.\nScott Davis: Obviously, it's a great brand and anything called Scott has to be pretty good. Getting exciting I asked you a question that's kind of a little bit off the path here and I haven't asked this to any companies yet; I mean this Tax Act thing is really interesting and I haven't heard anybody comment whether this is something that can help you cut your tax -- your corporate G&A tax cost and supply chain. And what I mean by that is, I know that some companies didn't necessarily have the most optimized supply chain set up but inter-company, things moving around essentially just to avoid taxes -- I'm not accusing you guys of avoiding taxes, just saying there is some structures that were created maybe that weren't efficient overtime. Is there anything there and as far as actual costs that come down from this Tax Act is it just the fact you're just paying lower taxes or is this real -- is there something else there too?\nNicholas Gangestad: Scott, there is a couple of things I'll go into on this. One is, we've been on a journey for several years to be really optimizing our supply chain and how to operate that as efficiently and effectively as possible and part of that has been our centers of expertise that we've set up in different parts of the world to drive operationally efficiency; that also has some tax benefits to us and the strategies that we've put in place to optimize our supply chain that were relevant before, continue to be relevant for us and driving benefits for us going forward, in fact we're going to continue that type of effort and expand that. Underlying of the impact of the tax reform; there are different pieces of that, some impacting different companies differently, obviously just lowering the tax rate to -- in the U.S. to 21% is a benefit to a company like 3M. But in addition, the U.S. Tax Code, the new U.S. tax law does give some favorable handling to companies that are net exporters out of the U.S. and part of the benefit that you're seeing 3M as we guide 20% to 22% is that we're a net exporter of approximately $3.5 billion out of the U.S. of what we manufacture, that's also part of that benefit that you're seeing for our company.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Inch: Nick, why did U.S. pricing -- I apologize if you said this before; it looks like it got worst sequentially but you had very easy comparisons from last year. I'm surprised the U.S. went from minus 2 to minus 7 but your price in the U.S. goes from minus 2 to minus 3; what -- 0.3 obviously; what's going on?\nNicholas Gangestad: John, throughout all of 2017 -- I'll frame it just a little bit longer where -- if I go back to '15 and '16, less growth in the U.S., part of our focus in 2017 is ensuring that our U.S. operations are growing and productive and that's what we've seen so for instance in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter growing 3% organically. Now throughout the four quarters of 2017 in our U.S. we've been hovering around 20 or 30 basis points of price decline, the single biggest thing driving that John has not changed throughout the entire year and that's that as we now be -- now moving to growth in the U.S. we do have rebate incentive plans with our most loyal customers and our best performing customers that's been part of our business model and part of that model is, they get some price break via rebates and that's by far the single biggest thing impacting price that we're posting in the U.S. in 2017; really unchanged from the other three quarters of 2017.\nJohn Inch: [Indiscernible] is not showing up within your segments because U.S. industrial core growth was up only 1% this quarter and it was up 5% last quarter but -- so I'm assuming that's not an industrially weighted rebate program, is that kind of on the consumer side, is that why consumer did a little better or\u2026\nNicholas Gangestad: John, there are some aspects of that in all of our businesses but the U.S. and Safety & Graphics I would say are more heavily weighted to having those types of pricing plans.\nJohn Inch: So was there something about U.S. industrial as to why it seemed like its core growth slowed considering we're sort of living in what appears to be an accelerating industrial economy, certainly in the fourth quarter. Was there timing issues or mix issues or what was going on there?\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes, if you're looking at our growth in the U.S. in industrial, the one big thing I'll point out is fourth quarter of last year of 2016; we had approximately a $40 million defense contract that we won and sold that -- that quarter -- that is -- that's the single biggest thing, if we pulled that out we have had very nice accelerating growth in our industrial business.\nJohn Inch: Kind of at what level though? So if you were to apples-to-apples, that defense business where is the U.S.? I'm just trying to get a sense of how your U.S. business is cadencing; is that kind of a low single digit, mid-single digit, what's the trend?\nNicholas Gangestad: Pulling that out we would have been in the mid-single digit range, John.\nJohn Inch: Okay, so that makes sense. And then, just -- back to the pricing lastly; it's sort of obvious that there is inflation in the economy, I mean how far the inflation -- I mean U.S. economy, how far it carries is another matter but maybe Inge, what are your thoughts or neck it toward being able to recapture your own input cost pressures whether they'd be healthcare, rising wage pressures, other sort of things and being able to kind of pass that through and you sort of juxtapose that against what you've just described as a price down program to try and stimulate some U.S. volumes. So I guess this is rising in U.S. inflation and possibly a bit of a headwind incrementally for margins or how can you manage it?\nNicholas Gangestad: John, over a period of time we've been able to get 30 to 50 basis points of price growth. Now in 2017 we were approximately flat on price growth, we're highly confident in 2018 that we'll be back into the range of 30 to 50 basis points of price growth over \u2013 throughout 2018.\nInge Thulin: John, let me also correct you on one thing. You say the price down [ph] initiative is not the price down initiative; it is what Nick said you know, what is happening -- there is an increase in the incentive program rebates to the loyal customers and channel partners, that's what it is. So it doesn't start with a price down initiative and I'd like to correct you on that, it's not the price down; so what you see on that line with Nick clearly said to you and to us is to say it's about the incentive programs and we have set up now for two quarters in a row.\nJohn Inch: Yes, I'm sorry; the volume rebates, the more you buy\u2026\nNicholas Gangestad: I thought you said price down and that's not correct.\nJohn Inch: No, I think I misspoke. I do know what you mean and taking into -- I'm didn't mean to provide a cutting price, you're giving incentives for people to buy more.\nNicholas Gangestad: Exactly.\nJohn Inch: So my last question that is the 30 to 50 given the pressures in the economy is that going to be enough Nick? Like, I don't have visibility into how much the emerging inflation in The United States is actually going to potentially pressure your operations; I mean historically you've got very strong margins so I don't expect substantial margin pressure, I just want to think -- understand how you're thinking about managing this.\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes, in terms of how we're thinking about and managing 30 to 50 I feel highly confident on. Directionally, I feel there is more upside on that than downside, partially for what -- exactly what you're talking about John that inflationary environment and increasing raw material prices; if there is a bias towards that it's towards the high-end or above and not to the low end or below.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Couple of questions on the slide deck Page 8 on GAAP adjustments; and for Nick just starting on the tax rate, the benefit this quarter you called out supply chains but it lacks excellence and geographic profit mix. At $0.13 that's not related to tax reform, is that correct? And is this more -- is this a sustainable benefit or how would you characterize it?\nNicholas Gangestad: Deane, you are first of all correct, that has nothing to do with tax reform that we've isolated separately. And the three things I talked about, let me give you a little more depth of that -- of what's driving that. Year-on-year we are seen, our centers of expertise and their efficiency and the profitability in those grow and that's certainly a part of our strategy and sustainable that we expect and also captured in our 20% to 22% guidance for 2018. The geographic profit mix which is the smallest of the three is where do we actually earn that profit, how much is being earned in our highest tax jurisdictions versus the lowest and that will vary from year to year. And then the last is stock-based compensation, and we get a tax benefit as we have more of our employees exercising stock options; that one will be the most variable and as our stock price has gone up and we have employees exercising stock options we're getting a larger benefit from that than we've had a year ago.\nDeane Dray: And then just as a follow-up; we're going through the segment color, auto came up a couple of different times, once in the electronic side on auto electrification and then it's always been in industrial. I'm just -- would like to hear from Inge on how you coordinate when a business or an end market crosses segments, the go-to-market strategy and -- are there additional kind of coordination efforts that need to make sure it goes smoothly?\nInge Thulin: Yes, there is. So first of all, we have appointed a Vice President to lead a portion inside of automotive that we call automotive electrification, and it's he that is coordinating the activities going on in the company relative to the face into the automotive business. We also monitor and manage the result out of that enterprise, so we look upon what we have called -- still call automotive business, OEM business and then we have a line out that we call automotive electrification underperformance of that; and we see that we are improving our performance in automotive electrification. So that piece of the business we had 15% growth in Q4 and in total of automotive we have done very, very well as well. So that piece is growing overtime and as we have said earlier, that's a $6 billion addressable market opportunity growing maybe 6% to 8%; and so that's big opportunity for us when we add those two together. But it's working very well for us and -- then I said earlier; I think in addition for us from a competitive perspective is that we are both very engaged with the automotive OEM customer but also with the highway transportation authorities across the world in order to build out something that I think can be remarkable as you look down the road so to speak relative to that opportunity for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin: I just wanted to clarify on John's question regarding rebates in North America. Am I correct in thinking that you sort of have a growth rate in view and then you said rebates relative to this growth rate; so if people exceed them they get better rebates. So if you set the growth rate higher next year, rebates would kick in at a higher growth rate; is that a fair way of looking at it?\nNicholas Gangestad: Andrew, I'd say that's a very fair way of looking at it. We started with a growth expectation and 2017 is a year where many of our customers exceeded that growth expectation, getting higher rebates; that becomes part of the base as we reset those targets for the coming year. And in comparison in '15 and '16, we had below average rebate payments; so we're seeing it from '16 to '17 swing from below to above in '17. I think '18 will be more of a normalized year.\nAndrew Obin: And just to go back on automotive electrification; I think Inge was quoted in The Wall Street Journal before the New Year sort of saying that you guys could have billions of opportunity from EV and I just can't resist but I ask -- but to ask at the Analyst Day, I think you sort of thought it was a great opportunity; Inge was quoted saying it was billions. If you could just sort of talk a little bit about sort of underlying assumptions about what the market looks like by the time you have those billions from EV and its billions -- $2 billion, $10 billion, anything will be appreciated. Thank you.\nInge Thulin: Well, as I said addressable market is $6 billion. And if you think about the whole area for us where we can make a difference in that whole industry and then put on the electrification to the cause, so we have some of management, we have light weightening, we have sensors were displaced, we have [indiscernible] and vertical signings and payment markings; so that's -- think about that in the whole area. If you look upon automotive electrification at this point in time, for us that's around $200,000 million in size and growing very fast. So the first billion should be in reach rather sooner than later but we'll take a couple of years. But for me and the team here, this is a unique opportunity for 3M to capitalize on our technologies and the connection we have in the industry because the industry here if you think about it, if you think very narrow then you think automotive and automotive electrification, this is bigger than that; this coming into the whole highway transportation area and I thought it's relative to regulations around it and we had been in Traffic Safety for over 80 years, we have the connection, we work with them daily; so when you put this all together we would be in a very, very good position to move forward. So you know, we're very, very encouraged to what we see and the momentum and already early spec ins on the automotive -- on platforms that will not come immediately but is coming maybe 18 to 24 months out as those platforms go into production.\nAndrew Obin: And when you say $6 billion of market opportunity, should we expect 3M to capture a 3M like market share within that market?\nInge Thulin: Why not? We don't commit in order to go in and do something less than that. So that is what you should expect and that's what we expect here, we expect that from ourselves, right; so that's -- when we commit to do it we will do it the right way and we will be focused on it. So we will take market share as we move ahead and I believe when we look upon these three to five years from now, I think we will -- maybe done it right, we will all say that was a masterstroke.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Tusa: Just on kind of next year, now that you have a betted [ph] more of a turn of the car drove to December -- how do you see kind of seasonality playing out; anything in the comparisons here in electronics or anything else that we should expect when thinking about quarterly growth progression as it move through the year or is it pretty steady all around the three to five?\nNicholas Gangestad: Steve, our view is it's a pretty steady throughout the year, we're not seen any big outliers one direction or the other, it's as pretty as close to down the middle of the road as we could be.\nStephen Tusa: Okay. And then this -- the CapEx; is that a minor step-up, is that sustainable longer term or is that just hey we're going to invest a little bit here with the new tax regime and it will begin to migrate back down over the long-term?\nNicholas Gangestad: Our longer term guidance Steve of 4.5% to 5% I still see that as the right long-term view but in light of what we see in the economy; in light of tax reform, in light of investment opportunities around disruptive technologies that can help us -- make us more efficient, all that in combination is causing us to up our planned spend slightly this year but 4.5% to 5% is still the right range in the longer term.\nStephen Tusa: And then one more; just when you look at the earnings bridge that you guys gave in December, any tweak to that? I guess strategic investments this year came in a little bit lower but there were some other moving parts like the legal settlement etcetera; so any anything in that bridge that moves around that you wanted to highlight, the earnings bridge?\nNicholas Gangestad: No, it is January; so other than the update in tax we're not changing anything. As things start to play out after a quarter or two, there might be some tweaks like we're clearly watching FX and what that's doing; raw materials that continues to be a moving target for us. And then share repurchase is another one that I say we continue to watch of what it's impact going to be on EPS.\nStephen Tusa: The gain in the safety business; did that run just to profit not the revenue, correct? Just to be clear.\nNicholas Gangestad: Correct, that was all through operating income, no revenue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Winoker: Now that we're seeing Scott Safety be integrated capital; the last big one, before that I guess it was Polly [ph], so something like $5.5 billion been on the transactions and your result so far even if there was criticism about initial price paid on the street resulting to be pretty impressive as far as growth etcetera and I assume you're heading towards your return on capital targets. Are you thinking again in terms of the profile for 3M, the ability to kind of find and digest M&A becoming an even more accelerated part of the growth story at a nearer term or is it still just steady as she goes?\nInge Thulin: Well, as you know primary objective and strategy is organic local currency growth, right, and that's also why we invest in research and development with around 6%, right; last year that's like $1.9 billion, and that is the heartbeat of 3M, that is what is providing us with premium solutions for customers and premium returns for shareholders; I think that's an important element. Now we have shift activities in the portfolio in order to build out relevance with our customers and markets, and we will continue to do that in order to compliment as we move ahead in areas that we are interested to do and our pipeline is good, we have many alternatives to look upon and I think as we go you will see probably the same steady path as we had in the past. So I don't think that has changed on that as we move ahead; as long as we get the growth on the investment we do in research and development and we do as we speak and we have also as you see stepped up to growth where we had complemented with good solid acquisitions that we've integrated to the company and I don't know if you recognize that but we have also worked with -- we buy world-class asset, we don't buy something that we need to fix and try to move in; and the reason for that is there should be good processes in place from the company we buy, there should be world-class management that can come into 3M and with this -- the four fundamental strings we have we can create value as fast as possible for our shareholders.\nSteven Winoker: Nick, maybe you could put a fire point on the commodity side; I mean I know when a lot of the factories on that -- heist [ph] is another -- you guys appear certainly more vertically integrated than a lot of other multi-industrial model for a lot of reason but maybe just refresh us in terms of what the commodity exposure is these days and how you're thinking about just that side of the framework?\nNicholas Gangestad: Steven, in total we've spend between $7.5 billion and $8 billion a year on raw materials, commodities and some purchase finished goods to go into our cost of goods sold; it's approaching half of our total cost of goods sold. And it is spread out over a lot of different commodity basis but to put a bit of a finer point and this may or may not be what you're asking; we are seeing underlying commodity prices that were paying, we're seeing them go up and yet we are still reporting all in that we're getting some of the benefit. So in the fourth quarter it's a bit of a transition quarter for us that we are seeing slightly higher market prices we're paying for our commodities which currently are being more than offset by our own sourcing initiatives to bring down the cost of the materials and that can be revamping our products to use a lower raw material, can be changing the source of supply, can be some negotiations that we go through; that's still resulting in a net benefit for us year-on-year but the underlying commodity prices we are now seeing a year-on-year increase in those prices.\nSteven Winoker: And can you size that all that the increase itself?\nNicholas Gangestad: 1% or slightly less than 1%; it's still a pretty muted number for us.\nSteven Winoker: And if you were advising investors to look at a few specific commodities for that 1% which one should we look at?\nNicholas Gangestad: There is about one-eighth of our entire commodity base that is petroleum based and when we first set our guidance we had an expectation of oil prices in the $50 to $60 a barrel, that's gone up; so there is some sensitivity there for oil derivative products that go into some of our tapes and adhesives and films.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line to Rob McCarthy of Stifel, Nicholas & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert McCarthy: On Steve's question about commodities, in particular oil; I mean in the past you have given a little bit more granular sensitivity, particularly in the retrenchment that occurred in 2014 through mid-2016 timeframe. Could you just kind of level set expectations on the upside with respect to that given the fact that oil started to move up pretty materially here and we could see even a potential oil shock if there is a geopolitical hiccup of some sort. And then, just -- if you could talk about maybe the embedded energy exposure of the portfolio overall because we probably learned a lot from the downturn about businesses that were tied into energy and affected the interim [ph] organic growth and how do you think about that sensitivity if we start to move our way up with the whole petrochem complex?\nNicholas Gangestad: Rob I think there's a couple different dimensions; I'll talk to the raw material side and then I'll talk to the market dimension side. What I've said in the past is a $10 move in oil manifest for us in about a $0.02 to $0.03 annual raw material headwind for us or $0.02 to $0.03 whatever direction oil is moving, it's going up, it's a $0.02 to $0.03 headwind for us and that comes from things like -- some of the resins we buy that have a crude oil derivative that goes into that. So that's on the commodity side but I think you also might be talking about the market itself; so when we saw oil prices drop late '14 into '15 our overall market exposure, we still see about 3% of our total revenue that's tied to the oil and gas industry. So if there is -- as we've seen that stabilize that's been a help to us and if there is an uptick that's certainly a positive for us on the revenue perspective.\nRobert McCarthy: In the context of these continued progress on these European investments could you just kind of level set what your expectations for asking to be a longer term for SKU rationalization of the company? And what that could mean from benefits not only to operating margin through simplification and then working capital benefits, just risk -- you're carrying probably less inventory and less complex inventory; could you just talk about that?\nNicholas Gangestad: What we've laid out is that by 2020 we expect $500 million and $700 million of operating income benefit through what we're doing through our business transformation, as well as $0.5 billion of working capital coming out of our supply chain as a result of that; that remains unchanged. And in December I think if you were listening to what we are saying, we also are starting to see benefits beyond that that it's not a just a plateau of that and it's a steady state, we see that continuing to grow. Now topics like SKU rationalization, that is one component; we don't have it carved out of this is exactly what SKU rationalization is of that total piece but what we do see is looking at our portfolio, the SKUs we have which ones make sense which ones don't, that is part of what we're doing as we transform our business and our business processes. So it's a component, what I can't tell you is how much of a component that is of that total $500 million to $700 million that we're projecting.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff [ph] of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Nick, I've seen a few multinationals unable to bring down tax rate as much maybe all of us would have thought on some of the simple spreadsheet map, obviously that's about the case here for you. Some company is mentioning this so-called guilty tax as minimum tax issue, does that not apply to you? Does the export situation negate that? Can you give us -- if it's possible to give us a nutshell answer to that.\nNicholas Gangestad: The acronym guilty and the acronym beat those components that I know are negatively impacting some other companies are having a negligible or non-existent impact on 3M.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then I was also just wondering back to the discussion around equity compensation on tax rate; any change on how we should think about the flipside of that equation, in other words the differences between gross repo and net repo as you deal with the dilution on the shareholder -- I'm sorry, on the employee side?\nNicholas Gangestad: In the past we've said that we need about $1 billion of share growth -- share repurchase just to offset that dilution; that's come down slightly, I believe it's right now around $800 million. That's not changing materially and we're thinking the $700 million to $800 million is a more longer term steady state of what we need just to offset dilution.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then just finally, I heard what was said on the bridge; one that just jumps up for me a little bit though is pension. If I think about all those 2018 bridge items with the contribution here and I think a decent bump on the long. Is that dime [ph] a pension headwind fully baked in the cake or is that possibly moving around a little bit?\nNicholas Gangestad: That is the final number, so as the pension contribution helped it the lowering of interest rates and therefore our discount rates in the last few weeks of December more or less offset that; so it's call those a push and where I still write at the dime that we said.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: How should we think about incremental margins over the year that is -- should wage and input cost pressure increase in the second half?\nNicholas Gangestad: In the second half of 2018?\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes.\nNicholas Gangestad: No. As far as wages what we're expecting for wage costs increases in 2018; it remains very similar to what we've seen in the last couple of years, really no change on our ability to generate incremental leverage. So we are not seeing a shift up or down in the pace of wage increases that we've seen historically.\nUnidentified Analyst: And the second question; how long can you sustain the current pace of growth in Asia before you need to accelerate investment in new capacity?\nNicholas Gangestad: So we have been consistently investing in our capacity in Asia, working to increase our regional self-sufficiency of more and more that we are selling in the Asia Pacific is being manufactured in Asia Pacific. Right now we still have capacity and we will continue to sustain it, I don't see it a dramatic change in direction of the amount of CapEx going in, it's been at about the right pace and we think it's a pretty sustainable pace we're at; so I don't see a big direction change on that.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for some closing comments.\nInge Thulin: Thank you. To wrap up, the fourth quarter capped a strong year for us here at 3M; and I would like to take this opportunity to thank our 3M team for their contributions to a successful 2017 and for moving us closer to our vision of advancing every company, enhancing every home and improving every life.

Welcome to the 3M Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, October 24, 2017. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland - 3M Co.: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2017 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President, and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Before we begin let me remind you of the dates for our future investor events. Please turn to slide 2. First, starting with earnings, our Q4 earnings conference call will be held on January 25. And second, our 2018 outlook meeting will take place in New York City on December 12 from 8 a.m. to noon. Invitations for this event will be sent this afternoon, so please RSVP as soon as possible. We hope to see you there. Please take a moment to read our forward-looking statement on slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to slide 4. And I'll hand the call off to Inge.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Coming off a strong first half, our team delivered an even more robust performance in the third quarter. Organic growth accelerated to 7% with positive growth across all business groups and all geographic areas. We posted record sales and record earnings and did so while continuing to invest for the future. Let me take you through the highlights. Total sales were $8.2 billion, an all-time high for our enterprise. As I mentioned, we delivered strong broad-based organic growth of 7% led by Electronics & Energy at 13%. Health Care grew 7% organically, followed by 6% growth for both Industrial and Safety & Graphics. Our Consumer business posted organic growth of 2%, its second consecutive quarter of positive growth. It was also good to see broad-based growth across all geographic areas. This was true in both developed and developing markets, where our long-standing presence, market position, and depth of capabilities enable us to win. Growth in developed market was 4% with 14% growth in developing markets. With respect to EPS, we increased earnings more than 8% to $2.33 per share, which is a Q3 record. Company-wide we expanded margins to 25% with all business groups above 22%. Turning to free cash flow, we posted a good conversion rate of 100%. We continue to invest and grow the business while also returning significant cash to our shareholders. And in the quarter we returned $1.1 billion through dividends and share repurchases. Please turn to slide 5. Beyond financial results, we are continuing to build an enterprise that is positioned for success both today and into the future. This includes executing our three key levers, which are significant value creators. The first is portfolio management. And earlier this month we finalized our acquisition of Scott Safety. This will complement organic growth and further enhance our position in the fast-growing global personal safety market. At the same time, we completed the sales of the electronic monitoring business, which no longer aligned with our strategic objectives. Portfolio management, a process we have intensified over the last several years, is strengthening our competitiveness and making us more relevant to our customers and the marketplace. Investing in innovation is the second lever. Research and development is the heartbeat of 3M. It's how we deliver premium value to our customers and premium returns to our shareholders. This is why we continue to invest 6% of sales into research and development, which total $463 million in the quarter. The third lever is business transformation, which starts and ends with our customers. The deployment of our ERP system remains on track with West Europe nearly complete. We have also started initial deployments in the United States, which you will hear more about at our outlook meeting on December 12. That concludes my remarks. And I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Thanks, Inge, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 6 with a recap of our third quarter sales performance. We posted strong organic growth in the quarter of 6.6%, as we continue to outgrow the markets we serve. Selling prices improved sequentially versus second quarter and were flat year on year. Excluding Electronics, price was up 20 basis points, which marks our strongest quarterly pricing performance this year. The divestiture of nonstrategic businesses over the last 12 months reduced sales in the quarter by 120 basis points. Conversely, foreign currency translation increased sales by 60 basis points. All-in, third quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 6% versus last year. In the U.S., organic growth was 3.6%, led by a high single digit increase in Health Care and a mid-single-digit increase in Industrial. Our Safety & Graphics and Consumer businesses also delivered positive growth in the quarter. Asia-Pacific led the company with organic growth of 13% in Q3. All business groups within Asia-Pacific continued to post strong growth in the quarter, including double digit increases in our Electronics & Energy business and in our Safety & Graphics business. Organic growth was 23% in China/Hong Kong and 5% in Japan. Excluding Electronics, China/Hong Kong grew in the mid-teens and Japan was up 3%. Moving to EMEA, organic growth was 4% in Q3 with West Europe up 3%. Both the Safety & Graphics and Industrial businesses led the growth in EMEA. Finally, Q3 organic growth in Latin America/Canada was 5%. All businesses posted positive growth with Health Care leading the way, up high single digits. At a country level, Canada delivered strong organic growth of 14%. Mexico was up 5%, while Brazil was flat. We continue to generate broad-based growth across the globe, giving us confidence in raising our full year expectations, which Inge will discuss later. Please turn to slide 7 for the third quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide, third quarter sales were $8.2 billion with net income of $1.4 billion, up 7.5%. On a GAAP basis, third quarter operating margins were 25%, which includes a 60 basis point impact from incremental strategic investments. Let's take a closer look at the various components of our margin performance in the third quarter. Gains from organic volume growth and productivity contributed 90 basis points to operating margins. Our continued focus on portfolio management is strengthening our enterprise in many ways, including margins, which improved by 40 basis points due to the exit of nonstrategic businesses. The combination of lower raw material costs and selling price changes added another 30 basis points. Foreign currency net of hedging impacts brought margins down 40 basis points in the quarter. And higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense decreased margins by 30 basis points. Let's now turn to slide 8 for a closer look at earnings per share. Third quarter GAAP earnings were $2.33 per share, up 8.4% year over year. This result includes a $0.06 impact from incremental strategic investments. The combination of organic growth and productivity contributed $0.23 per share to Q3 earnings. Organic growth was the predominant driver along with raw material benefits and the continued positive impact business transformation is having on our productivity efforts. Acquisitions and divestitures added a penny to earnings year over year. Foreign currency net of hedging reduced earnings by $0.03 a share. And the slightly lower tax rate was a $0.01 benefit. Finally, lower shares outstanding net of higher interest expense was a $0.02 benefit to EPS. Please turn to slide 9 for a look at cash flow. We continue to generate solid operating cash flow as a company, which allows us to consistently invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. Third quarter free cash flow was $1.4 billion with a conversion rate of 100%. For the full year, we expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 100%. Turning to CapEx, we continue to be encouraged by the numerous opportunities to invest in both growth and disruptive technologies. Third quarter capital expenditures were $325 million. And we expect these investments to be approximately $1.4 billion for the year. In addition to investing in our businesses, we returned significant cash to shareholders in Q3, including $701 million in dividends, up $31 million. We also returned $380 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases, or $1.6 billion year to date. We now expect full year repurchases to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion versus $2 billion to $3.5 billion previously. Let's now review our performance by business group. Please turn to slide 10. Industrial, our largest business group, continued its strong growth, up 6.1% organically in the third quarter. Industrial's growth was once again broad-based across all geographic areas and all businesses. Our Heartland businesses within Industrial \u2013 namely industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives, and automotive aftermarket \u2013 all delivered mid-single digit growth in the quarter. Our auto OEM business was up 6%, outpacing global car and light truck builds by approximately 400 basis points, as we continue to drive increased penetration on the automotive OEM platforms across the globe. Finally, advanced materials led the way with mid-teens growth in the quarter with strong performance across its portfolio, while also benefiting from favorable year-on-year comps. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by a high single digit increase in Asia-Pacific, while all other areas grew mid-single digits. Industrial delivered third quarter operating income of $614 million with an operating margin of 22.2%. Adjusting for incremental strategic investments, operating margins were 22.6%, a 110 basis point improvement from Q2 levels. Please turn to slide 11. Third quarter Safety & Graphics sales grew 6% organically. Growth was led by our personal safety business, which accelerated to double digit growth in the quarter. We continue to experience strong demand for our personal safety solutions and look to build on this strength with the integration of Scott Safety starting here in the fourth quarter. Our roofing granules business grew solidly, up mid-single digits on top of a tough year-on-year comp. Lastly, transportation safety posted positive organic growth in Q3, as we continue to evolve its portfolio with the sale of the electronic monitoring business earlier this month. Geographically, Safety & Graphics grew organically across all areas, led by an 11% increase in Asia-Pacific and an 8% increase in EMEA. Third quarter profits in Safety & Graphics were up 11% year on year to $410 million with operating margins of nearly 27%. Please turn to slide 12. Our Health Care business in the third quarter grew 6.9% organically. Health Care delivered broad-based growth across all businesses and geographies. Our medical consumables business, which is our largest segment within Health Care, posted high single digit growth, as worldwide demand for 3M's products and solutions remains strong. Oral care delivered 3% organic growth in the quarter, as we continued to deliver strong international growth, particularly in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and West Europe. Organic growth in Health Care was led by a double digit increase in our drug delivery business. Geographically, organic growth was led by high single digit growth in Asia-Pacific, Latin America/Canada, and the U.S. We saw notable strength in Health Care across developing markets, particularly in China/Hong Kong, which was up double digits in the quarter. Health Care's operating income was $471 million and operating margins were 31.9%. Please turn to slide 13. Electronics & Energy third quarter organic sales growth was up 13% and is up 11% year to date. We are on track to deliver 10% organic growth for the year. This business continues to benefit from our portfolio management efforts over the past few years to streamline the business, enhance customer relevance, and drive improved efficiencies. The Electronics side of the business grew 18% organically, as our team continued to increase penetration on many OEM platforms globally, including semiconductor manufacturing, electronic assembly, data centers, and automotive electrification. Our Energy related businesses were up 2% organically with electrical markets up mid-single digits, partially offset by a decline in telecom. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by a 20% increase in Asia-Pacific, while Latin America/Canada and EMEA also delivered positive growth. Third quarter operating income for Electronics & Energy was $394 million with operating margins of 27.9%. Please turn to slide 14. Third quarter sales in Consumer grew organically 1.9%, which was a continued improvement versus recent quarters. We saw positive organic growth in three of our four Consumer businesses, namely home improvement, home care, and consumer health care, while stationery and office declined. Category defining brands in Consumer continue to be a strength for 3M. We delivered strong double digit growth in both Command damage-free mounting products and ScotchBlue painters tape. Filtrete home filtration products grew mid-single digits globally. Geographically, organic growth in Consumer was led by Asia-Pacific, up high single digits, while Latin America/Canada and the U.S. also delivered positive growth. Finally, operating income was $307 million with an operating margin of 24.8%. Adjusting for strategic investments year on year, operating margins were nearly 26%. Please turn to slide 15. Before turning the call back over to Inge, I want to cover a few items that will impact the fourth quarter. First, the completed divestiture of the electronic monitoring business is expected to have a net positive impact of $0.12 to earnings in Q4. Second, the Scott Safety income, net of acquisition and integration costs, is expected to reduce earnings per share by $0.08. Third, we recently closed a debt tender offer to retire some of our higher coupon debt. This will result in a nonoperating charge estimated to be an $0.11 impact to earnings per share in the fourth quarter. Lastly, as we have discussed throughout the year, we plan to continue to take actions in Q4 to strengthen our portfolio and better optimize our footprint. We estimate that these incremental investments will negatively impact fourth quarter per share earnings by approximately $0.06 to $0.10. Please turn to slide 16. And I will now turn the call back over to Inge. Inge?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you, Nick. As I look across our enterprise, I am very pleased with our performance in the quarter and throughout the year. As a result, today we are increasing our expectation for 2017 in terms of both organic growth and earnings per share. We now anticipate organic growth of 4% to 5% versus a prior range of 3% to 5%. With respect to EPS, we expect earnings of $9 to $9.10 per share, versus a prior range of $8.80 to $9.05. This is a 10% to 12% increase year on year. And as you can see, we continue to expect strong performance in terms of both return on invested capital and free cash flow conversion. With that I thank you for your attention. And we will now take your questions.\nOperator: Please limit your participation to one question and one follow up. One moment, please, while we compile the Q&A roster. And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning, guys.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning.\nBruce Jermeland - 3M Co.: Morning.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just a question, sort of a top-down question. Top-line growth 6.6%. As you think, this economic environment, right, and as you overlay it over your longer term framework, would you describe current economic environment as average relative to your five-year framework? Above average? And from that perspective, I'm just trying to think, if 6.6% is something we can expect to achieve in this environment? Or is that a one off?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Well, first of all, good morning. I think to talk about the five-year plan is maybe difficult, and that's the frame you put it into. But I will say that it's maybe on the high end versus what we thought when we lay out the plan originally as we stand. You can also see that we have a range now that we move from. We've gone from 2% to 5%, then 3% to 5%. Now we are 4% to 5% for the year. And we have very high confidence as we move into 2018, which we will talk more about on December 12 in New York. But I will say that generally speaking, the execution of our commercialization programs are going very well for us. And it's broad-based, which is very, very good. So I think it's \u2013 I think about 4% to 5% for the remainder of this year. I would think more about on the high end of the 4% to 5%.\nAndrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Terrific. And just a follow-up question. On the Electronics growth, that has been very good. Can you just give us a little bit more color what specifically drives it? And I'm just trying to understand how much of it, sort of increased content in mobile devices, particularly on adhesives. Or your participation in the Asian semiconductor cycle, if you could separate those two sources of growth. Thank you.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yes. Well, first of all, I think always on Electronics & Energy as a business group, we have, yes, to take a step back and really understand what we have done from a portfolio perspective. And that is something that we all see as we take actions. What is not so visible if you're not right in the industry day by day is also how we have shifted and accelerated some investment to faster growing segments. So I think that's an important element for us to think about. Now on the platform for consumer electronics, we are very global. So for us, we are adding penetration on a global base in most of those devices. And it's going very fast. I will say specifically on the China OEM in terms of the pickup. And if you think about that, demand there for performance, quality, and functionality is exactly what we are all about. So that means that we are growing very fast on those platforms. So we are doing better there than we had estimated, which is a positive things. I think also in terms of growth, semiconductor, of course, we are part of that growth. And I will also say the shift in terms of us focusing more now versus three years ago on data centers, on automotive electrification, on energy grids is driving this growth. So if you think about it, just to give you facts, the base where we came from was a market that had a size of $60 billion, that had a growth of 1% to 3%. We're continuing there. But we have shifted during the last couple of years to market size that are $12 billion but have a growth rate to 10% to 15%. So I think that is the answer to what we are doing there. And I would say there the fact that the growth is coming, the margin are expanding, we are more relevant to our customer, is a big credit to that business group of what they have been doing.\nAndrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: But that would imply that Electronics growth is sustainable into 2018 as well, because these are structural drivers.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah, I think so. It is. It is. But again, when you have technology conversion, you can have ups and downs in between quarters. But if you look upon the total business, we will continue to do well.\nAndrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Good morning.\nBruce Jermeland - 3M Co.: Morning, Julian.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Hey, Julian.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Morning, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Morning. Maybe just a first question around strategic investments. I think previously you talked about that being a step-up year on year of $0.20, $0.25 in the second half. Now it's looking somewhat less than that based on your guidance. Maybe just give some background as to why that's happening. Is it just a pushout into 2018? And what kind of returns? How are returns on that investment to date coming through?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yes, Julian, thanks for that question. I would call what we're doing in the third quarter as a really good example of our business model in action, where we have good organic growth, strong margins. And at the same time we're taking actions to position 3M for future success. As you mentioned, earlier this year we announced we expected to incur between $0.60 and $0.65 of strategic investments for the full year. And we're tracking right in that range. And those strategic investments include things we talked about at the beginning of the year for core growth platforms, but also actions to be improving our footprint and addressing our portfolio. All of that part of the 4% to 5% organic growth outlook we now are seeing for this year. We are making good progress on that in 2017 to better optimize our manufacturing supply chain footprint. And I'd point you back, Julian, to what we laid out when we \u2013 in March of 2016, about a plan to be investing between $500 million and $600 million over the course of a few years to ultimately generate $125 million to $175 million in annual benefits by 2020. So for the full year 2017, that $0.60 to $0.65 range does include the charge related to the debt tender that we'll be incurring in the fourth quarter. That has been part of our thinking. And we closed that tender in October, hence that charge coming in Q4.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Understood. Thank you. And then just my second question, price and raw materials in your operating margin bridge slightly picked up, a slightly larger tailwind in Q3 than in Q2. Within that, how much was the sort of raw materials portion? And do you view your current pricing trends as sustainable from here?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Most of that 30 basis points, Julian, is coming from raw materials. The pricing, as I mentioned for the total company, flat, or if I exclude Electronics, up 20 basis points. We're seeing that core underlying price growth growing as the year goes on, excluding the Electronics. So we're seeing Q3 as a quarter where our price strengthened. But the majority of that 30 basis points is coming from raw materials. And let me just elaborate a little more on that, Julian. The core underlying market we're facing for raw materials is certainly toughening. We are not seeing the underlying market creating that 30 basis points of benefit. That 30 basis points of benefit that we see hitting our financials is the result of work and projects that we're doing to take out raw material costs and the prices we're paying. So example, raw material substitutions or product reformulations to take out those raw material costs. That's the biggest thing driving that 30 basis points you're seeing.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, guys. Good morning.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Steve.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Morning, Steve.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Really, really good quarter.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Just following up on the Electronics commentary. You guided to kind of 10% for the year. I guess that implies, just making sure I get my math right here, that implies kind of 4Q at up high singles, kind of 7% to 8%. Is that correct from an organic perspective?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yes, Steve. Your math's pretty sound there.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And I guess you talked about it as sustainable. I mean you're not saying that the double digit is sustainable obviously. I mean, semiconductor sales this year are up pretty solidly double digits. So it's not quite a surprise you guys are kind of doing well there. So when you say it's sustainable, do you mean relative to kind of an index of the devices you're on? Or within the range that you talked about? Kind of the trend line rate of that business over the last several years, it's just been more like mid-single digits? What did you kind of mean by sustainable?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: So, Steve, when we say sustainable for Electronics & Energy and the opportunities that we see there, we continue to see opportunities for penetration in consumer electronics. As Inge mentioned earlier, we continue to evolve our technologies to grow our relevance in consumer electronics. But even more importantly, we're repositioning our portfolio to be going after faster growing market opportunities in Electronics & Energy. And those are places where we're seeing the results of our actions paying off, where we're seeing growth occurring there. Places like automobile electrification. So Inge said a few minutes ago, we'll always see some ups and downs based on what's happening with underlying consumer demand for electronics. But the \u2013 what you're seeing now is our business model really working, of us going after the higher growth markets.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then one more question just on kind of the investments and margins and how that's playing through. R&D was a little bit light. And anything going on there? I guess you're just kind of repurposing investments to more kind of commercial type of things? Is that how we should think about it?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. Well, there's nothing going on. As you know, we have made a commitment to increase investment in research and development from 5.5% historically, closer to 6%. We are normally just running at 6%, so it's nothing abnormal going on there. But it's not the move to commercialization from those activities. We are very committed to research and development. And for us, science, technology, and sustainability is key driver for us as we move forward and as have been in the past. So there is no shift from R&D to commercialization. Commercialization, that's where we invested those additional $104 million for the year, when we expected 50 basis point to 100 basis point growth. And as you see, it's coming. So we're very pleased with that.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Yeah. Great quarter. Congratulations. Thanks.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you, Steve.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Steve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Morning, Andrew.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: You had an easier growth comparison in Health Care, but the acceleration in growth really is notable. I know you've been saying that you expect second half acceleration. But can you talk about whether this is simply your previous growth spending now really impacting the business? Or did you see an acceleration in Health Care markets? And can you talk about the sustainability of mid-single digit growth in this business moving forward?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yes. First of all, we have invested for quite some time in Health Care. And I think for Health Care specifically was the first business where we made additional investment that we broad based called core search. And that's paying off. And a lot of those investment was of course in developing economies. And we can see broad based that that's paying off. And we had \u2013 in the developing economy for the quarter, Health Care grew 12%, but they also grew in developed 6%. So our base is very strong in developed, specifically in United States and in West Europe. And we continue to grow very, very well there. And then you can see that the developing economy is coming as we planned. So I will say when we have talked about the range of 4% to 6%, that's a realistic plan. And then we will be in that range as we move forward. I have no doubt about that.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: All right. That's helpful. And then...\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Hey, Andrew, excuse me. I'll just add one thing. For the year, we're guiding Health Care 3% to 5%. And with the results we're about 4% growth through the first nine months of the year. We see ourselves solidly in the 3% to 5% range for 2017. Now and of course in the longer term, as Inge was just mentioning, the 4% to 6% is how we see growth in that business.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks for that, Nick. And then my follow-up is just on pricing again. You talked about U.S. pricing getting back closer to flat for the year, Nick, last quarter, which it does appear to be doing. But how much of the better pricing performance in the U.S. was 3M pulling back on rebating or discounting, versus just stronger overall Industrial and Consumer markets helping you? And do you think it's possible to get back to positive pricing in the U.S. in 2018?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. Andrew, we have been seeing slight incremental improvements in pricing in the U.S. And we continue to see that improving into the future. I wouldn't call it any kind of pullback on our part that's causing that to happen. It's in \u2013 it's a pricing environment where we see our business model, one where we have increased ability for price growth there. As far as 2018, I'm not ready to declare an up or down on that one. We'll talk more about that on December 12.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: All right. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Nice quarter.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. I will echo the xylophone of a solid, strong quarter. In any event \u2013 and I want to follow up on the pricing question as well. I mean obviously, you've been fairly contrite about perhaps not getting as much price as you wanted to get in the back half \u2013 or excuse me, the beginning part of the year. And you talked about catching up on that. And you've cited the 20 basis points. But could you talk maybe a little bit just structurally how you're thinking about your businesses? Where you think you're going to see pricing pressure over the next two years to three years? Obviously, the debate around kind of what is much more perceived as lending itself to transparency around Consumer, Industrial. And then kind of the rubber is meeting the road in Safety. But could you talk about where your moats are? And how you're feeling about it? Just maybe not in the context of what is a very strong kind of third quarter, fourth quarter right now, but just structurally down the road.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. Well, you should think about 3M as the price leader in most, if not all, categories we are in. And if you look \u2013 if you think about that historically and as we move ahead, it's very much based on our scientifically based business model. So for us, if you think about the new products, the new solution that we are providing, it's all in order to drive improved productivity and/or efficiency for our customers. Our business model is about understanding our customers' business model. We are by definition not a commoditized company. So we don't go in and fight on businesses where price is the primary discussion. We try to go in and make things different versus just making them better. So you do things better. But where the real value is when you do it different. That's also the time when you can drive price. So there is \u2013 and as you can see, our commitment to science, technology, and sustainability is continuing that wave forward. And you have also seen the portfolio work we have done here the last three years, four years, five years have been businesses that are more commoditized. We don't think that we can add as much value to them versus other companies. That's also why they have exited our portfolio. So I would say that there will be no change moving forward relative to our strategy around pricing. Now again, as you know and we know, things in between quarters can change slightly. But there is no big change relative to our strategy around pricing. It's very, very important for us. And it's important due to the fact it's part of our business model.\nRobert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Could \u2013 as a follow up maybe you could just talk about obviously the messaging for kind of your growth initiatives and continued commercialization. I suppose your outlook meeting will be around electrification. But could you talk about and maybe take it from the top for the portfolio where you see the most opportunities? And how we should be thinking about kind of quantifying what the longer term opportunity around electrification is?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Are you talking electrification, specifically?\nRobert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, for autos.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah, of course. If you think about that in terms of the mega trends and what we can do, we have three elements into that area specifically. We are very strong in automotive. We have showed that over time. We are outperforming automotive build quarter after quarter and year after year and within this quarter as well. So our connection into automotive is very strong. We have a strong technology platform in our Electronic & Energy that we then utilize through those contacts in order to build our platforms. And then the other thing that is easy to forget is that we are a global leader in traffic safety. And if you take those elements together, traffic safety, automotive electrification, and pull them together, that's exactly where the trends are going. And there is big platform for us to capitalize as we move ahead. So think about it in that perspective of I will say a certain thing that will \u2013 you and I will see today as we drive our cars. But also things that would come relative to the evolution of road safety in the automotive space.\nRobert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for squeezing me in.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please proceed.\nScott Davis - Melius Research LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Hey, Scott.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Hey, Scott.\nBruce Jermeland - 3M Co.: Scott.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Welcome back.\nScott Davis - Melius Research LLC: Thank you. It's nice to be back. Appreciate it. Inge, you finally seemed to crack the code on China. That was a region that was tough for you guys for a while. And boy, you've had a couple pretty good years there. I mean what do you attribute most of the success? I mean I know you mentioned some of this earlier in the call. But have you changed up your sales and marketing? Does it just take time to get brand awareness? And is it pricing strategy? I mean what outside of Electronics, obviously.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah.\nScott Davis - Melius Research LLC: But if you could just talk through that.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: So first of all, we've been in China for a long time as you know. I think we started our wholly owned subsidiary there in 1984 and have made investment over time. And we have good capabilities in terms of manufacturing there. And we have also a good research and development center there. Now it looked like \u2013 and as we had talked about before, that being there is not a shift. But there have been additional investment in China for what we would call domestic markets. So that will for us then benefit Health Care and Consumer specifically. And I think what is happening as we speak is that the consumers in there and the OEMs, they're becoming more demanding on performance, on quality, and functionality and brands. And that is going right into our business model in order for us to be more relevant. So we are capitalizing on that. We have also made additional investment in the domestic markets. Right? So you think about it in terms of everything that is produced and commercialized there. And we grow two times GDP and IPI (43:54) in the last couple of quarters. And we have shifted a portfolio to more Safety also in Health Care. So that's helping us in addition our own initiative. So that's type of, I would say, Chinese mega trends if you like. And then we, in addition, have made a lot of efforts on air quality, water quality, and automotive electrification. So you take that together, growth are coming. And it's very nice to see. So I think it's a focus, a presence and a focus, a commitment under the long term that now has start to pay off I think very much because of demanding for performance, quality, and functionality. And then as you say, brands are becoming more and more important. If you take air quality in China, it's equal to 3M. 3M stands for air quality in China. So that's actually our brand in China. And if you travel into China and you do some interviews, they will like to talk about respiratory products, about our things in filtration, et cetera. So I think it's coming back to brand awareness and the quality and functionality we're able to provide in the country.\nScott Davis - Melius Research LLC: That makes sense. And just to follow up on that, I mean one of the things you've been doing, Inge, is trying to get more locally designed products in each of the regions.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah.\nScott Davis - Melius Research LLC: Whether it be U.S., Europe, Asia, Latin America, and you've taken R&D up as a total spend, not just as a percent spend. But your revenues have grown, so you've taken it up meaningfully as a total spend. And how do you manage that structure, whereby you make sure you don't have guys working on duplicate projects? For air quality, for example, you've got guys in China working on new developments. And at the same time you've got guys in the U.S. working on the same things. I mean how do you really manage that complexity?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Well, we have our Senior Vice President from Research and Development that are managing the overall structure relative to how we do things. And there is very little duplication. And if you think about the science based off it, research and development, you think about research, there is four centers around the world that are doing the research. There's only four of them. Then you have \u2013 locally you will have capabilities for development. And that's a combination of the local business and the global division in order to manage that. So there is not duplication. And some time \u2013 to be honest, some time you can see duplication. But it's very, very seldom. And I think the advantage for us is sometime when someone is on something and find a solution for local market, we can replicate that other places. So will there be duplication sometime? Yes, I'm sure there will. But it's not much at all. And I think the evidence is there in terms of the outcome or the result.\nScott Davis - Melius Research LLC: Excellent. Keep up the good work, guys. Thank you.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nScott Davis - Melius Research LLC: Take care.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Morning, John.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. Morning, John.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Morning, Inge. So can we talk about investment spending in the quarter? I guess I thought you were going to be doing about $100 million. And you did $48 million. But maybe that was $100 million over two quarters. Maybe Nick could \u2013 what's going on there?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. For the total year we're on track for the total investment spending. We ended up having $40 million, mid-$40 million for investment spending for the third quarter. It's roughly a 50/50 mix of some of our footprint actions and the accelerated growth investments. And we're continuing to execute that plan. It's going according to the expectations we had for how this would play out for 2017. So I see it tracking just as we've planned it for the year.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, Nick, you didn't spend less than you had planned in the third quarter? And that's coming through in the fourth quarter? Or no?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: In the fourth quarter we expect that to go up slightly to now to be \u2013 I can \u2013 I'll put in cents, earnings per share terms. That'll be $0.06 to $0.10 or roughly $70 million to $110 million of total incremental strategic investments. That will be more heavily focused on footprint than on growth. Because on the growth side, John, we're starting to lap ourselves with some of the growth investments that we started later in 2016.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay so $70 million to $100 million. That's incremental year over year, correct? That's...\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: That is correct, John.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: It looks like inventory and receivables sort of sequentially as a function of sales maybe have moved up a little bit. Is that \u2013 I'm presuming that's, as a short cycle company, this is a response to channel fill. What is that? Is that new products that you're pushing through? Or is that actual pull-thorough from it could be a variety of sources. You're obviously a giant company, so it's hard to sort of parse that out. But what in fact is going on there? Is that just reflective of the global economy actually picking up?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. There is part of that that's the economy. So from an accounts receivable perspective, certainly our growth is the biggest driver of where we're seeing accounts receivable balances going up. On the inventory, that's also a function of the growth. The only thing on top of that I'd add is in the case of our business transformation effort, as we prepare to go-lives in different geographies around the world, one of the things we typically do is build some inventory in advance for our customers to ensure we can have an undisrupted supply chain for them. That's a little bit of what we're seeing right now.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: But I think important, John, is there is no channel fill by definition. We don't see anything in the channels that is abnormal for us. So I think that's important to put in place as well.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Well, if anything to your point, Inge, Consumer should have actually have had channel down fill, right? So is that still going on? And what was price in Consumer by the way?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: We don't typically put our price out by business group. And in the case of channel in the U.S., in the office supply channel we are continuing to see contraction there. Just not at the same level that we were seeing in the first half of this year, John.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I'll just ask one more, because that electrification of vehicle thing took up 17 questions. Gross margins, why were they down again this year for the first three quarters versus last year? Like, what's ultimately going on in the gross margin complexion of 3M today based on your businesses, you're spending versus last year? Why are they down? And do you think they will actually start to pick back up? Or is this all going to be about the OpEx management?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: John, I think you must be looking at our gross margin on an all-in published basis.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I am, yeah.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Part of what we've been doing this year is we have been doing a number of these supply chain footprint actions. Those costs are impacting our gross margin. When we strip that out, we are continuing to see slightly improving gross margins for 3M.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And that \u2013 when does that alleviate, Nick? When do you start to look at kind of a trend up on an all-in?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: In terms of our view on supply chain footprint actions, we originally laid out a year and a half ago that we expect between $500 million and $600 million of investments. We have done the majority, more than half of that, in 2017. So there will still be some footprint action expenses that we see in 2018. It will just be on a lower base than \u2013 a lower level than what we've seen in 2017. So it'll flip to become a tailwind for us from a margin perspective in 2018.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks and good morning, everyone.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Morning, Joe.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Joe.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So maybe touching on organic growth, clearly, really nice quarter and good acceleration. I guess if you look at the fourth quarter kind of implied guidance of call it like roughly 3.5% to 4%, a little bit of a deceleration, still good growth. But I'm just wondering like maybe you guys can comment on exit rates through the quarter and whether you're seeing anything interesting in the current rates.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Joe, in terms of trends that we saw throughout the third quarter and continuing into the first three weeks of the fourth quarter, we're seeing no change in trend. What you may be noticing in our guidance for the year is the fourth quarter will be our toughest comp for the entire year. But we're seeing no underlying deceleration in the trajectory of our sales revenue.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And maybe following on there, Nick, as the quarter progressed, was there any change throughout the quarter? Or was the quarter just pretty even throughout?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Joe, it was pretty strong throughout the quarter. There was no discernible trend between the different weeks or months of the third quarter. It was very even and strong throughout the quarter.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Great. And then maybe just shifting gears a little bit to capital allocation. Clearly Safety & Graphics over the last couple years has been an area where you guys have invested. Looks like you're taking down the buyback a little bit this year. I'm just wondering as you're thinking about M&A across the portfolio, perhaps maybe prioritize where you think you guys should be putting your M&A dollars moving forward?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Well, I think first of all, the pipeline for all businesses is very good. And as you correctly have illustrated it, we have done acquisitions in Safety & Graphics specifically but also in Health Care, even if they have been smaller. I'm now talking the last couple of years. I think Safety & Graphics as a business group now, we had Capital Safety added in and now Scott Safety coming on the base that we have for our very strong franchise in personal safety. We're in a good position there to continue to accelerate that growth. And I would say that we have interest in all five business groups in order to do some additional thing. But as I said, we have now to make sure in Safety & Graphics that we focused everything in order to execute the implementation and integration of those businesses. But more than that, we are open to see where we can add businesses, that is strategically important for us and that are aligned with our four fundamental strengths, which is technologies, manufacturing capabilities, geographic reach, and brand equity. So if we can drive a faster return and fast return for ourself to those four fundamentals, and they are in a strategically good position in our portfolio, we are very interested.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Inge, maybe how much of a limiting factor right now is valuation?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: I think always there \u2013 it's not now. There's always \u2013 whenever you talk about that, there is always a limitation to it. Right? There's \u2013 and I think it's important for you to really decide on where would you like to make it strategically. Right? So you can see some of the acquisitions we have made, we have looked upon the real value it can add to use. And then we have paid for it. Right? We are \u2013 in my mind we are world-class company. We are interested to buy world-class companies that we can integrate and drive forward. So then you need to pay a little bit more, but not too much.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of UBS. Please proceed.\nSteven Eric Winoker - UBS: Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Hey, Steve.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Hi, Steven.\nBruce Jermeland - 3M Co.: Morning, Steve.\nSteven Eric Winoker - UBS: Hey. I'll just \u2013 I'll keep it to two questions. The first one, Inge, you know 3M has faced I think a lot of skepticism around its ability to hold Health Care operating margin over time. So far you've proven that skepticism wrong. And as we're facing yet another sort of high level margin before the strategic investment for the quarter. So maybe comment a little bit on the pressures in Health Care globally? And how you're withstanding that? And your conviction going forward in the business' ability to continue to do that over time.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah, I think you're right. That, first of all, we've been in this business for a long time. It's a very attractive business to be in for reasons that we all know. The aging population trend, et cetera. I think the important thing is that you're able to provide at least two things. One is a benefit for the patient. And second, a benefit for the provider. And our portfolio is still right into those two things. That is what we do. And when you can add value even in an area like Health Care, which is very different than Industrial, you will be able to win in those segments. I don't know if you know, but I know that I was part, myself, of Health Care back in Europe in the early 1990s, 1991 to 1995 specifically. And there was a lot of pressure then through the German health care act. And what we had to do then was just, again, to prove the value for patients and for the provider and ourself, to be very efficient in the model in terms of manufacturing capabilities and logistics. And that's what we are doing. So when you look upon that specific business in terms of our growth rate, our margins, our cost of goods sold on SG&A, it's almost a perfect model for how you should do business in my mind. And you look upon that and you compare that to Safety & Graphics, they are soon at the same point. Not as high margins, but you can see the growth rate and very respectable margins of 25 plus percentage. It's again businesses that are regulated, it's about safety, it's about making sure that the patient or the worker always get the best. And people pay for that. And if you see Health Care, the acceleration we had in developing economy was 12%. The issue in developing economy is never quality, it's money. And as soon as the money is becoming available, 3M is one of the first products they will purchase into the system, based on key opinion leaders around the world writing papers of what is the best outcome in the treatment for patients.\nSteven Eric Winoker - UBS: Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, on I think a question also that you've tackled repeatedly. But given once again the strength in the quarter that's showing up, any thoughts going forward about revisiting taking on incremental leverage for growth investments going forward? You're I think below one time net debt to EBITDA?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah, Steve, you know our guidance of what we laid out for leverage over the course of five years. That we expect to add between $10 billion and $15 billion of leverage over that time. We've made progress in 2016 and progress on that in 2017 on that path. There's nothing changing on that front of seeing the capacity we have for adding that leverage.\nSteven Eric Winoker - UBS: Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, gents.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Morning.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Nigel.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I'll keep it \u2013 covered a lot of ground, so I'll keep this very brief. So we've tackled the question on sustainability of organic sales. And obviously your 4Q guidance doesn't assume it continues. But I'm just trying to understand what caused the acceleration. And I know that there was some timing differences on days in 2Q. But do you have any intelligence in terms of the broad portfolio in terms of sell-in versus sell-through? I know in Consumer you got good data. But what about more broadly in Industrial and Health Care channels, sell-in versus sell-through. And were there any pricing increases or rebate concessions that maybe might have distorted the course? Or was this really just good end market demand?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: This is good commercialization and market demand that we capitalize on. On sell-in and sell-out is often talked about relative to the retail and consumer lines. And there was no difference in this quarter for us relative to sell-out and very much the same in terms of sell-in as well, specifically in the office supply channel. But there is nothing here in terms of us pushing something into the system in terms of any specific activities. As and I said earlier, we \u2013 our business model is around creating value for the end customer and for the OEMs in the industry. So there is nothing else here that is pushing the growth up. And as you can see, it's broad based. If you think about we have EEBG [Electronics & Energy business group] of 13%. We have Health Care of 7%; IBG [Industrial business group] and Safety/Graphic at 6%. And then Consumer, 2%. And you look upon geographically, APAC, 13%. And if you take out Electronics, it's still 8%. And then you have Latin America/Canada at 5%, United States, 4%, and Europe/Middle East/Africa, 4%. So it's broad based and it's all businesses, which is very, very encouraging for us.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: No. No question. That's great detail. Thanks, Inge. And then on \u2013 Nick, on the raws, the $0.03 of benefit in 3Q. Obviously great job by the team. What does your plan embed for 4Q, just given the inflation we've seen post hurricane?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: And, Nigel, could you repeat that, the $0.03 benefit from what?\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Raw materials.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: From raw materials. Yeah. We think that will \u2013 we think that will be flat to some benefit for us in Q4 and probably a little bit of a mixed dynamic there. As I said, we've seen pricing continuing to benefit. So from a price raw material, I think we'll still see increasing benefit from our selling prices. On the raw material benefit, we continue to see that as a tougher and tougher comp for us. Up until now, it's been offset by the projects we're doing, as I mentioned earlier. That will likely sustain. But I wouldn't be surprised if the benefit from that came \u2013 the net benefit came down slightly in the fourth quarter.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Deane.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Hey, Deane.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey. I know we're into overtime here, so I'll keep it to one question. Can you talk about oral care in the U.S.? And how were you impacted by the ongoing distributor changes that's been causing stocking and restocking? And might you have picked up any more market share during this commotion?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. Deane, I wouldn't say that we're in a position where we're declaring that we've picked up market share in the recent months or quarters. I would say this is a strong global business for us. And we are \u2013 we see lots of demand for our oral care solutions around the globe. The U.S. is down slightly in our oral care business. And it's a business where we haven't seen quite the channel fluctuations that you might be talking about. It's been pretty stable for us. The biggest driver for us in our oral care business is our demand in emerging markets and other parts of the world.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. And our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Hello, Mr. Alexander? Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.\nLaurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: So good morning, guys. So two quick ones if I may.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah.\nLaurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: The soft spots in your business, the stationery and the office and the commercial solutions in the safety and protection.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah.\nLaurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: To what extent are those still core? Or how do they fit in the macro driven, mega trend driven, science-based growth that you were describing earlier?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah.\nLaurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: And secondly, what are your criteria for adding new materials to your 46 technology platforms?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. Well, if you \u2013 relative to the two divisions, if you start with the division in Safety & Graphics, that's a division that have a very strong precision with films that is one of our core technologies. If that is \u2013 in this case, is film for decoration, for brand equity building, but it's also the same type of I will say equipment and asset we are using for all our light management businesses. So that's a business that is very strong for us. And if you look upon the underlaying capabilities in order to produce those product, that's core to 3M. So there is no question around that business. And there is no question about office and supply either. That is where you have the Post-it. That's where we have the Scotch Tape, et cetera. So those are brand equity big businesses that we earn good money with. And our customers are on very, very good margins with them as well. So if you think about that from a perspective, also those businesses in stationery products, they are based on technologies that are very solid for 3M as an enterprise. So there is not even a question relative if they belong to 3M or not. So that's that answer. In terms of building out technology platforms, we have 46 as you said. In some cases, if we need to build out something, we will look upon that. And I think the latest \u2013 we have a couple of them during the last couple of years. One is the ceramic business, where we bought one company that in fact had a defense business of around $450 million. So we purchased that. What we really purchased was actually a technology platform that we'll deepen and broaden what we already had ourself in the ceramic. And that that could be used for many, many, many divisions. And we did one in Lebrona (1:09:00) that is a filter capabilities that we built into filtration and non-woven (1:09:07) capabilities, et cetera. So if we see a need to add something that we not can do our self or take too long time for us, we will go out and look for that. But again it's built on the demand from the market and where the market going for the future. It's not us sitting internally and look upon what we are doing and, yes, try to see what we should add.\nLaurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the question and answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for some closing comments\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. To wrap up, our team executed very well across enterprise and delivered another strong performance in the third quarter, including robust organic growth, increased earnings per share, and rising margins. The 3M playbook is working, and we are well-positioned going into 2018. Thank you for joining us. And I look forward to seeing you all in New York on December 12 for our outlook meeting. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the 3M Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, July 25, 2017. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland - 3M Co.: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2017 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO, and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our future investor events. Please turn to slide 2. First, starting with earnings, our Q3 earnings conference call will be held on October 24, the Q4 call will be next year on January 25. And lastly, our 2018 outlook meeting will take place on December 12. Please mark your calendars. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to slide 4, and I'll hand the call off to Inge.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. For 3M the second quarter was marked by strong organic growth of 4% with positive growth across all five business groups. At the same time, we took a number of actions to better position our enterprise for success in both the short and long-term. This includes accelerated strategic investments to support growth and strengthening our portfolio along with M&A. I will now take you through some of the numbers. As I mentioned, organic growth across the company was 4% led by Electronics and Energy at 8%. Industrial, and Safety and Graphics continued to grow well posting organic growth of 4% and 3% respectively. Health Care also grew 3% and it was good to see our Consumer business turn positive with 1% organic growth. Company-wide total sales in U.S. dollars were $7.8 billion, up 2% year-on-year. We delivered earnings of $2.58 per share along with margins of 28%. Note that these results include impacts from both M&A and strategic investments, which Nick will cover in more detail. Excluding those impacts, core operating margins remained strong at more than 24%. Turning to free cash flow, we posted a good conversion rate of 85% in the second quarter. Our healthy cash flow enabled us to invest in enterprise by also returning significant cash to our shareholders. And in the second quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. That concludes my opening remarks and I will now turn the call over to Nick who will take us through more of the numbers. Nick?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Thanks, Inge, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 5. As Inge mentioned, GAAP earnings for the quarter were $2.58 per share. Since we had several moving parts this quarter, I thought I would take a moment to cover each item to make our underlying second quarter performance as clear as possible. As Inge mentioned, we continue to execute our plans in Q2 to strengthen the company for the future. During the quarter, we made incremental strategic investments of $178 million; $39 million was growth related and $139 million related to portfolio and footprint actions. For the second half of the year, we anticipate another $0.20 to $0.25 per share impact from incremental strategic investments, largely footprint related. These actions drive greater productivity from our manufacturing and supply chain base and will improve our service to our customers. Looking ahead, we expect footprint actions to be, at a minimum, an expense of $0.10 per share in 2018. This expectation includes benefits from actions implemented in 2017. In addition, we had divestiture related activity in the quarter which added $0.57 to GAAP earnings per share, of which $0.54 relates to the identity management business. Taking into account these items, underlying earnings were $2.25 per share, up 8.2% year-on-year. Please turn to slide 6 for a recap of our quarterly sales performance. We posted good organic growth in the quarter of 3.5%, with volumes up a solid 3.8%. Selling prices were down 30 basis points year-on-year due to a couple of factors. Strong volume growth in electronics had a negative impact on price, and we saw less price growth in Latin America as currencies were more stable versus the U.S. dollar. We continued to actively manage the portfolio in Q2 and divested some non-strategic businesses which reduced sales by 100 basis points. Foreign currency translation decreased sales by another 60 basis points. All in, second quarter sales, in U.S. dollars, increased 1.9% versus last year. In the U.S., organic growth was 1.9%, led by a mid-single digit increase in Industrial. Our Health Care and Safety and Graphics businesses delivered low single-digit growth in the quarter. The Consumer business was down 1% organically in the U.S. in Q2, impacted by continued channel adjustments in the office market. Asia Pacific led the company with organic growth of 10% in Q2. All business groups within APAC posted strong growth in the quarter, including a double-digit increase in Electronics and Energy and high single-digit growth in each of our other four business groups. Organic growth was 17% in China/Hong Kong and 8% in Japan. Excluding our electronics related businesses, China/Hong Kong grew 12% and Japan was up 4%. Moving to EMEA, organic growth declined 2% in Q2, with a similar result in West Europe. This area experienced fewer billing days versus last year due to the timing of the Easter holiday. Through the first half of the year, EMEA grew 1% organically, led by our Safety and Graphics and Industrial businesses. Finally, Q2 organic growth in Latin America/Canada was 4%, with all businesses posting positive growth. Health Care led the way, up high single-digits and Consumer grew mid-single digits. At a country level, Mexico continued to deliver strong organic growth at 8%. Brazil was up 6% while Canada grew 3%. We continue to generate broad-based growth across the globe, giving us confidence in our full-year expectations, which Inge will discuss later. Please turn to slide 7 for the second quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide second quarter sales were $7.8 billion with net income of $1.6 billion, up 23%. On a GAAP basis, second quarter operating margins were 28%, or 24.3% year-over-year excluding the previously mentioned impact from incremental strategic investments and divestitures. Let's take a closer look at the various components of our margin performance in the second quarter. Gains from organic volume growth and productivity contributed 60 basis points to operating margins. Lower raw material costs net of selling price changes added another 10 basis points. Foreign currency net of hedge gains brought margins down 50 basis points in the quarter, while higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense decreased margins by 30 basis points. Finally, incremental strategic investments reduced margins by 2.3 percentage points and divestiture related activity benefited margins by 6 percentage points. Let's now turn to slide eight for a closer look at earnings per share. Second quarter GAAP earnings were $2.58 per share, including a net earnings benefit of $0.33 per share from the combined impact of gains on divestitures which were partially offset by incremental strategic investments and non-repeating lost operating earnings. Excluding these items, our operating EPS was $2.25, up 8.2% year-on-year. The combination of organic growth and productivity contributed $0.08 per share to Q2 earnings. Business transformation continues to have a positive impact on our productivity efforts. Foreign currency, net of hedging, reduced pre-tax earnings by $0.05 a share. Our Q2 tax rate was 26% versus 29.6% in the prior year, which increased earnings by $0.12 per share. The lower tax rate was driven by favorable geographic profit mix, our supply chain centers of expertise, and ongoing strategic tax initiatives. For the first half of the year, our tax rate was 25%. We now expect the full-year tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27% versus a prior range of 26% to 27.5%. Finally, lower shares outstanding and higher interest expense together had a net $0.02 positive impact to EPS. Please turn to slide 9 for a look at cash flow. We continue to generate solid operating cash flow as a company, which allows us to consistently invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. Second quarter free cash flow was $1.3 billion, up $378 million year-on-year. Free cash flow conversion was 85% in the quarter. And for the full year, we now anticipate free cash flow conversion to be in the range of 95% to 100%, versus 95% to 105% previously. The adjustment to the high end of the range is primarily due to the gain on sale of identity management. Second quarter capital expenditures were $302 million, and for the full year we continue to anticipate CapEx investments in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. During the quarter, we paid $701 million in cash dividends to shareholders and also returned $494 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases. In the first half of the year, we repurchased $1.2 billion in stock and now expect full-year repurchases to be in the range of $2 billion to $3.5 billion versus $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion previously. Let's now review our performance by business group. Please turn to slide 10. Industrial, our largest business group, continued its strong growth delivering second quarter sales of $2.7 billion, up 3.8% organically. Industrial's growth was once again broad-based across all geographic areas and nearly all businesses. Advanced materials led the way with low double-digit growth in the quarter. The automotive and aerospace solutions business grew mid-single digits in the quarter as we continue to grow the market. Our Heartland businesses within Industrial, all posted positive organic growth in the quarter. Industrial adhesives and tapes grew mid-single digits, and abrasives and automotive aftermarket, each grew low single digits. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by Asia Pacific and the U.S. Industrial delivered second quarter operating income of $523 million with an operating margin of 19.2%. Adjusting for incremental strategic investments, operating margins were 21.5%, down nearly 200 basis points year-on-year. Half of the decline was due to foreign currency with the remainder from mix and select pricing actions to drive volume growth. Looking ahead, we expect operating leverage in the business to improve in the second half of the year. Please turn to slide 11. Second quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.5 billion with organic growth of 3.2%. Organic growth was led by our personal safety business which again delivered high single-digit growth in the quarter. We continue to experience strong demand for our personal safety solutions across the world with particular strength in Asia Pacific, up double digits, followed by high single-digit growth in the U.S. In transportation safety, we continue to take actions to improve the portfolio. In Q2 we finalized the sale of the identity management and tolling businesses and announced the exit of electronic monitoring. For almost 80 years, 3M has pioneered industry-leading solutions to improve road safety and mobility. We continue to focus on the rapidly changing trends in transportation safety and mobility including the connected roadways of the future. Finally, Q2 organic growth in our commercial solutions business was flat while the roofing granules business declined, primarily due to tough year-on-year comps. Geographically, Safety and Graphics grew organically in all areas led by a 9% increase in Asia Pacific. Second quarter profits in Safety and Graphics more than doubled year-on-year to $852 million, boosted by divestiture gain. Adjusting for these items and strategic investments year-on-year, operating margins were 27.1%. Please turn to slide 12. Our Health Care business generated second quarter sales of $1.4 billion. Organic growth was 2.5% year-on-year. Organic growth was led by a double-digit increase in drug delivery systems followed by food safety which was up high single-digits. Our medical consumables businesses which represent the largest segment within Health Care, posted 3% organic growth in Q2. Health Information Systems was flat year-on-year and delivered sequential improvement. Looking ahead, we expect organic growth to improve in this business throughout the balance of the year as our contract pipeline continues to build. Oral care was flat in Q2 with the first half of the year up 2%. Geographically, Health Care was led by high single-digit organic growth in both Asia Pacific and Latin America/Canada. The U.S. grew 3% and EMEA declined mid-single digits. We saw a notable strength in China/Hong Kong and Latin America which were both up double digits in the quarter. Health Care's operating income was $412 million and operating margins were 28.6%. Adjusting for strategic investments year-on-year, operating margins were 30.6%. Please turn to slide 13. Electronics and Energy continued to lead our company with second quarter organic growth of 8.4%, resulting in sales of $1.2 billion. The electronics side of the business grew 15% organically, as our team continued to drive increased penetration on many OEM platforms. For example, our Novec specialty fluid grew high teens as we continue to see strong demand for its many applications. Demand strengthened across most market segments in consumer electronics and we continue to benefit from favorable year-on-year comps. Our energy related businesses were down 3% organically with electrical flat while telecom declined. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by a double-digit increase in Asia Pacific which is where our electronics business is concentrated. Latin America/Canada grew slightly, U.S. was flat while EMEA declined. Second quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $301 million with operating margins of 24.8%. As you can see, Q2 was another strong quarter for our Electronics and Energy business. Please turn to slide 14. Second quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion with organic growth of 0.7% which was an improvement versus recent quarters. We continue to see positive organic growth in three of our four consumer businesses namely home improvement, home care, and consumer health care. As expected, our stationery and office supplies business was again impacted by channel inventory reductions in the U.S. office retail and wholesale channels, although these growth headwinds were lower in Q2 versus Q1. We expect to see these channel adjustments continue, but to have less of an impact in the back half of the year. We are seeing a good return on accelerated investments in some of our key category defining brands. For example, our Command damage-free mounting products posted strong double-digit growth and we also delivered good growth in Scotch-Brite cleaning products. Geographically, organic growth in Consumer was led by Asia Pacific and Latin America/Canada, both up high single-digits. This growth was partially offset by declines in the U.S. and EMEA. Finally, operating income was $195 million with an operating margin of 17.2%. Adjusting for strategic investments year-on-year, operating margins were 22.2%. Please turn to slide 15 and I will now turn the call back over Inge. Inge?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you, Nick. As I look upon the first six months of the year, I'm pleased with the performance from our global team. We are successfully executing the 3M playbook while delivering strong growth and premium returns. On the left hand side of this chart, you see the first half numbers. Robust earnings of $4.74 per share. Organic growth of 4%, margins of more than 25%, up 130 basis points year-on-year or up 40 basis points excluding the impact of M&A and strategic investments, and a free cash flow conversion rate of 70%. Equally important, we were active in taking action to strengthen 3M today and into the future. As you heard Nick discussed, we accelerated strategic investments in the first half which include an incremental $75 million to support growth in core platforms. This growth investments will continue throughout the year and they will contribute 50 basis points to 100 basis points of growth in 2017. We also invested another $239 million in the first half to optimize our portfolio and manufacturing footprint. This is part of the five-year plan we laid out in March of 2016 at our investor day in St. Paul, and we are making good progress executing that plan. These investments are important to strengthen the long-term competitiveness of our enterprise. Beyond strategic investment, we also continue to make good progress on our three key levers. The first is portfolio management and in March we announced the acquisition of Scott Safety which should close in the second half of this year. This acquisition will complement organic growth and further improve our position in the fast-growing personal safety market. In the first half, we also finalized three divestitures and announced another one. Ultimately, selling the businesses will allow us to focus on our biggest and best opportunities and create the greatest value for our shareholders. Investing in innovation is the second lever. In the first half, we invested $944 million in research and development or 6% of sales. These investments support organic growth while enabling us to deliver premium margins and return on invested capital. The third lever is business transformation which starts and ends with our customers. At our Investor Day last month in Neuss, Germany, many of you saw the good progress we are making with the rollout of the ERP system in West Europe. Our business transformation plan is on track and I remain confident going forward. In summary, our team delivered a strong first half performance. We're executing our strategies, building for the future and posting a good financial performance. As a result, today we are raising the bottom end of our full-year guidance for both earnings per share and organic growth which you will see on slide 16. With respect to EPS, we now anticipate earnings of $8.80 to $9.05 per share, up 8% to 11% versus last year, against the prior range of $8.70 to $9.05. Organic growth is estimated to be 3% to 5%, up from the previous range of 2% to 5%. And as you can see, we continue to expect strong results in terms of both return on invested capital and free cash flow conversion for the full year. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, guys.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Andy.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Nick, can you give us more color on what's going on with your ability to price? You mentioned the electronics pricing impact in APAC, the U.S. pricing continues to drift down. You did preview price versus raw as getting less positive as the year went on and it did stay positive during the quarter, but could you talk about your confidence that it will stay positive as the year continues? And then the negative pricing, you're seeing more choice and a market share gain for you or is it simply more competition?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah, Andy, in the case of pricing both for the quarter and for the year, we're not \u2013 if I think about 3M's business model, where we take technology, use that to create value for the customers, that ultimately creates our fundamental pricing power. That hasn't changed. That remains strong. For the second quarter, we saw price down 30 basis points and as you mentioned we saw it down approximately 40 basis points in the U.S. On a global basis, what we're seeing, Andy, is two main things that have changed from first quarter are strong growth in electronics which was much more of a price down that the other businesses that we saw that strong volume growth there contributed to more negative price growth in Asia Pacific. And then in Latin America, where we often see price growth often driven by a weakening currencies against the U.S. dollar, we saw much more stable currencies there versus the U.S. dollar, so some of the corresponding price growth we see didn't materialize. The core price growth and this gets into what we saw in the United States. Core price growth, we traditionally see somewhere between 30 basis points and 50 basis points of core price growth. In the U.S., we see ourselves now tracking to the low end of what we've been expecting for price growth. We expect it to be closer to flat for the total year in the U.S. And we are taking in some markets selected price adjustments to gain market share, to accelerate volume growth. Some examples are our Industrial business and our Consumer business.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, Nick. That's helpful. And then, Inge, can you give us a little more color on what's going on in your Health Care business? You've talked about seeing an acceleration in that business? Health Care also seems like the biggest target for your growth investments that are supposed to boost growth in that segment this year, yet you did see some deceleration in the quarter. Obviously, the deceleration looks oral care related, maybe that's shift Easter, but your growth investments, are they having their intended effect and could you still see some acceleration in that business in the second half here?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yes, we will see acceleration of that business in the second half. And it is a very strong business for us. And you're right, we have made investment now for quite some time and in fact in Q2 we peaked that investment moving forward. So we see a couple of things happening for us. The accelerated investment for growth is now in a way hitting the peak for us, and you will see some of the business is really picking up in the second part of the year. And we have some easier comparison as well. So you comment on oral care and, as you'll recall, all will recall, we had a very strong first quarter, almost 5% growth, second quarter was flat. And I think when you look upon that there is of course an impact, as we talked about billing days and selling days in West Europe due to Easter specifically. But I also think you saw in the United States end-user demand was down in the second quarter due to the reduction of restorative procedures. So I think, if you take those together, the growth for oral care after the first two quarter is 2%. So clearly, we are continuing to grow and we take market share. So I'm not overly concerned about that shift in between Q1 and Q2 for that business. And Health Care will do very well as we move ahead into the second part of the year. So we're on plan and it look good for us.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Inge.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, John.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys. I'd like to pick up on the price theme just for a second. I think you have to go back to 2008 to see net price negative. And I guess I'm curious to know, are you guys \u2013 are you cutting price because your products are too expensive? Or because competitors have cut price? Or the underlying markets are changing out from under you? Maybe a little more color as to what's the context and nature of these adjustments? And in theory price cuts just don't happen on a one-time basis, there's a certain degree of perpetualness to it, right? Maybe you could help frame the durational context in your minds.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah, John, you know as well as I do, it's a competitive world. We're constantly working to, how can we gain the market share that we think our products should be having? In this kind of competitive world, we keep looking for \u2013 where are there opportunities where price could have been a barrier for us taking market share? And in a couple of businesses I mentioned, Industrial and Consumer as well as Electronics in Asia, we look for where there are those opportunities. Partly how I think about this, John, we're also through our investments to accelerate growth as we're investing more dollars to commercialize many of our existing product lines. In some of those cases we looked at where are there opportunities where price \u2013 our current price position could be a barrier to us reaching the maximum market share potential that we felt we could attain. And we're making those selected adjustments. I do think we are at probably the peak of the price declines that we've taken to do that. I don't see much further downward pressure from the momentum we've had. And if anything, I see the second half of the year with some uptick in that pricing.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So if I read between what you're saying, it sounds like you're saying that as you're looking at sort of strategy in the future, you said, hey, certain product lines in these categories are going to face upward limits if we don't actually adjust prices lower. So in other words, competitors weren't putting pressure on you, although maybe that happened thoughtfully (34:22), but this is very much 3M driving the strategic pricing, is that fair?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah, John, I think the fair way to characterize it is, these are 3M decisions we're making not responses we're making in the market. These are 3M driven actions.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Understood. And then next, just the decline in share repurchase for the year kind of at the midpoint, what exactly are you signaling if anything? And maybe you could remind us what exactly is your dividend policy? Your stock's done incredibly well, but now your yield is kind of \u2013 it's bordering on below-average. I mean, is it a payout formula? Or is it a yield function? Or maybe you could just remind us again please.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: I'll talk broadly on returning cash to shareholders and then go into specifically what you're asking on the dividend, and the share repurchases. So you know for us, John, returning cash to shareholders is a priority and we do it both through dividends and we do it through share repurchases. On the dividend front, we've reached a point where we think our dividend payout ratio is in the zone that we want it to be, and future increases in our dividend over time, we expect to be very similar to what we anticipate for earnings per share growth. So in the coming years, we expect our dividend to grow in line with earnings over time. On the share repurchase front, that's more dynamic for us, and you've probably heard me say this before, we have a two-fold strategy there. We do maintain a consistent presence in the market with a base level of repurchases, and then we augment that with opportunistic buyback based on relative value. We continually assess the market valuation through our own analysis, comparing it to how the stock is trading, and over time, we've found that to be a good risk-adjusted basis to be creating value. Now, in the case of lower purchases, both for the quarter and for the year, we adjusted the full-year range down based on where we stand through the first half of the year. The market has been strong and we're exercising discipline. And we anticipate that there will continue to be opportunities in the future to effectively deploy capital to maximize those returns. I would also add that our allocation of capital to share buyback is also influenced by other demands on capital such as M&A.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So in other words, Nick, is the money you're going to save from share repo this year, is that sort of earmarked for something else? Or is it kind of a wait and see then?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: There's a bit of a wait and see on that, John, that we still plan to be putting significant capital into share repurchases. We have announced our planned acquisition of Scott Safety, which we anticipate to happen in the second half of the year. But as you know, this type of market, there can be dynamics, so we are keeping our options open for the second half of the year.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yes, we'd like to have flexibility, John, as we move ahead.\nJohn G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely, makes sense. Thank you very much.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. In terms of the strategic investments, you have spoken a lot about it on the call and it's been consistent with kind of your contemplation through the first half of the year. Could you talk about specifically what kind of returns you're looking for on these investments, whether paybacks or ROI? And talk about are the nature of the investments truly growth investments or there's some restructuring involved as well in certain areas where perhaps demand is not what you're thinking it is?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Rob, you can think of our growth investments this year in two big components. One is our investments in growth, and that's the minority part of the investment and it's aligned with what we originally guided back in December about an incremental $100 million that we anticipate to be spending in growth investments. There's a number of core product platforms we have that we're investing in commercialization dollars in some cases that can be advertising, merchandising, in some cases it can be people involved in adding people in the actual selling process of our products. And we anticipate that that will add 50 basis points to 100 basis points to our growth for the total year, and that's factored into our guidance now. And through the first half of the year, Rob, we're seeing our growth and our expenditures on that front tracking very much in line. But that's the minority of our total strategic investments. The more significant thing on strategic investments for us in 2017 is the actions we're taking in optimizing our manufacturing supply chain footprint. And that aligns with what we shared in March of 2016 when we laid out our five-year plan. And in optimizing our footprint and our manufacturing base, we anticipated over a period of the next few years we'd be investing between $500 million and $600 million, in some cases closing manufacturing sites and shifting manufacturing and expanding manufacturing in our more efficient sites, ultimately to reduce our total manufacturing footprint, to improve efficiency and to improve our ability to service our customers. Most of what you're seeing under strategic investments fits under that strategy. We took a number of actions in the second quarter, and in terms of the return, the way we've quantified that there's a couple ways I can quantify that for you, Rob. One is, by 2020 we anticipate that this will increase our operating income annually between $125 million and $175 million. That's one way for you to think of it. Another way is that we anticipate that this will be greater than a 30% return on investment for the investment that we're taking on this footprint optimization.\nRobert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's very thorough. Thank you. I mean, I guess the other question in the context of some of these pricing discussions that John and Andy alluded to, you'll find that investors in the space generally have a lot of PTSD when it comes to Amazon with respect to the distribution disruption that's going on across the board, and we see price concessions or a pricing regime of sorts in consumer, industrial businesses. Can you talk about your \u2013 are you rethinking distribution and the sensitivity to price or going direct? Or anything along those lines that would kind of orient why you think this is a forward thinking 3M movement that you're kind of looking at things and saying maybe the business is changing, or maybe the environment is changing, we're going to get ahead of this and have more concessions on price or maybe do value engineering around new products to drive better growth. Could you just comment on that?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: This is Inge. Let us first of all talk about what is going on in the marketplace. And as you talked about initially, consumer if you like, what is going on in the retail and consumer space. When you lead a business in totality, it's not price that you initially think about, you think about structure. And if you take our Consumer business, in order to adjust our structure for the future we started that back in 2012. So 2012 was when we start to look upon our Consumer business in terms of how do we operate, and how do we think the future will look like, and how can we become more relevant to our customers? That was the question. At that time we had nine divisions in consumer, today we have four. So you think about that in terms of evolution of the portfolio. We started back very early to adjust for future that eventually could look different. And as you heard in the result today, there's slight difference in it in terms of consolidation for us as we have three or four business divisions growing. It's basically the office supply that still consolidation is going on. We have not seen any either in Consumer or in Industrial, any differences relative to the power for us to drive growth. We're often a price leader and we're executing those plans. So we don't see differences there. And if you think about 3M generally speaking as a business, 70% of our business is either design or specked in or regulated. So if you think about it from that perspective, it's a smaller portion of 3M that eventually could be impacted. And we will adjust relative to that. But we're not thinking of going on price because that's not our business model. Our business model is to introduce a product that is adding value either through different design or improved productivity, and then we're driving price based on that. But your question is on price, and I would say we are adjusting our business models as we move forward. And often that is for us the structure in commercialization and it's also footprint, right? So you saw the investment we are doing here and the first question relative to return on that $500 million to $600 million with an annual return by 2020 of in between $125 million to $175 million. Those are important things for us to improve our competitiveness as we move forward.\nRobert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your time.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Hi, Nigel.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So I hate to return to the same pricing, but I just don't think I've ever heard 3M trying to drive volumes or market share gains through price, so I'm wondering are you taking here a decision to invest some of the raw material goodness, the deflation in raw materials into price and hence market share? And just may be, Nick, thinks about that $0.10, $0.15 of raw material deflation benefit in the plan, how does that look on a net basis versus price at this point?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. For the raw materials, the $0.10 to $0.15 that we anticipated of benefits at the beginning of the year, there's been puts and takes as we go along on the raw material side, but so far we're still seeing ourselves in that range of $0.10 to $0.15. I'd say, the potential were, in the last couple of years were we could go past that number, I don't see that is a very high probability. I see this in this range, maybe $0.10 being a little towards the bottom end of that range based on what we're seeing in the raw material markets today. On the pricing front, I don't know what to repeat, but other than there have been these isolated places where we've taken action. In the second half of the year, we expect a more normal price growth for 3M as we've put in plan some actions to be bringing price back to a more normal level that we've historically experienced in 3M. So I don't see much changing on that front from our original guidance, Nigel.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's fair. And just to clarify, when you say normal, do you mean the 30 bps to 50 bps ex-FX, will that be the second half of the year? Or is that more 2018? And then maybe just clarify as well the comment you made on the investment spending in 2018, you said $0.10. Now, is that $0.10 on top of the $0.05 to $0.10 run rate or $0.10 total?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: On the strategic investment around growth, when we started the year we said that we expected that to be an incremental $0.10 expense and we continue to expect it to be that incremental $0.10. We're not increasing that number any further. And then on the price growth, Well, I'd say it is a more normal range, I do think it'll still be to the lower end on price growth in the second half of the year, approaching in the positive zone, but not up to the whole 30 basis points to 50 basis points that we normally are getting for core price growth.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's very helpful. Thanks, Nick.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Steve.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: So when you think about the Industrial business and I guess you can kind of throw Safety and Graphics in there as well, how much of that business currently goes through kind of the proper industrial distributors? And then how has that kind of trended relative to online and the Amazons of the world over the last, call it, two years here, three years, in rough terms?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yes. This is Inge. If you think about \u2013 you combine the two businesses which is a good way to look upon it, I would say that think about it like a 50-50 model, if you think on it globally. Some countries will have more distribution than others. But if you think about the two businesses combined and how we go to market, I think it's 50-50 generally speaking. Again, if you take many businesses in both Industrial and in Safety and Graphics, they are spec in or designed in or also regulated in a way. So the push will maybe happen for some consumables that will go through e-business channels, if you like. But we have not seen a big trend in that space as of yet. Maybe it will come, but I think then you have to think about how will that impact you relative to what you do with your end customers. But we are prepared to move in that direction. And if you look upon our business in the second quarter, if you take the two businesses you're talking about, the increase relative to e-business was 9%, and they estimate it to be 14% for the second half of the way. But you have to think about it also, that piece today for us is 2% to 3% of our total business what we do e-business direct ourselves. Many, many of our customers are of course finding the platforms themselves but they will not impact us by definition as we see at this point in time on price levels.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: So when we think about kind of what's going on in the world going back to Rob's question around the higher level strategic type of stuff, Grainger obviously came out and made some headlines talking about cutting price to drive growth. They have a great franchise historically. I mean, you guys obviously have one of the greatest franchises ever and you're talking about cutting price to drive growth. Is this just coincidence? Is this just kind of the macro environment that we're in? Or are these in some way linked to what's become a much more dynamic competitive environment in the Industrial or even Consumer channels if you want to throw Consumer in there as well. Any relationship there at all? Has Grainger at all called you and said, hey, let's take some of the pain because I know you guys go to them a bit. It's just \u2013 this deflationary environment is just something new for all of us, I think, over the last (51:44).\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: I cannot comment on Grainger, but of course in business, generally speaking, that would be more dynamic as you move ahead, right? I think we see that specifically in the retail area at this point in time. And then I think different company will have different impacts, right? If you think about what we're all about relative to our portfolio, as I said, a lot of it is spec in, design in and regulated. So by definition, to drive that in terms of price down, that's where you have to hold back to your technology platforms, to your brand equity, et cetera. So I don't see a direct correlation as you talk about this quarter to be honest. But I will agree to as we move ahead that in all businesses, in health care or electronics or consumer, industrial, dynamics will happen and we have to adjust to that and that's what we're doing by the way, right? When you see some of our investments in terms of strategic investment for the future is to make sure we are more competitive as we move ahead. And we take action on most things in terms of our infrastructure to make sure we drive out as much cost as we can, flatten the organization and make sure we have a more agile execution model as we move ahead. So you're prepared for whatever is coming at you, right. And as I always have said, when you take those actions, do it when you can not only must. So we are taking some of those \u2013 we do it now because we can and prepare ourselves for a much, much better, more competitive and more agile 3M as we move ahead. Will pricing be one part of those and be driven by the market? Well, let's see. But important thing that you have all your fundamentals in place so you can complete.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. And, Nick, just very quickly, just in the second half, the comps get just a little bit tougher yet you're kind of into the high end of the range even though the first half growth is more at the midpoint of the new range. So should we just kind of ignore the comps and assume that things accelerate in the second half of the year despite that? Do you see the true economy getting better in the second half? It just would seem that your peak growth rate probably happened in the first quarter. Maybe I'm wrong about that from a timing perspective \u2013 or days sales or something.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah, when it comes to the comps, there's a couple of different things going on. One, like for instance our Electronics and Industrial, both of those, I agree with you, we're going to have slightly tougher comps in the second half of the year. In the case of Consumer and in Health Care, both of those will be seeing easier comps. I wouldn't call it a big statement on our fact that we're seeing an improving economy. We're seeing a fairly stable economy outlook for the balance of the year. Our move in the organic growth range to now would be 3% to 5% and take us confidence in our ability to maintain the growth trajectory even with the tougher comp that we'll be facing, primarily in the fourth quarter.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot guys. Thanks for the detail.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Deane.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Hi, Deane.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Just to start off in Consumer with the U.S. being down 1%, this is seasonally where we see a back-to-school impact in Consumer. How did that play out in the quarter? We've seen industry reports where spending has been higher year-over-year, and want to see how that rippled through for you guys?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: So we're not through that, but I think the headline there is that this is the strongest we've seen in the past and maybe slightly stronger. I think, what you see is if you compare maybe the last couple of years versus five, six years ago, is that they wait longer to make the purchase today versus three, four, five years ago. So we will see more growth coming for that category specifically. If you look upon our performance for Consumer in United States, we can basically go right down to the office supply by definition. So there's nothing else going on there. And when you talk about back-to-school, it looks very solid for us.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Good to hear. And then a follow-up question, Inge, there was some interesting announcements regarding succession planning at 3M this quarter, looks orderly, looks well signaled, especially compared to the past. Can you comment on these announcements? Maybe specifically on expectations regarding timing?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Well, first of all the announcement was not about succession planning. The announcement was around we have a job to do. And if you saw the two announcements we did, we announced Mike Roman to take on the growth piece of the enterprise, right? So leading the five business group and the international piece. So that's around growth, and we need more growth, so that will be his focus. And then H.C. Shin was appointed Vice Chair, and he's taking on all the efficiencies, so everything going in relative to manufacturing and supply chain. And also R&D was put, and strategic planning was put under his plate. And as I said earlier, now succession planning started first day in office, right? So as a CEO you have to look upon it from the first day you walk into office. That's your obligation, and I have done that. And we have many very strong leaders in the company, Mike and H.C. are two of them, and they both have had tremendous successful record relative to leading businesses. H.C., the last six years led international, replaced me in that role before I became CEO. And before that, he in fact led the Industrial business group. Mike Roman has led the Industrial business group the last three years, before that was the Strategic Planner for the company, have lived both in Europe and Asia and have had good results. So we have two very solid individuals that have a job to do here. And so that's the whole point I would like to make with any comments around it.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, good morning.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Morning. Just a question on the EPS bridge. So in Q2 you had about $0.08 of tailwind from organic growth and productivity. In the first quarter that was about $0.22. And the price-volume dynamics, despite the questions so far, aren't grotesquely different in Q2 from Q1. So I wondered if there was something else going on that had weighed on the operating leverage in Q2? Maybe the timing of the business transformation or something like that? And how you thought about that $0.08 tailwind in Q2 in the context of what we should see in Q3 and Q4?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. Julian, if I think about the different quarters, as you're talking about Q1, Q2, we did see core underlying margin expansion once we strip out the gains in the strategic investments in Q1. And in Q2, we're more or less flat. So that's mathematically much of what's describing what you're seeing there on that EPS differential between Q1 and Q2. As we dissect that a little deeper, Julian, where did we not see some of the margin expansion we had seen in the past, and what does that mean for the second half of the year? Our Industrial business is one of those businesses where we didn't see as much leverage as we have seen in the past. And as we look to the second half of the year, we're expecting for the total year that we're going to be seeing 50 basis points at a minimum, possibly higher, of year-on-year margin expansion, stripping out the gain and strategic investment impact, so if we get to the underlying 50 basis points or slightly higher. Some of the reasons that will drive added leverage in a business such as Industrial, we do see that improved pricing that I talked about earlier. We do see improved results from our productivity programs, and probably some added belt-tightening going on.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Understood. Thank you. And then just my second and last question would be around the growth outlook in the EMEA region. I think a lot of companies this earnings have talked about a disconnect of the good soft data not necessarily translating into hard orders or sales. Should we think about your first half overall organic growth in the region of 1%? That is a good placeholder of what you expect for the second half? And maybe just any update on how you're seeing business in Europe in recent months?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. I think, when we look upon the rest of the year, I think you can see slightly more growth than you have seen in the first half of the year. So we look maybe for 2% in the second part of the year. I would say the comment relative to West Europe specifically is more around, I think Germany is still doing well. And if you look upon our figures and the way we do business over there, if you take manufacturing PMI in Germany, the second quarter was 59%, if you compare that to like 50% and 51%, 52% for China. So Germany, by definition, which is the big engine in Europe are doing well on the manufacturing side. And our business in Europe, if you look upon the portfolio, our Industrial business is very strong. So from that perspective, it's okay if you look ahead. We have not seen much of an impact to us relative to Brexit. I think countries like Spain are improving, but very much based on a lower base and some trouble they've had in the past. So when I look upon it, I would say Germany is doing well, which is a key element for you to be successful in Europe, and Nordic is doing fine, and you start to see some uptick maybe from countries like Spain. France goes sideways as we speak, but with the outcome of the election, I think that will be more positive if they can execute what they have promised, and why not? So, I think, as an outcome for Europe, generally speaking, is more positive than negative in my view. Relative to 3M, we have been on this optimization of the organization for quite some time, and if you joined, or for those of you that joined in Neuss, Germany here, a little more than a month ago, our whole execution of the EPS and SAP system is going very, very well. And I was \u2013 last week, I visited both center of expertise that we have. We have one service center in Poland and we have one supply chain center in Switzerland. I visited both of them and things are going very, very well for us in that execution. So for me, Europe generally speaking, externally, look more positive than negative. And I'm not talking only here the next two quarters. I'm talking a little bit further out, and our structure in place in Europe start to really gain momentum and deliver for us. This quarter was a little bit tough on top line but, generally speaking, I'm pleased with the progress we have made and that will pay off as we move ahead.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thank you.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. And good morning, everyone.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Joe.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Hi, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So, Nick, I want to kind of circle back to some of the comments you made earlier on the strategic investments, and just doing some of the back of the envelope math here, it seems like you're going to put forth about $400 million towards strategic investments this year, call it roughly $100 next year, and then we'll see in 2019. And then the payback in 2020 on an annualized basis is $125 million to $175 million. I'm just wondering like what is it about the investments that you're making? It just seems like it's taking a while for the payback to actually be seen in your margins. And so maybe if you can just provide some color on that? That would be helpful.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. Joe, thanks for asking that question. There's different types of actions a company like us, like 3M can take. Sometimes an action where we enter into a restructuring where we're reducing the size of our workforce, that can be a much faster payback. And you've seen actions like that that we've done and see very fast payback. When it comes to optimizing our manufacturing and supply chain footprint, those paybacks take time to materialize. We don't start seeing benefits, Joe, until we actually have the manufacturing site closed that we've chosen to action, and have the new manufacturing going on in a new location. That takes time to happen. It takes time to work with work councils, with employee organizations, it takes time to, in some places re-qualify that product if we're moving. It can many times be several quarters before we \u2013 from the point we announce it until we've actually physically made the change and start realizing those benefits. So this is different, and this is why this one takes longer to get happen. Still a very important part of our strategy though to be by 2020 getting to those savings that we're projecting.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Nick, that's helpful color. I guess, just a clarifying question on that, so this year you have gains that are essentially offsetting all of the investments that you're making. Next year there's going to be additional investments that you're making. Is the right way to think about 2018 that there's going to be a net negative to your margin from these investments? Or are there going to be other offsetting items as well in 2018?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Well, I can't speculate on whether there will be more M&A activity that will happen because those we announce once we have clear line of sight that they'll actually happen. But in terms of the footprint side, we'll still be seeing the negative impact in absolute terms in 2018 on our margin and on our EPS. We expect in 2019 to become positive, and then by 2020 to be the full amount. As far as the M&A and what that might do in 2018, I think it's too early for me to speculate on that piece.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Fair enough. And maybe just talking about the growth investments that you're making, and just to make sure that I understand that well, so you mentioned about $100 million in growth investments this year. And so if I just kind of think about just the payback from those investments, you mentioned it was about a point of growth, so call it like $300 million or so in revenue, at your operating margin 25%, say, if you're talking about, call it, roughly $75 million in profit. The question, I guess, is regarding these growth investments, do you think that going forward this is going to be part of the status quo or you're going to have to continue to make these investments? Or are these investments going to drive like a longer cycle product growth across your portfolio?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Well, first of all, it's $104 million additional investment for commercialization this year. And we said it will drive 50 basis point to 100 basis point of growth. And six, seven months into the year, we see that coming exactly as we laid out. I think, it's important to think about it. This is products and categories where we already have a very good position in the marketplace. So this is more, sell more of the same, but penetrate different parts of the world. So this is not relative to total new products or anything, this is category of products into markets where we already have a very good return and a good position in some parts of the world, but not everywhere. So we selected those programs in August of last year in order to make those investments. So with success, I think they will get more investment as they go, but it will be part of the normal business model. So this was an acceleration for us and an additional push. And I would say pretty safe product lines for us to penetrate more and broader, and deeper around the world.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks, Inge.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLaurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Good morning, guys. Just a quick one. You flagged certain markets where in organic local currency terms you've been in decline on filtration, roofing granules, office supplies, European health care, European energy, European consumer. If you look at that cluster of businesses, I think I might have missed one or two, if you look at that cluster of businesses, do you see a line of sight to getting that cluster back to a growth track next year? Or do you need a change in the macro environment to get there?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Well, I think, generally speaking, you will have from time to time some businesses that are not growing as fast as the rest of them. I think, the important thing for us is to make sure that all businesses can capitalize and use our four fundamental strengths in order to be strong. So the four fundamental strengths we have talked about is our technology platforms, our manufacturing capabilities, our geographic reach, and our brand equity. If you follow those categories, you will grow over time, and you will perform very, very well. And there's none of the businesses you listed there that I would say will fall out of that frame specifically. So I'm not overly concerned relative to any of them that you talked about specifically. And I would say, all of us leading businesses, we would like all businesses to grow every quarter, the whole time, right? But that is not reality. So I would say, our competitive position based on the four fundamentals of the company is very strong, and we should be able to outperform the local market wherever we compete. And as you know, we have talked about 1.5 times IPI, industrial production index, as a target that we have done in the past. And I think we should do closer to 1.7. So I'm optimistic relative to the future.\nLaurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Thank you.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Andrew.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: If I could just summarize \u2013 it's been a bit of a frustrating call \u2013 but just to summarize, your predecessor focused on driving top line, and there was this view that top line comes at the expense of margin that if you get growth you're not going to get margin. And this quarter I think seems to bring back those fears. On top of that of course you have the Amazon fear. If you look forward, do you think your new strategy for expanding some key products means that margin is now capped for a while as we're pursuing this growth strategy? Or do you think 3M still has levers to drive margin up both near-term and long-term?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Andrew, no fear. Don't be overly concerned relative to that strategy. And I think you have to think about it in a way that a certain element at a certain time you need to do with the business. And I think what we have done, we have worked very hard on the portfolio in order to make sure that we stay in businesses where we can use our four fundamental strengths. And if there's some businesses that have been underperforming, in every single case have been \u2013 the reason have been that they have not been able to use the four fundamental strengths. I think that's the basis for it. We have also said that by shifting and moving in the portfolio, our performance will be much better over time. And I think we have proven that in Electronics and Energy. I think we have proven that in Safety and Graphics. I think we have proven that in Consumer, if I go back to the 2012 starting point. And in Health Care we didn't need to do much because that portfolio was very strong by definition with high margins. Now we are focusing more in on the Industrial, and we are taking action there. And one \u2013 that's one-third of the company, so we need to get Industrial up and growing at a faster rate. And we have now had three good quarters of growth as we speak. And we are now taking action and more focus as we move forward relative to productivity, organizational structure, et cetera. So for me, it's not a question of one quarter, it's a question of how will it look as we go forward. I'm totally confident with all the work we have done, the way we have worked on the portfolio, the way we are improving the way we go to market, that we will continue to lever very well and deliver good result as we move forward. If not, I wouldn't execute the plan at all.\nAndrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. That's a great answer. And just a question in terms of what would it take to get high-end of your guidance on top line in terms of key regions and businesses, if you could outline the bull case scenario?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah, we upgraded the range from 3% to 5%, as you saw, right? And I think to be in the middle of that is very doable. We have 4% growth in the first part of the year. I think, we're not talking about businesses, but I would say from a geographical perspective, if we can capitalize more on our strengths in the United States, even more on that will help us. And I think the same for West Europe. So I think, it's \u2013 the United States, where we are \u2013 we are doing fine, but I think we are so strong here that we should be able to take even more of the opportunities in the United States. And as I said earlier, West Europe looks slightly better in my mind than I thought maybe two, three quarters ago. Let's see if that can come through during the rest of the year. If that's happened, then maybe can push us up to the higher end. But let's see? So let's hold for the \u2013 let's hold the range for 3% to 5% for now, and then we can talk next quarter to see how it look like if we can give you some more color to it. But 3% to 5% is very, very realistic for us. And as I said earlier, I'm very pleased with where we are after two quarters in terms of the result. 4% growth after two quarter is respectable for us I think and pretty good.\nAndrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And just to reiterate, because I am getting these e-mails, you outlined a margin growth strategy in Europe, you're sort of positive on margin opportunity in Safety and Graphics. None of that has changed?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: No. Nothing of that has changed.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: No, nothing has changed on that front.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: No, no, no. Not at all.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Absolutely not.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Not at all.\nAndrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for some closing comments.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. As I said earlier, I'm pleased with the performance through the first six months of the year. We are successfully executing the 3M playbook and positioned to deliver a strong 2017. As you saw today in our updated guidance, this includes good progress relative to our four primary financial objectives: earnings per share, organic local currency sales growth, return on invested capital, and free cash flow conversion. At the same time, we are making investments to accelerate growth and strengthen our portfolio, which will build on an even more competitive 3M for 2018 and beyond. Thank you very much for joining us, and have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference call for today.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Tuesday, April 25, 2017. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland - 3M Co.: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2017 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO, and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for this year's investor events. Please turn to slide 2. First, starting with earnings, our Q2 and Q3 conference calls will be held on July 25 and October 24 respectively. Next, our 2018 outlook meeting will take place on December 12. Please mark your calendars. On slide 3 are details for our upcoming European investor meeting, which will be held on June 6 and 7 at our headquarters in Neuss, Germany. We will be posting the presentation materials on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com for those that are not able to attend the meeting in person. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide 4. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to slide 5, and I'll hand the call off to Inge.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The 3M team delivered a strong start to 2017. We posted good growth that was positive across all geographic areas while expanding our profitability. At the same time, we increased investments across the enterprise to accelerate organic growth and improve productivity. I will take you through the first quarter highlights. Companywide, organic local currency sales growth was 5%. Growth was led by Electronics & Energy, which grew 12% in the quarter. We have done a lot of work in this business to improve our relevance to customers and the marketplace, and those efforts are paying off. Industrial, our largest business group, had another good quarter with 6% growth, as did Safety & Graphics, which grew 5%. Health Care grew 3% organically, and we continue to expect growth in this business to accelerate further into the year. Our Consumer business declined 1% due to ongoing channel adjustments, specifically in the office and retail space. Companywide, we posted total sales of $7.7 billion along with earnings of $2.16 per share, up 5% year over year. Operating margins were 23%, which includes $136 million of strategic investments we made in the first quarter. Excluding those investments, our core operating margins were nearly 25%, so we are executing extremely well. We also returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This includes a 6% increase in the dividend, which marks 3M's 59th consecutive year of increases. And over the last five years, we have doubled our per share dividend. Beyond financial results, we continue to execute our three key levers, which are big value creators both today and into the future. The first if portfolio management. And in March, we announced the acquisition of Scott Safety for $2 billion. This will further strengthen our position on the fast-growing personal safety market. The second lever is investing in innovation, and in Q1 we invested $470 million in research and development, or 6.1% of sales. This includes adding more resources in the field to bring our scientists and application engineers even closer to our customers. These investments support organic growth along with our ability to constantly deliver premium margins. We also continue to move forward with a third lever, business transformation, which starts and ends with our customers. It is making it easier for our customers to do business with us while creating an even more ideal and efficient 3M. The backbone of business transformation is our new ERP system, and the rollout in West Europe is nearly complete. You will hear more about this at our Investor Day in Germany on June 7. Please turn to slide 6. In addition to the three key levers, we took also other actions to prepare our enterprise for success in both the short and long term. Earlier, I mentioned the incremental $136 million of strategic investments we made in the first quarter, which include $36 million to accelerate growth in the core platforms. These growth investments will continue throughout the year, and we expect them to contribute 50 to 100 basis points of growth in 2017, which we began to see in Q1. We also took actions to strengthen the portfolio and optimize our manufacturing footprint. These actions will increase productivity and intensify our focus on larger, faster growing opportunities in the future. In summary, the first quarter was strong for 3M. We delivered good financial results while investing for the long term. I will now turn the call over to Nick, who will take you through the details. Nick?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Thanks, Inge, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 7 with a recap of our first quarter sales performance. As Inge mentioned, we posted strong organic growth in the quarter of 4.6%, with volumes up 4.5% and selling prices up 0.1%. Divestitures of non-strategic businesses reduced sales by 0.4 percentage points, and foreign currency translation decreased sales by another 50 basis points. As a result, total first quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 3.7% versus last year. As you can see on the right side of the slide, growth was broad-based across all geographic areas. Let me start with the U.S., where organic growth was 1.4%, led by mid-single-digit increases in both Industrial and Safety & Graphics. Our Electronics & Energy and Health Care businesses also delivered solid growth in the quarter. The Consumer business declined mid-single digits organically in Q1, impacted by channel adjustments in the office market, as Inge mentioned. Asia-Pacific led the company with organic growth of 10.1%. All business groups posted strong growth in the quarter, led by a double-digit increase in Electronics & Energy. We also had strong growth in Industrial, Health Care, and Consumer. Looking at key countries within Asia-Pacific, organic growth increased 13% in both China/Hong Kong and Japan. Excluding our Electronics businesses, China/Hong Kong grew 12%, and Japan was up 2%. Moving to EMEA, organic growth increased 4% in Q1. West Europe was up 5% organically, with sales growth led by Industrial and Safety & Graphics. Central/East Europe and Middle East/Africa grew nearly 2%. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada increased 2.3%, led by a high single-digit growth in Health Care, along with solid growth in Consumer and Safety & Graphics. At a country level, Mexico continued to deliver strong growth, at 8%. Canada was up 3%, while Brazil declined 3%. Please turn to slide 8 for the first quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide, first quarter sales were $7.7 billion, and net income increased 3.7% to $1.3 billion. GAAP operating margins were 23.1%, down 100 basis points versus last year's Q1. Earlier, you heard Inge mention the additional $136 million of strategic investments we made in Q1 to strengthen 3M for the future, in terms of both growth and productivity. Excluding the impact of these investments, margins were up 80 basis points year over year, driven by strong organic growth and solid operational performance. Let's take a closer look at the various components of our margin performance in the first quarter. Organic growth, along with improved productivity, contributed 120 basis points to margins. Lower raw material costs, net of selling price changes, added another 50 basis points. Raw material prices remained favorable to start the year, as our global businesses again delivered savings in excess of market price changes. We expect raw material benefits to moderate as the year progresses, but still remain positive for the full year. Turning to headwinds, foreign currency, net of hedge gains, brought margins down 40 basis points in the quarter. As previously discussed, strategic investments impacted margins by 180 basis points, and higher pension and OPEB expense decreased margins by 30 basis points year on year. Finally, lower year-on-year gains from divestitures reduced margins by an additional 20 basis points. Let's now turn to slide 9 for a closer look at earnings per share. First quarter GAAP earnings increased 5.4%, to $2.16 per share. The combination of organic growth and productivity contributed $0.22 per share to Q1 earnings. Business transformation is having a positive impact on our productivity efforts. The year-on-year impact from divestitures reduced earnings by $0.03 per share. Foreign currency, net of hedging, reduced pre-tax earnings by $0.04 a share, while strategic investments were a $0.16 impact. The first quarter tax rate was 23.7%, versus 26.8% in the comparable quarter, which increased earnings by $0.09 per share. The lower year-on-year tax rate was driven by favorable geographic profit mix, increased tax benefits from employee equity-based compensation, and ongoing strategic tax initiatives. In light of the first quarter performance, we now expect our 2017 full-year tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27.5%. Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined nearly 2% year on year, which added $0.03 to Q1 earnings per share. Please turn to slide 10 for a look at cash flow. We continue to generate solid operating cash flow as a company, which allows us to consistently invest in the business and also return cash back to shareholders. First quarter free cash flow was $701 million, down $245 million year on year, largely due to the timing of pension contributions. Full-year 2017 pension contributions are expected to remain in the range of $300 million to $500 million, similar to 2016. Free cash flow conversion was 53%, and for the full year, we continue to anticipate free cash flow conversion to be in the range of 95% to 105%. Recall that Q1 is typically our lowest conversion rate of the year. First quarter capital expenditures were $287 million, in line with our expectations heading into the quarter. For the full year, we continue to anticipate CapEx investments in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. As you heard earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 6%, resulting in $702 million in cash dividends paid to shareholders during the quarter. We also returned $690 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases. We continue to expect full-year repurchases in the range of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion. Let's now review our performance by business group, staring with Industrial on slide 11. Industrial continued its strong growth momentum from Q4, delivering first quarter sales of $2.7 billion, up 5.7% organically. Industrial's growth was broad-based, across all businesses and geographic areas. Our automotive OEM business continued to lead sales growth within Industrial, increasing double digits organically. Growth in this business outpaced the rate of global car and light truck builds by more than 400 basis points. Advanced materials also had a strong start to the year, up high single digits. Our Heartland businesses within Industrial, abrasives, industrial adhesives and tapes, and automotive aftermarket, each increased mid-single digits organically. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by Asia-Pacific, up high single digits, while the U.S. and EMEA increased mid-single digits. Industrial delivered first quarter operating income of $625 million, with operating margins of 23.1%. Operating margins were down 80 basis points year on year, or up 40 basis points adjusting for a Q1 2016 divestiture gain. As you can see, Industrial is off to a strong start to 2017. For the full year, we now expect organic growth in the range of 2% to 5% versus our prior estimate of 1% to 3%. Please turn to slide 12. First quarter sales in Safety & Graphics were up 4.8% organically to $1.5 billion. Personal safety, another Heartland business, delivered strong organic growth in the high single digits, with particular strength in Asia-Pacific and the U.S. The roofing granules business continued to perform well in the first quarter, posting double-digit organic growth, as demand remained strong in the replacement shingle market. Geographically, Safety & Graphics grew organically in all areas, led by mid-single-digit increases in EMEA, Asia-Pacific, and the U.S. Operating income for the business group was $399 million, and operating margins increased 180 basis points to 26.1%. Adjusting for acquisition and divestiture activity in this year and last, operating margins were up 80 basis points. As with Industrial, Safety & Graphics is off to a strong start, and growth is better than we anticipated entering the year. We now expect organic growth for this business to be between 2% and 5% versus a prior estimate of 1% to 3%. Please turn to slide 13. Our Health Care business generated first quarter sales of $1.4 billion. Organic growth was 3.1% year on year, in line with our full-year expectations of 3% to 5%. Growth was led by a double-digit increase in both drug delivery systems and food safety. Our medical consumables businesses, which represent the largest segment within Health Care, posted good growth in Q1. Oral care delivered mid-single-digit organic growth in the first quarter, a marked improvement from the second half of 2016. Our health information systems business was down low single digits organically. We expect the business to improve throughout the year. Geographically, organic growth in Health Care was positive in all areas, led by high single-digit growth in Latin America/Canada and Asia-Pacific. We saw notable strength in China/Hong Kong, which was up double digits in the quarter. Health Care's operating income was $434 million, and margins remained strong at 30.5%. Importantly, we generated these returns while investing an additional $21 million to enhance growth in core platforms across the business. Please turn to slide 14. Electronics & Energy led our company with organic growth of 11.5% in the first quarter. Sales were $1.2 billion. The Electronics side of the business grew 18% organically, as our team successfully drove increased penetration on a number of OEM platforms. Demand strengthened across most market segments in consumer electronics, which also boosted our growth rate, and we benefited from favorable year-on-year comps. Our Energy-related businesses were up 1% organically, with low single-digit growth in electrical markets, while telecom was flat. On a geographic basis, organic growth was up double digits in Asia-Pacific, where our Electronics business is concentrated. First quarter operating income for Electronics & Energy was $225 million, with margins of 18.6%, up 70 basis points. Adjusting for first quarter portfolio actions, margins were nearly 24%, up 600 basis points year on year. As you can see, Q1 organic growth was very robust for Electronics & Energy. As a result, we are updating our full-year growth expectations for this business to a range of up 1% to 6% versus a prior range of down 3% to up 1%. The first half of the year is expected to be stronger than the second half, largely driven by year-on-year comps. Please turn to slide 15. First quarter sales in Consumer were $1 billion, and organic growth declined 1.2% year on year. Three of our four businesses within Consumer grew organically, again led by home improvement followed by consumer health care and home care. Within the home improvement business, our Command damage-free mounting products posted strong double-digit growth, as accelerated investments continue to pay off. Filtrete filters also delivered strong growth in the quarter. More than offsetting this growth was a year-on-year decline in our stationery and office supplies business, which was impacted by continued channel inventory reductions, primarily in the U.S. office retail and wholesale. Geographically, organic growth in Consumer was led by Asia-Pacific and Latin America/Canada, which was more than offset by a decline in the U.S. Operating income was $222 million, with operating margins of 21.3%. Looking at the full year, we expect organic growth for Consumer to be in the range of 1% to 3% versus a prior estimate of 2% to 4%. We also expect to see growth improve as the year progresses. Please turn to slide 16. Before I turn it back to Inge, let me address a few items that we anticipate will happen over the remainder of 2017. The net impact of these items is factored into our EPS guidance today. First, as you may recall, in December we announced the divestiture of our Identity Management business within Safety & Graphics. The sale of this business, which has annual sales of approximately $205 million, is expected to close during the second quarter. Upon completion, we expect to record a gain on sale of approximately $0.55 per share, partially offset by the profit that will go with the business in 2017 after the divestiture is closed. In addition, recall at our Investor Meeting in March 2016, we introduced a plan to better optimize our portfolio and supply chain footprint. We expect to make significant progress on that plan in 2017, with associated costs in the range of $0.40 to $0.45 per share over the remainder of the year. We anticipate $0.20 to $0.30 per share will incur in Q2. In total, the net impact of these items is expected to add between $0.05 and $0.10 to 2017 earnings per share. Again, this impacted is reflected in our full-year updated guidance, which Inge will now cover on slide 17. Inge?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you, Nick. As you have seen, our team delivered a very strong start to the year. As a result, today we are raising our full-year expectations for both organic growth and earnings per share. We now anticipate organic growth in 2017 of 2% to 5% versus a prior range of 1% to 3%. With respect to earnings per share, we expect earnings of $8.70 to $9.05, up 7% to 11% versus a prior range of $8.45 to $8.80. Finally, we continue to expect strong performance in terms of both return on invested capital and free cash flow conversion in 2017. With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, guys.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Andy.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Good morning, Andy.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Can you talk about the uptick in strategic investments that you're making a little more? You said that you were going to do $0.05 to $0.10 of investments in 2017, but you did $0.16 in the quarter. A lot of that seems to be in E&E and Health Care. You mentioned the increased growth, where you expect the 50 to 100 basis points. How much did you see in the first quarter? And can you classify these moves as a lot more offensive to gain share, or maybe more defensive, in E&E especially, given that you've had some share impact from OLED for instance? So how do you characterize it all?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Andy, thanks for the question. You covered quite a few things there. Just from an overall theme standpoint, Andy, we're always looking for opportunities to enhance the value of the enterprise, and that's really part of our business model. What you see in the first quarter for incremental investments, some of that was investments we were taking to accelerate growth. And that was really lined up with what we had shared last December of the incremental $100 million over the course of 2017 to deliver accelerated growth throughout the year. The other context I'd share with you in thinking about this step up in strategic investments, if you think back to last March at our investor meeting when we laid out our five-year plan, we shared plans for optimizing our portfolio and supply chain footprint with at that time what we described a total of between $500 million and $600 million of investments, and ultimately that we expected that by 2020 to be creating $125 million to $175 million of annualized benefit, operating income benefit. What you're seeing in this step up of accelerated strategic investments both for the quarter and for the year is us taking more action related to what we laid out last year for the optimized actions on our supply chain footprint.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it, okay. That's helpful, Nick. And then shifting gears, your guidance of 2% to 5% expected growth in Industrial, you did 5.7% in the first quarter. Comparisons do get a little harder, especially in 4Q, we know that. But your Industrial business also seems to have momentum entering the second quarter. So what do you think could slow down as the year goes on? How much of the new guidance is conservatism versus concerns around things like auto OE? Or is anything else in the investor portfolio slowing? Or is this just it's early in the year and you've seen a nice uptick in the businesses and you do expect momentum here as you go into 2Q?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Hi. Good morning, Andrew. This is Inge. What I think you should look, first of all, we see good momentum globally for the Industrial business, and you can see that also then going over to our Safety & Graphics business. So both of them are doing slightly better than we thought when we started the year. And you can see, we changed the range not only for the company but for those two businesses specifically, from 1% to 3% to 2% to 5%. It is early in the year, so we don't see at this point in time anything specifically that will slow. But I think a range of 2% to 5% is more realistic at this point in time. And when you look upon Industrial, there was in the United States very good growth for us, and the same in West Europe. And I just came back from China two weeks ago, and you can see a slight momentum upwards there as well. So we are raising it now to 2% to 5%, and we will maybe, of course, talk more about it as we have maybe one more, two more quarters under our belts here.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, Inge. Appreciate it, guys.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nJoseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Joe.\nJoseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So maybe staying on the growth point for a second, so clearly really strong organic growth quarter. I'm just curious. As the quarter progressed, did the things \u2013 did momentum continue to get better? Was there any particular month that was better than others? I'm just trying to understand, I guess, really in the context of the full-year guidance.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah, Joe, as the quarter went on, it was consistent strength across the quarter, all three months of the quarter. And I'd further add, we're seeing April, the start of April, tracking very much in line with what we've been seeing for the first quarter, so really no intra-quarter trend changes to note.\nJoseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then I guess, maybe taking two of those businesses and talking for a second about Electronics, which had a great quarter at plus 11% and change, and the guidance for the rest of the year, and the expectation for what you expect will be the shift to OLED over the next couple quarters, and then contrasting that maybe with the Consumer business, which has been a really stable business for you guys for quite some time, and whether you think that there are maybe some structural versus cyclical pressures that you're seeing there.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Well, first of all, if we start with Electronics & Energy, as I said earlier, we have done a lot of work in that business during the last couple of years, in order to make sure that we have the right structure in place. And I think those are the things that you see, in terms of action we are making on the portfolio, some right-sizing on manufacturing, et cetera. But what also had been going on for quite some time is our shifting of commercialization capabilities into faster-growing businesses in Electronics & Energy. And we will continue, of course, to look upon consumer electronics, utilities, construction, and semiconductor. But over time here, for the last couple of years, we have shifted more into data center, to automotive electrification, to energy grid, and communication infrastructure. So that's a move over time, and that starts to pay off. And your comment on OLED, there is no change to what we laid out earlier in the year. But one thing that you need to understand with our \u2013 we are global. So what we see in what you call consumer electronics, we are going on big platforms for the Chinese OEMs as we speak. So I think we have a tendency to over-rely on the United States enterprises, in terms of that platform. And as I said, came back from China two weeks ago, and the progress we are making on platforms out there on consumer electronics is just fantastic. So I will say, on that business, the things that you see in terms of actions, but there's also things that we have done, in terms of shifting our focus into faster-growing businesses. And I think we showed that at the last investor meeting, where we talked of (33:50) moving more capabilities into $12 billion market opportunity that is growing 10% to 15%. So that's the piece you see. So I'm very, very pleased, I would say, with the hard work that business had done in order to manage the cost and efficiency, and then type of shift to faster growing markets. In terms of Consumer, Consumer had basically, this quarter, three or four division was growing. One division was down, and it's basically into United States, and it's into the office channels. When we look upon that now, for the second quarter in a row, our sale-out is 2%, but our sale-in is down. So I think it would take us a couple of more quarters in order for the inventory levels to come right in that channel. It's not a 3M issue. It's maybe an issue relative to consolidation in that channel that is pretty robust, I will say, if you follow what is going on into that channel. And when we looked upon the growth for Consumer around the world, we had robust growth everywhere except in Central/East Europe, Middle/East Africa, we were down 2%. And then, as Nick said, in the United States we were down 5%, all into the office supply. But if you look upon the rest, it was very good growth. We had China/Hong Kong 40%, Canada 5%, Latin America 2%, and total international was actually 4% growth. So let's see how long time it will take for the channel to adjust. I cannot predict that as I sit here, but probably another two quarters or so.\nJoseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you for the color.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities: Hi, thank you.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities: Good morning. I just wanted to start with the pricing side. I think core price in your EBIT margin bridge was flat in the first quarter. It was down slightly in the fourth quarter. How are you thinking about price overall for the balance of the year, versus that figure in Q1? And I noticed your U.S. pricing, at least in your revenue commentary, is still negative. Do you think that will turn up in the balance of the year?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yes, Julian, we're not fundamentally seeing any change in our pricing power. That remains strong. We do continue to look for targeted places where we can use price to help drive organic volume growth. If I look out over total 2017, we're expecting U.S. price growth to be approximately flat. If I expand it to the total globe, if I pull out the FX impact, we expect pricing to be up slightly. Our normal range is 30 to 50 basis points of core price growth. I think it will be somewhere between there and flat for total 2017.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities: Thank you very much. And then my second question was just around the strategic investments. I was just trying to square some of the different numbers. Is the sense that the higher operating leverage you're getting from the better organic growth, you're redeploying most of that into growth-related strategic investments, and then the majority of the gain you're getting you're redeploying into cost or COGS-related reduction efforts? Is that a fair summary, or is there something going on in the end markets that's also driving some of this stepped-up spending?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yes, of the $136 million in strategic investments in the first quarter, Julian, a little less than half of that is investments that we see having a fairly short-term return in 2017 and into early 2018. And those are primarily growth-oriented investments, and those growth-oriented investments were factored into the guidance we set out for the year. The remainder of the strategic investments, those relate to our portfolio, supply chain footprint. And that's really laid out aligned closely with the plan that we put forward a year ago in March.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities: Understood. So in your initial EPS bridge from December, the $0.05 to $0.10 of strategic investment headwind, that correlates fairly closely with that $0.40 to $0.45 portfolio and footprint actions you called out in today's slide 16?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: No, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities: Not entirely, but it's a different line is it?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yes, so in December when we laid out our guidance, EPS guidance for the year, strategic investments we had incrementally in a $0.05 to $0.10 range. That was aligned primarily \u2013 or almost exclusively with our growth investments. Now what you're seeing, we're seeing the growth investments play out exactly as we guided, still in that $0.05 to $0.10 range for the total year. What we're layering on top of that is additional footprint actions and portfolio actions that we're taking throughout 2017. So on top of the growth investments, there's roughly an incremental $0.10 of supply chain and portfolio actions that we took in the first quarter of 2017. And then in terms of the guidance for the balance of this year, for Q2, Q3, and Q4, there's an extra $0.40 to $0.45 on top of that that was not part of our initial guidance. So all in, the growth investments, the incremental $0.10 that we took in the first quarter plus what we're expecting Q2 through Q4, it's now in the range of $0.55 to $0.65 for the total year.\nJulian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities: That's really helpful. Thanks, Nick.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, good morning.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Nigel.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: At the risk of \u2013 yes, good morning, guys. At the risk of flogging that dead horse to death, so the timing of the accelerated investments in 1Q, is it because you saw you had a tax benefit and then therefore you decided to offset that? Does that explain the timing of the investments? And should we think of this as more of a pull forward from \u2013 you mentioned the $0.05 to $0.10 of growth investments. It sounds like all that's been made in 1Q, so this is a pull forward, Nick?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Nigel, we're always, as I said earlier, we're always looking for opportunities. The level that we were investing in Q1 in strategic investments around growth, no pull forward there. That's coming exactly as we had planned. The increased strategic investments around portfolio actions and the supply chain footprint, that's aligned with our longer-term vision. The exact timing of when we were going to do that we did not have clarity on until we started pulling the trigger on some of those actions in the first quarter and some that we expect to have happen over the next three quarters. So I'm not sure I'd characterize it as a pull forward as much as it would be now is the time that it looked like the right time for us to pull the trigger on actions that we had laid out last March.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then the revised guidance, does this bake in anything for Scott Safety, or is that still outside of the guidance? And I'm wondering if maybe the $0.40 to $0.45 of actions maybe includes the $0.10 of dilution from Scott.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: No, the $0.40 to $0.45 does not include anything for Scott Safety. At the time that closes, we will update guidance to take into account any impact that will have on our 2017 earnings.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, and then just one quick one. Some companies have talked about the benefit from channel restock. I'm just wondering. What sort of intel do you have on sell-in versus sell-outs? Did you see any restocking? It looks like our checks (43:10) might have been, but any color there would be helpful.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yes, first of all, you heard Inge talked about some of the channel impacts in our office retail and wholesale channel. In addition, in our Industrial channel, we are seeing increased confidence in the channel, which we're seeing good sell-out of our product. We're seeing even stronger sell-in to the industrial channel, primarily in the U.S. So that is one place where we're attributing it to higher confidence amongst that channel and seeing what appears to be some restocking of depleted channel levels that we've seen in the past.\nNigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Deane.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, I was hoping to circle back on Consumer and the stationery office commentary. This came up in the fourth quarter. And, Inge, you gave us some good color in terms of the sale-in and sale-out as the destocking going on. We can see and read about all the consolidation in this channel, but I was interested in hearing your commentary about e-commerce because that is a growing factor in these products. And how was this captured in your channel descriptions and categories? Are you calling the brick-and-mortar customers a part of your channel overall? Does that include their e-commerce? And so how does e-commerce factor into this?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yes, it does. So e-commerce is one channel of many for us. And if you think about the total enterprise, in a quarter like this, our e-channel sales is north of $200 million, and we are growing 6% in that channel generally as a total company. International actually grew 25% in e-business for the quarter. So it is an element. And so for us, we look upon our customers in terms of one channel. Then inside of them, they have omni-channel, et cetera, which they are utilizing. And as you have seen, when you \u2013 I cannot talk about them. We have to look upon their reports. But as you see, for many of them, the \"e\" part is growing very, very fast, and it's type of slower growth in the traditional business, if you like. And that's the same for us then when we look upon our \u2013 as our output in terms of growth. But as I said, for that channel, generally speaking it is the United States at this point in time that are consolidating as a total channel. The e-channel is growing I think for most of our customers, and we are part of that.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: That's real helpful. And then just over on Health Care and oral care specifically, one of your key competitors was seeing destocking in this business on the consumables side. It looked like you didn't suffer from that. Is it easier comps? Have you seen the destocking trend over? And maybe you can comment on the sell-in versus sell-through.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: We did not see what you're describing here. We saw maybe a little bit more confidence actually into the channel on our products. So we took market share on the consumable part into the oral care, and I think there's momentum there. So we had 5% growth, and I think the momentum and the confidence with the retailers is very high for our products as you move forward into the year. So I think it's a combination of us taking market share and also the retailer, as Nick said, for Industrial specifically, we have good confidence as we move into the year and maybe build a little bit of inventory, but it's not the majority of the growth.\nDeane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: That's helpful, thank you.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: A couple loose ends here. First just on Electronics, you actually raised the range, particularly a wider range with one quarter in your pocket already. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit on what the big swing factors are as you think about how the rest of the year plays out for you specifically.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: First of all, I think the positive is that we changed the guidance north. We extended the range a little bit, and that's based on, I would say, very positive outlook that we have as we move in on some of the platforms, specifically out in Asia. And as I said earlier, we have worked for quite some time relative to our commercialization capabilities into market segments that are growing faster. And I talked about data center. I talked about automotive electrification and energy grids and communication infrastructure. That is starting to pay off. So I will say that it looked positive, but it's still early. But as you see, we go rather 1% to 6% than 1% to 5%. This may be indicating the positive signs that we see in that business in terms of growth. And of course, margins have improved dramatically the last couple of years. And as you see again, this quarter we took some actions that we could do and still deliver very, very good margins for that business.\nJeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Are there some specific OEM wins that really drive how this plays out that you don't have visibility on yet, or is it just an end market demand question?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: No, there are also wins, and that will of course especially now and the sales will come later. But as I said earlier, I think we have a tendency to think about 3M as a U.S. company. We are a global company. So we work on platforms all over the world. And as you know, out in Asia there are very big movements coming from the Chinese OEMs relative to this space. And they're all spec'ing in our products as they move ahead.\nJeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: And then just a couple quick cleanups for Nick, if I could. Nick, on tax, have you solved your 2017 tax rate down to what you think your ongoing sustainable tax rate is going to be, or do we have more downside as we look forward? And also just on the $136 million of spend, where was it precisely? I think $21 million in Health Care and maybe it was $70 million to $75 million in E&E. Is that right? Where was the rest of it? Thank you.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Jeff, to your first question on the tax rate for what we're now seeing for total 2017, there are a few dynamics going on. First of all, we are seeing a favorable geographic profit mix for us that is helping us in our tax rate. It's been a headwind for us the last couple years, and that's switching over to a tailwind for us this year. We're also seeing some of the benefits, as you'd expect, from some of our tax planning. But one of the more significant items just in the first quarter is the benefit we're getting from the accounting standard change that came into effect last year for the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. From a year-on-year basis, that's about a $0.04 benefit versus what we had a year ago. And, Jeff, I'd say that's the wildcard. Other things are going very much as we had planned, to get to the 27% tax rate by 2020. But with the added variability from what happens with this excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation, there will be some quarters that's a benefit, and some quarters we won't see any benefit at all. All in, we're well on track for hitting the 27% in 2020, possibly even lower than that. But when we have better clarity on that, we'll give a revised number of, can that go even lower than the 27%. To the second point on the strategic investments, the $136 million, of the growth-related investments, you're correct. Health Care had the majority of that. There were small amounts, single digits of millions of dollars, low to mid-single digits in millions of dollars, in the other four business groups. And then, from a portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization, the vast majority of that is impacting the Electronics & Energy business, with a little of that hitting the consumer and office business, the Consumer business group.\nJeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob McCarthy with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Can you hear me?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yes.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yes.\nRobert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. So this is more of a longer-term question. Obviously, listen, you're a global company, you've been making investments with the perspective of a multi-year view, which is obviously wise and prudent, but you are dealing with geopolitical headwinds, across-the-border volatility. How do you think about the investments you've made, particularly in global excellence, particularly in the Eurozone? If we see an increased risk of a breakup there, is there actions you're going to have to take? How are you going to react to some of these black swans with respect to perhaps increased nationalism?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: First of all, as you know, we have done business in international for many, many years, so we have a good understanding of the ins and outs relative to different parts of the world. And I will say that the way that 3M emerged and developed itself over years have been country by country, and starting with a sales office, then becoming a subsidiary, adding in technical capabilities and then manufacturing, et cetera. And I think, the last 10 years or so, we have start more to regionalize and be more efficient, specifically around supply chain and manufacturing, where we still have continued to execute commercially in every country because, as you know, this is \u2013 in most cases, different languages and in some cases, different currency. I don't think there will be much of a change as we move forward, to be honest, and if so, we have to adjust to that. So I think we have had experiences in the past where we need to change the business model geographically, based on what is happening in that specific area from time to time. And we can go back as early 1990s where the European Union was formed, and the way we changed the structure at that point in time, in order to serve the European market with free goods flowing, people able to move in-between countries, and there will be one currency for all countries in Europe. Now, that didn't really play out the way that that was laid out and that was figured out, not last year, not two years ago. That was figured out 10 years ago. And we adjusted again to that, and have been successful ever since in those geographical areas. So, it's difficult to talk about specifics here today, because we don't know what will happen, but I can guarantee you one thing, that we are diverse enough in our management, and we have experience enough, both in United States and overseas, in order to adjust our business model at any point in time in order to serve our customers.\nRobert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Just as a follow-up to that, I think one thing about the ERP investment, the global excellence investments, is ultimately looking at SKU rationalization around the company. But if you have this countercyclical trend of increased nationalism and perhaps higher trade barriers and less regionalization, doesn't that cap the upside from SKU rationalization?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Not necessarily. I think that the business transformation we put in place will serve us very well for the future, despite what will happen in terms of things in Asia and Europe, et cetera. I think we will see \u2013 people are rational relative to growth. So people will understand and see that fewer distribution centers are better because, by definition, you can serve the customers in a more efficient way, to a lower cost. So reality is, when everything is \u2013 all cards is putting down in place, people understand that is the most effective way to do business, and it will enhance growth of the economies around the world and Europe specifically, as you talk about it.\nRobert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Just a last follow-up. Has there been any change in your outlook, in terms of CapEx or investment, with respect to automation in your facilities for the last 18 to 24 months?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Rob, as far as the automation portion of our CapEx spending, a year ago at our investor meeting, we laid out that we expected that to be a noticeable part of our CapEx investments. What we're seeing is, that's playing out exactly as we laid out a year ago, that we're seeing continued opportunities for automation investments within our CapEx plans. And I wouldn't call it an uptick, but I'd say it's playing out exactly as we laid out.\nRobert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your time.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nScott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Scott.\nScott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Inge, I can't remember a time where we had 5% core growth in Western Europe, and I'm trying to figure out whether this is just a weak euro and most of that is just export markets. Or is it really broad-based, both internal consumption plus export, given your experience in running Europe for so many years? Maybe you can give us a little bit of color around what you see in Europe, and what you think the outlook is for the rest of the year more specifically?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: So first of all, it was broad-based, where we saw \u2013 if you first talk about business groups, all business groups, except one, had growth of \u2013 we had one that grew 5%, which was Industrial, so you have 5% in Industrial for the whole of West Europe. You have 6% for Safety & Graphics. You take those two businesses together, which is into the industrial sector very much, we'll say, you looked upon 5% to 6% there, and it was broad-based. Electronic was up to 7%, and then it was slow in Health Care and Consumer. In fact, Consumer, that is a very small business for us in Europe, was actually flat. So you look upon that, it was broad-based, with growth of I will say 4% to 6% in the most important business for us. There was no big change on the country side, but you can see countries that have been slow in the past like Spain \u2013 it will now be called Iberia \u2013 are coming up, but that's very much due to comparison for them. But I will say there's positive momentum, driven very much out from Germany, I will say, and that's broad-based and it's of course starting in Industrial and Safety & Graphics. So it was very good and it was not one-time shot as I see it.\nScott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, so there's some sustainability to it?\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yes.\nScott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So I know there's been a half dozen questions on this, but I'm not sure I got the answer or the answer was clear. If core growth positively surprises \u2013 I think you're being reasonably conservative the rest of the year. Will your growth investments need to accelerate from these levels, or are these new levels that you've stated the new line in the sand for 2017?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Scott, the increase in the strategic investments from what we originally guided is really around supply chain and portfolio optimization and much less around growth. If we see growth even higher than what we're currently expecting, could our growth investments tick up some? I think the short answer is yes. It could tick up some, but I don't think on a material basis. I think we're now talking single digits of pennies at that point.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: As you remember, Scott, we laid out for the year, actually I think it was $100 million to $105 million in those investments that we call core surge, core platforms. And $36 million was there the first quarter, and we started already last year to load into those opportunities. And we see the result coming, so that's the positive thing. So the growth coming this quarter, I will say that there's been a lot of work there that is in my view both the microscope and a telescope. The microscope is to make the investment and get growth going. And then you saw some of that investment we did in strategic investment is a type of a telescope. This will create very good value for 3M and for the shareholders as we go ahead. So if you think about what we did here this quarter, I think if you look upon it as a playbook, this is right what you would like to do in order to build both short term that most of us are focused on, but also for the mid to long term for shareholders for 3M. So I think it was the right thing to do.\nScott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, good color. Thank you, guys, and good luck.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, guys. Good morning.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Steve.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Good morning, Steve.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Can you just remind us what exactly when you talk about supply chain rationalization, what exactly that is? Is this just a fancy way to talk about restructuring? Or just remind us in I guess the most brief way, since we're coming to the end of the call, what exactly some of those actions are.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Steve, thanks for the question. Part of what we talked about a little over a year ago at our outlook meeting, for the five-year outlook meeting, is the number of manufacturing sites we have around the world and looking at the productivity in those sites and the opportunity we have through rationalizing the number of those sites, increasing capital into some of our more productive sites, the opportunity to reduce the total footprint of our manufacturing and supply chain sites over the course of the next four years. So that's what we mean when we talk about it when we laid out a $500 million to $600 million investment that we expect to take, the resulting productivity from that, that by the time we get to 2020 we think that will add another $125 million to $175 million of added operating income through that productivity we can get through rationalizing our supply chain footprint.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right, okay. That makes a ton of sense, and one last question just on price/cost. Outside of Electronics, was there anywhere where price was negative? I know it was 0.1% or whatever, so there probably \u2013 maybe outside of Electronics it wasn't. I'm not sure. Just maybe a little bit of color on where, if there is any, there was price pressure outside of Electronics.\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: If I look at this globally, Steve, we had positive though very small price in all businesses except for Health Care, where we were flat.\nCharles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies and Company. Please proceed with your question.\nLaurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Good morning, guys, just two very quick ones. First on the restructuring costs in Q2, any segments in particular where margins would be noticeably distorted? And secondly, as you think about the cadence from 2017 to 2018, do you now think your growth investments and restructuring costs will be flat year over year, or do you think they'll be a bit of a tailwind into 2018?\nNicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Laurence, to the first question on business, and I'll go further in geography, we expect that this action that we're taking in the second quarter and in the third and fourth quarter will impact all businesses and all geographies, that it will be broad. As far as the specific details of each business, we're still working through those details. We're not ready to be sharing that yet, Laurence. And then as far as 2017 to 2018, some of these actions will have a tail into 2018, where there will be residual cost impacts hitting us in 2018, though I expect it will not \u2013 I very much expect it will be a decline from the level that we're projecting now for 2017.\nLaurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Thank you.\nOperator: That does conclude the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over Inge Thulin for some closing comments.\nInge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. To wrap up, this was a very strong quarter for 3M in terms of healthy broad-based growth, increased earnings per share, and good execution across each of our business groups and functions. Equally important, we made additional investment to support growth and productivity for the remainder of 2017 and well into the future. Thank you for joining us this morning and have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a great day, everyone."}], "2019": [{"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 4, "year": 2018, "date": "2019-01-29 13:22:16", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by.

At that time, if you have a question, please press the one followed by the four on your telephone keypad. It is recommended that you use a landline phone if you\u2019re going to register for a question. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, January 29, 2019. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M. \nBruce Jermeland: Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2018 business review. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Nick will make some formal comments and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Please note that today\u2019s earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading, Quarterly Earnings. Please turn to Slide 2. Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our 2019 quarterly earnings conference calls, which will be held on April 25, July 25, and October 24.  Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1a of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Finally, please note that throughout today\u2019s presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation and press release. Please turn to Slide 4, and I\u2019ll hand it off to Mike. Mike?\nMichael Roman: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I will open with a brief summary of our fourth quarter and later in the call, I will come back to discuss our full-year performance along with our outlook for 2019. 3M executed well in the fourth quarter with results that were in line with our expectations. We delivered organic growth across all business groups and geographic areas, along with a double-digit increase in both cash flow and adjusted earnings. Looking at the numbers, total sales in the quarter were $7.9 billion. We posted organic growth of 3%, which is on top of 6% growth in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Growth was led by our healthcare business group, which grew 5% organically, along with electronics and energy, which grew 4%.  With respect to EPS, our team delivered adjusted earnings of $2.31 per share, up 10% year over year. This includes a $0.02 net benefit from a divestiture which Nick will cover in more detail. The strength of our value model is enabling us to consistently generate premium margins and healthy cash flow. Margins in the quarter were more than 22% with all of our business groups above 21%. Cash flow increased by 23% year-over-year with a conversion rate of 128%. Finally, in the fourth quarter we returned $2.1 billion to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. That concludes my opening comments. I will now turn the call over to Nick, who will take us through the details of the quarter. Nick?\nNicholas Gangestad: Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 5.  Organic sales growth in the fourth quarter was 3% with volumes up 160 basis points and selling prices up 140 basis points. The communication markets divestiture reduced sales by 1.3 percentage points while foreign currency translation was an additional 2.3 percentage point headwind to sales. All in, fourth quarter sales in U.S. dollars declined 60 basis points versus last year. Geographically, the U.S. grew 4.4% organically with broad-based growth across all business groups. Latin America-Canada was up 5% organically with broad-based growth across Canada, Mexico, and Brazil. Asia Pacific grew organically 2% in Q4, led by double-digit increase in healthcare and mid-single-digit growth in electronics and energy. Organic growth was up 1% in China-Hong Kong versus 18% a year ago. China-Hong Kong organic growth was led by healthcare and electronics and energy, while safety and graphics and consumer declined. Finally, organic growth was up 1.3% in EMEA with West Europe flat. EMEA was led by mid-single-digit growth in both healthcare and safety and graphics, while consumer and electronics and energy declined. Please turn to Slide 6 for the fourth quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide, fourth quarter sales were $7.9 billion with operating income of $1.8 billion and operating margins of 22.4%. On the right-hand side of this slide, you can see the components of our margin performance in the fourth quarter. Organic volume, productivity, and lower year-on-year portfolio and footprint actions added 100 basis points to margins. Lower year-on-year divestiture gains, net of actions reduced margins by 130 basis points. Higher selling prices continued to more than offset raw material inflation, contributing 20 basis points to fourth quarter margins. Finally, foreign currency net of hedging impacts increased margins by an additional 10 basis points.  Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 7 for a closer look at earnings per share. Fourth quarter GAAP earnings were $2.27 per share. Please note that this result included a couple items that were not included in our guidance. First, during the quarter we recorded a net $0.04 tax charge. This charge relates to the transition tax and the deductibility of our Q1 2018 legal settlement associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Secondly, we completed the final piece of the communication markets divestiture, resulting in a net $0.02 earnings benefit. Taking into account these items, fourth quarter underlying earnings were $2.29 per share. As you see, a number of factors impacted fourth quarter earnings. The benefits of organic growth, productivity, and lower year-on-year portfolio and footprint actions added a combined $0.18 to per-share earnings in the quarter. Lower year-on-year divestiture gains net of related actions reduced fourth quarter earnings by $0.13 per share versus last year. Foreign currency, net of hedging was an additional $0.03 per share earnings headwind in the quarter. Other expense contributed $0.06 to earnings year-on-year as higher Q4 2018 retirement expense and underlying net interest expense was more than offset by last year\u2019s fourth quarter repurchase of high coupon debt. Our underlying tax rate was lower year-on-year, which added $0.05 to Q4 earnings; and finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined by over 3% versus Q4 last year, adding an additional $0.08 to per-share earnings. Please turn to Slide 8 for a look at our cash flow performance. Fourth quarter free cash flow was $1.7 billion, up 23% year-on-year with a free cash flow conversion rate of 128%. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $531 million with the full year totaling $1.6 billion. Also during the fourth quarter, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders via dividends and gross share repurchases. Let\u2019s now review our business group performance starting with industrial on Slide 9. The industrial business delivered organic growth of 2.5% in Q4 and 3.2% for the year, with growth across all geographic areas for the quarter and full year. Growth was led by advanced materials, up double digits followed by low-single-digit growth in industrial adhesives and tapes, separation and purification, abrasives, and automotive aftermarket. Our automotive OEM business was down 1% year-on-year versus a 5% decline in fourth quarter global car and light truck builds. For both the quarter and the full year, our auto OEM business outperformed global car and light truck builds by 400 basis points, continuing our long track record of outperformance. On a geographic basis, industrial\u2019s organic growth was led by a 4% increase in the U.S. while the other three geographic areas each grew low single digits. Industrial delivered fourth quarter operating income of $627 million with an operating margin of 21.2%. Underlying margins were up 40 basis points year-on-year adjusting for last year\u2019s portfolio and footprint actions. Please turn to Slide 10. Fourth quarter safety and graphic sales grew 3.3% organically versus an 11% comparison a year ago. For the full year, safety and graphics was up 5.1%. Growth was led by our personal safety business up 7% organically. Scott Safety continues to do well with strong double-digit growth in Q4. Commercial solutions grew low single digits while transportation safety declined mid-single digits. Finally, our roofing granules business declined low teens as shingle manufacturers continued with lower production volumes in the quarter. Geographically, organic growth was led by a 7% increase in Latin America-Canada, followed by the U.S. and EMEA which were each up 5%.  Operating income in the fourth quarter was $345 million with operating margins of 22%. Underlying margins were down 110 basis points year-on-year due to the sales decline in roofing granules along with some additional fourth quarter actions. Please turn to Slide 11. Our healthcare business generated fourth quarter sales of $1.5 billion, up 4.8% organically. In Q4, our medical solutions business posted mid-single digit organic growth with particular strength in vascular access and procurement solutions. Oral care grew 4% in the quarter with positive growth in both the U.S. and international. Our 3M Clarity clear tray aligners launch continues to build momentum. Fourth quarter organic growth was led by a high single-digit increase in food safety followed by mid-single digit growth in health information systems.  On a geographic basis, healthcare grew across all areas with continued strength in developing markets, led by China-Hong Kong up 18% in the quarter. Healthcare\u2019s fourth quarter operating income was $458 million with margins of 30.2%. We continue to focus on investing in our priority growth platforms in advanced wound care, population health, and custom orthodontics. Next, let\u2019s cover electronics and energy on Slide 12. Electronics and energy finished the year with solid fourth quarter organic sales growth of 4.1%. The electronics side of the business delivered fourth quarter organic of 3% with similar growth in both electronic materials and display solutions. On the energy side of the business, sales were up 5% organically with strong growth in both grid modernization and renewable energy. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by a 7% increase in Latin America-Canada, while both the U.S. and Asia Pacific were up mid-single digits. Fourth quarter operating income for electronics and energy was $396 million with operating margins of 29.5%.  Please turn to Slide 13. Fourth quarter sales in consumer were $1.2 billion with organic growth of 1.9% year-on-year. Growth was led by our home improvement business up mid-single digits and stationary and office was up low single digits, while home care and consumer healthcare declined. Looking at consumer geographically, organic growth was led by a 6% increase in Latin America-Canada with the U.S. up 5%. EMEA declined 7% as we continue to adjust our product portfolio in this region. Lastly, Asia Pacific declined 5% as we continue to experience lower year-on-year demand for our consumer respiratory solutions, particularly in China-Hong Kong due to improved air quality. Finally, fourth quarter operating income was $257 million with operating margins of 21.3%.  That wraps up our review of fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 14, and I\u2019ll hand it back over to Mike. Mike?\nMichael Roman: Thank you, Nick. The fourth quarter capped an important year for 3M as we posted good results and continued to transform for the future. We delivered organic growth of more than 3% with growth across all business groups and geographic areas. We expanded GAAP earnings per share by more than 12% to $8.89, or $9.96 on an underlying basis. We posted free cash flow conversion of 91% along with a return on invested capital of more than 22%.  In 2018, we also delivered record sales of $33 billion while returning significant cash to our shareholders. All in, we returned $8.1 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases, and last year was our 60th consecutive year of dividend increases.  Please turn to Slide 15. Beyond financial results, in 2018 we continued to position 3M for long term growth and value creation. This includes executing our four priorities, which I laid out at our investor day in November. I\u2019ll comment briefly on the impact of each priority, starting with portfolio.  The ongoing review and reshaping of our portfolio is critical to maximizing value for our customers and shareholders. In 2018 for example, we sold our communication markets business. This builds on the portfolio work we\u2019ve done over the last several years in electronics and energy which has led to improved growth and margins. Last month, we also announced the acquisition of MModal\u2019s technology business, which is a leading provider of AI-powered healthcare solutions. As you recall, two years ago we decided to retain and further invest in our health information systems business. This acquisition builds on that commitment and will expand our ability to improve outcomes for both patients and providers. We expect this transaction to close in the first quarter and its impact is reflected in our updated guidance for 2019, which I\u2019ll cover shortly. Turning now to transformation, which is fundamentally improving how we serve our customers, how we work and how we compete, 2018 was an important year in our transformation journey. Our team executed our ERP deployment across all five business groups in the United States, which accounts for nearly 40% of our global sales. This was a significant undertaking. I commend our people for successfully rolling out our new systems and I thank our customers for working closely with us through this change. With the U.S. rollout, we have deployed approximately 70% of our global revenue on the new ERP system. We are now stepping up our efforts to fully leverage this progress and accelerate value realization for our customers and our company. Ultimately, transformation is making 3M a more agile, more efficient and more competitive enterprise.  Our next priority is innovation. Innovation is fundamental to our organic growth and is key to our long track record of delivering premium margins and return on invested capital. It allows us to create unique, differentiated solutions for our customers, which leads to superior returns for our shareholders. In 2018, we continued to invest in both research and development and capex, with accelerated investments in our priority growth platforms focused around healthcare, transportation, safety and infrastructure. Technology is advancing rapidly in these market spaces, and 3M will continue to capitalize on these opportunities as we move ahead. This brings me to people and culture, which is foundational to each of the other priorities. Everything that differentiates 3M - our technologies, our manufacturing, our global reach, our brand - starts with our people. In 2018, we expanded development opportunities for 3Mers while launching initiatives to deepen our commitment to sustainability, diversity and inclusion. We also earned a number of external recognitions, including being named one of the world\u2019s most ethical companies for the fifth straight year. In summary, our team made good progress on each of our priorities in 2018 and we are positioned for a successful 2019. Please turn to Slide 16. As you recall, at our investor day in November we laid out our guidance framework for 2019. Since then, there has been slowing in key end markets with the biggest impact coming from China, automotive and electronics; therefore, we are widening our range for expected organic growth to 1 to 4% against the prior range of 2 to 4%. We now anticipate EPS of $10.45 to $10.90, which includes a $0.10 earnings headwind from the MModal acquisition, against a previous range of $10.60 to $11.05. Please note that the prior range did not include the MModal impact. We continue to expect a return on invested capital of 22 to 25% along with a free cash flow conversion rate of 95 to 105%.  Please turn to Slide 17. Here you see a breakdown of our expectations for organic growth, starting with our business groups. We expect organic growth to be led by healthcare with a range of 3 to 5%, followed by safety and graphics at 2 to 5%. Organic growth in industrial is expected in the range of 1 to 4% with electronics and energy at zero to 4% and consumer at 1 to 3%.  Looking by geographic area, we expect organic growth in the United States of 2 to 4% followed by EMEA at 1 to 3%. Organic growth in Asia Pacific is expected in the range of 1 to 5% with Latin America-Canada at 3 to 5%.  I\u2019ll now turn it back to Nick, who will provide some color on our 2019 outlook. Nick?\nNicholas Gangestad: Thanks Mike. Please turn to Slide 18. Here are our key planning assumptions in 2019. Most of our key assumptions remain unchanged from what we discussed at our November investor day, with the exception of three items. First is the expanded full-year organic growth range that Mike just discussed. Second is in regards to our global pension expense. December\u2019s market volatility lowered our 2019 earnings benefit versus our expectation in November. Lastly, we are now including the estimated full-year growth and earnings impact from the pending MModal acquisition. Other items to note, we are forecasting full-year foreign currency translation to be a 1% headwind to sales but neutral to earnings. Turning to raw materials, we do anticipate higher year-on-year costs, including tariff impacts; however, we continue to expect our selling prices along with our global sourcing team\u2019s ongoing productivity efforts to more than offset the expected raw material headwinds. We estimate the 2019 impact from the pending MModal acquisition net of the communication markets divestiture to be neutral to sales and an earnings headwind of $0.15 per share. We continue to increase our efforts to accelerate benefits from transformation, portfolio and footprint optimization, along with our manufacturing and SG&A productivity. Lastly, we forecast our full-year tax rate to be 20 to 22% versus our 2018 underlying rate of 20%.  I\u2019ll now move to our 2019 capital allocation plan on Slide 19. Our strong operational cash flow fuels our capital allocation plan. We expect another year of strong cash flow from operations with 2019 estimated to be between $9.5 billion and $10.5 billion prior to our investments in R&D and our global pension plans. All in, including cash, marketable securities, and added leverage, our 2019 plan calls for $14.5 billion to $16.5 billion of available capital. Our first priority for capital deployment remains investing in our business, which includes research and development and capex supplemented with acquisitions, while at the same time returning cash to shareholders.  Please turn to Slide 20. Here you can see our 2019 earnings road map based on the key assumptions I just laid out. For 2019, we expect per-share earnings in the range of $10.45 to $10.90, including a negative $0.10 impact from the MModal acquisition. This earnings range represents an increase of 5 to 9% year-on-year compared to our 2018 underlying EPS of $9.96.  To wrap up, fourth quarter was a good finish to 2018. We are focused on executing our four priorities along with delivering on our financial objectives in 2019.  With that, we thank you for your attention and will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Obin: Good morning. Just a question on Asia - you guys clearly seem to have a better handle on your customers than a lot of other folks, but as we think about 2019, do you have a sense when Asia growth bottoms ex-whatever contingency you have on the tariff negotiations? How should we think about the pace of growth in Asia throughout 2019?\nMichael Roman: Andrew, if you look at the guidance we have for Asia in our outlook, we see it pretty balanced across the year within those ranges and within that range of guidance. Now, the caution as we start the year is really focused on not so much trade and tariff, but on the impact in end markets that we talked about - automotive and electronics are the focus for the slower, more cautious view as we look to 2019. So, I think as we get a better view of what\u2019s going to go on in those end markets, that would change where we are in the range, but I think that balance across the year is the way I\u2019d have you think about it.\nAndrew Obin: Just a follow-up question. A couple of people asked us about R&D spend. Your longer term framework, 6% for the year, I think in \u201918 it was 5.6 for the quarter, 5.5. Any timing on R&D in 2018 and how should we think about R&D in 2019?\nMichael Roman: This is--as you said, Andrew, this is still a priority and we\u2019re committed to this. It\u2019s what drives our differentiation, our innovation in 3M, and if you look at where we are in the quarter, we saw some impact from the contract R&D work that we do for customers and I would say the divestiture of the communication markets, so those are a few of the things that kept us a little lower in the quarter. We are committed to driving that model, that 6% R&D and the investment in capex that goes along with it. If you look at 2018, we actually did have an increase in headcount, so it\u2019s a better reflection maybe of our commitment to that ongoing investment.\nAndrew Obin: Terrific, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks, good morning guys. Maybe just following up on Andrew\u2019s question on China, and more specifically auto and electronics, you took the guide down by a point at the low end, not really surprising given what we\u2019re seeing across the value chain. I guess the question though, is, it seems like those end markets were generally okay for the quarter. How did things progress during the quarter, and what are you actually seeing in your core business that makes you feel like growth will be slower in those end markets for 2019?\nMichael Roman: Joe, we talked about this a bit at the third quarter call that we saw some slowing in China as we went into Q4, and automotive was one of the things that we talked about. That said, we saw additional slowing as we exited the quarter, and you see it in the projection for build rates, the updated view of the build rates in the quarter and then the projection for where things are going in 2019, there\u2019s just caution. There\u2019s a revision down. It\u2019s not a huge step down, but it\u2019s a revision down in the first half of the year really driven by China, so I would say some additional slowing in the outlook for build rates in automotive. Electronics - you know, it held up well in the quarter, we had a good solid finish for that business. In fact, if you look at 2018, we were right in the range for what we were expecting in the electronics markets, and we had a cautious outlook as we went through the year. I think you see it with the OEMs in that market, they\u2019re signalling a cautious view, and it\u2019s more for first quarter than it was necessarily impacting Q4 of \u201918.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, fair enough, Mike. If I could follow up, Nick, just on price cost. You\u2019ve seen commodities come in a little bit as we ended the year, saw the raw mat headwind on the bridge, but maybe just talk a little bit about how much price do you think you\u2019ll be able to get in 2019, and are the pricing actions already in place for those benefits?\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes Joe, I would say much of 2018, as well as Q4, has played out exactly how we expected, that we expected fairly significant raw material headwinds that we\u2019ve been more than offsetting throughout the year with our selling price increases, so as I look backwards on \u201918, very much how we saw that happening.  As we look forward into 2019, we do see raw material and tariff headwinds continuing, just not at the same level of what we saw in 2018, so you see in our earnings bridge, we\u2019re expecting $0.10 to $0.20 of headwinds, and that\u2019s inclusive of tariffs. In November, when you were with us, I laid out that I expected that to be about $100 million headwind from tariffs. Right now, we put that at about $70 million year-on-year headwind from tariffs, and that\u2019s built into that $0.10 and $0.20, and we remain optimistic that selling prices will more than offset. The last part of that question, the vast majority of our price increases have already been enacted, either late in the second half of 2018 or ones that have already been announced that go into effect early this year, so much of it, if not all of it has already been actioned.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Good morning, guys. Nick, can you talk about what happened in safety and graphics in terms of the 22% margin you report in the quarter? You mentioned some fourth quarter actions and weakness in roofing granules impacting margin, but margin was obviously lower than last year\u2019s Q4 despite now lapping Scott Safety, so how much of the fourth quarter actions were unusual and would you expect margin going forward to be up significantly in \u201919 versus \u201918?\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes Andy, one of the first things you should do is just look at--we had a noticeable gain in fourth quarter last year on the sale of our electronic monitoring business within safety and graphics. That\u2019s why we\u2019re explaining that the underlying margin, once we pull that gain out, is down 110 basis points. The two primary things driving that 110 basis point margin contraction, one is that decline in roofing granules, and then we\u2019ve also--as you know, we\u2019ve acquired the Scott Safety business. We continue to take actions to integrate that. We\u2019ve been taking a number of actions, and that continued integration of Scott Safety is the second contributing factor to the margin contraction. Overall, we\u2019re extremely pleased with Scott Safety\u2019s performance, high growth in the quarter, and very pleased with the contribution it\u2019s making to our safety and graphics business.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Okay, and then maybe shifting gears to healthcare, 4% growth in oral care is the best you\u2019ve recorded in some time there, and China growth is obviously strong in healthcare. Do easier comps in drug delivery mean that the lumpiness really that we saw in \u201918 is probably behind 3M and that the confidence level in your 3 to 5% organic growth in healthcare for \u201919 is reasonably high?\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes Andy, I think it\u2019s still going to be lumpy in 2019, and that\u2019s primarily going to be driven by comps to what we saw in 2018. For the full year, we\u2019re not anticipating that drug delivery in total is going to have a noticeable impact on healthcare\u2019s growth, but as I look at the seasonality of what we\u2019re staring into of comps in drug delivery, we will see it being negative in the first half of the year and likely positive in the second half of the year. \nMichael Roman: Andy, let me clarify - negative comps from drug delivery. We\u2019re not seeing the healthcare business negative in the first half. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Right, but overall the rest of the business does seem reasonably solid, and you would say you have pretty good visibility into the rest of the business, including the new product intros that you\u2019ve got in oral care starting to impact that business?\nMichael Roman: Correct, yes.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: All right, thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning. Maybe a quick one on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of channel inventory levels and if we\u2019re all still normal, or if you\u2019re seeing anything different across any of your businesses.\nMichael Roman: John, I would say we came out of Q4 pretty balanced across the businesses in channel. It\u2019s something we watch very closely - you know, we\u2019re watching sell-in, sell-out, and it looks to be pretty balanced. I would say with a word of caution around the end markets that are slowing - that always puts a focus on channel, so when you look at what\u2019s going on automotive and electronics, we\u2019re watching that closely and making sure that we have a good view of what\u2019s going on there. But as we exited \u201918, it looked to be a pretty good balance, and that\u2019s not just true of those specific end markets but across broader industrial and even across the consumer business as well.\nJohn Walsh: Got you. Maybe just drilling down into one of those specifically, because every once in a while it kind of does get called out, is on the automotive repair and refinish. Obviously there was some channel consolidation there - that all seems to be behind the business, I just wanted to kind of confirm that.\nMichael Roman: Yes, I think what I said about the broader industrial is true for automotive aftermarket as we come out of \u201918 as well - pretty balanced across the channel. That said, what we called out there, the consolidation, that\u2019s something that is ongoing. We saw a significant impact as we went through the first part of the year. I think that\u2019s something that can continue, so that\u2019s another one of those impacts on channel inventory that we watch as we see consolidation. But coming out of the year, pretty balanced in automotive aftermarket as well.\nJohn Walsh: Got you. Maybe one more specific to the businesses here. With the acquisitions you\u2019re done, personal safety now by sub-business is one of your larger exposures. Obviously I think you said organic was up 7. Can you just kind of talk a little bit about what\u2019s happening there and if you think that kind of momentum can continue to carry on?\nMichael Roman: If you think about personal safety, it\u2019s been a leader for us in growth over the last two years - \u201917 and \u201918, both strong growth, and that\u2019s really, I think, a testament to the organic priorities that we put there and the leading position that we\u2019ve been able to develop organically, and then also the acquisitions that have complemented that portfolio well. It positions us well in the marketplace where the growth is happening, and so we continue to see leading growth for the company and we have a very strong portfolio and position for our customers. I expect--you know, it\u2019s a larger business and it\u2019s a very strong contributor to our growth as we move ahead, so I expect it to continue to lead in its market.\nJohn Walsh: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to follow up if there was any extra color you\u2019d give on how the year is starting out in Q1 versus either sales ranges laid out on Slide 17 or else the earnings bridge items on Slide 20 - things like FX, hedging . I\u2019m not sure how that plays out through the year. On the revenue side in particular, just wondering how confident you are in Q1 that APAC and the EMEA regions can both see positive growth. \nNicholas Gangestad: Julian, so far what we\u2019re seeing as a start to this year is very much in line with the guidance that we\u2019ve laid out. Just in terms of how we ended 2018, I\u2019d say as we went through the quarter, things were very much in line with what we were expecting. The only color I\u2019d put is we probably saw some weakening in China as the quarter went on. Now in terms of 2019 and our guidance and what we\u2019re expecting there, things that can impact quarter by quarter, foreign exchange, and I\u2019ll talk this on an EPS basis, we think that\u2019s going to be neutral for the year given where the currencies are, if they stay there, and given our hedging position. I will note that it will be a headwind in the first half of the year, particularly in Q1, and then a tailwind to us in the second half of 2019.  Other things to note, we expect margin expansion throughout the year, full year. Based on our guidance, it pencils out to about 100 basis point margin expansion, and tax rate, the tax rates we expect by quarter, we\u2019re guiding 20 to 22%. I\u2019d expect to see the first quarter closer to the low end of that range and then the other quarters closer to the midpoint or high end of that range.  Then as far as growth that you were asking about, right now our view is we see pretty much all the areas lining up with the ranges that we\u2019ve laid out. I think in the case of China and Asia, where we\u2019re guiding low to mid single digits, if anything I\u2019d expect the first quarter to be the more challenged of those and then progressively better, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much out of the range that we\u2019ve just laid out here, quarter by quarter.\nJulian Mitchell: Thank you, Nick. My follow-up question would just be around some of the various cost levers in the P&L. You\u2019d stated that operating margins should be up about 100 basis points for 2019 overall. I\u2019m guessing R&D may be a slight headwind, R&D to sales coming up, so how do we think about the delta on gross margin versus SG&A? I ask particularly because you had very, very good SG&A control in the second half of the year in particular. Is that a one-time but then needs to step back up in SG&A to sales in \u201919, or is it a function of productivity and business mix changes so it\u2019s sustainable? \nNicholas Gangestad: Julian, if I break it into the three components you\u2019re asking about, we do see our R&D expense as a percent of revenue going up in 2019. We see our gross margin improving and we see our SG&A percent to revenue going down, so that margin expansion is going to be coming from both gross margin improvements and SG&A productivity. The gross margin improvements, some of that has been going from our transformation, some of it is coming from our footprint actions that we\u2019ve been actioning over the last couple of years, and then on the SG&A front it\u2019s our continued leverage of the productivity through our transformation efforts, that we\u2019ll be continuing to expand margin on that front. \nJulian Mitchell: Great, thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. \nScott Davis: Good morning, guys. A couple small questions here. First one, I\u2019m just curious, how do you get Scott Safety to grow 10%? I mean, Tyco tried for a long time and I don\u2019t think they ever had a quarter anywhere close to that type of growth. Is it as simple as just plugging into your distribution system, or is there something more to it?\nMichael Roman: Yes, I think Scott Safety, it goes back to what I was talking about with the safety business in general. When we\u2019re bringing together those complementary portfolios, it\u2019s been a really, I think, a win-win for us as we\u2019ve integrated the teams together, that we can go out with leading solutions and combine those, and that\u2019s having a noticeable impact. It\u2019s certainly energized the teams and it\u2019s had some impact on the business. I think we had a number of projects come together in Q4 - that was part of it as well, so we certainly saw positive timing impacting it, but we are seeing a lift from having our leading personal safety portfolio combining with Scott Safety and Capital Safety, for that matter, and bringing those into the marketplace together.\nScott Davis: That makes sense. As a follow-up, I\u2019m just curious on the cadence of cost-out on the ERP. When you deploy--when you get 70% done, how long before you can cut the cord on the duplicate spend? There\u2019s obviously some duplicate spend for a while until you are 100% comfortable going with that new ERP system. Is that a material change in cadence through the year of cost-out into 2020?\nNicholas Gangestad: Scott, I wouldn\u2019t call it a material change throughout the year. I\u2019d call it a continued progression of what we were seeing in \u201918 into \u201919, so there\u2019s not going to be one significant triggering event; but every quarter, additional productivity as we realize those benefits, as we ensure that our supply chain is functioning as we expected, as we\u2019re meeting our customers\u2019 requirements, as we continue to work through those things, we continue to see more and more SG&A opportunity for benefits, but not a cliff. It will just continue to evolve over the next couple years.\nMichael Roman: Scott, maybe to add to that, we have a value realization map, and as we deploy and we stabilize, we get benefits from that as we take better advantage of our service models that we put in place, we get benefit. But we\u2019re also--you know, we talked about this in the investor day, really doubling down on leveraging the new capabilities we have, and that gives you a steady opportunity to drive productivity. That\u2019s what I think you\u2019ll see, and that\u2019s the next point - it\u2019s going to be a steady progression as we take full advantage of the capabilities that we\u2019re putting in place.\nScott Davis: Fair enough. Good luck and thank you, fellows.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you, good morning everyone. A little chilly for you guys this morning, I see too. \nMichael Roman: A little bit.\nDeane Dray: Glad everyone made it in. For Nick, it looks like free cash flow - yes, you\u2019re above 100% for the fourth quarter, but it did lag your historical fourth quarter conversion pretty significantly. Can you just walk us through the puts and takes there, please?\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes, as part of what I\u2019ve shared before, we in 2018 built inventory in anticipation of some of our go-lives for our business transformation ERP deployments, and as we\u2019ve progressed throughout the year, one of the more significant things is that that extra inventory that we\u2019re seeing that\u2019s been impacting our cash flow. It\u2019s one of the things that we are starting to see change in the fourth quarter, and our expectation as we guide 95 to 105% free cash flow conversion in 2019, the expectation that we make even more significant improvements on that going through \u201919. So working capital is the biggest thing I\u2019ll call out there, that we see that it\u2019s one of our biggest places for opportunity in our free cash flow conversion. \nDeane Dray: Got it. Then one of the businesses that had a soft spot in the third quarter was office retail, but I see it swung into one of the growth areas this quarter. Could we just drill down for a bit on office retail, maybe address ecommerce and expectations in 2019?\nMichael Roman: Deane, this has been an evolving story and we\u2019ve talked a lot about the channel and the restructuring that\u2019s going on there. We see it as a sell-in, sell-out kind of story. Even through that transformation, we were seeing sell-out for our portfolio still being positive. We were seeing negative sell-in as we saw the restructuring of the channel and inventory coming out. Certainly ecommerce is another growth platform for that portfolio and we continue to do very well there in that category - it\u2019s a strong growth driver for that business, so as we came through \u201918, we started to see the balance between sell-out and sell-in come a little closer, so we saw some positive growth on the sell-in, and again the sell-out remaining still strong. So as we get into \u201919, the story will be what additional structure or changes will happen in the channel, how does that shift. We\u2019re going to continue to be focused on the end user and driving that demand and driving that sell-out, and I think we\u2019ll continue to drive positive growth from that over the long run.\nDeane Dray: Got it. Just a last quick question - your comment on the air quality improvement in China caught me a little bit by surprise, but I see news reports now real significant improvement, especially in Beijing. Is that going to be a recurring theme, because you\u2019ve got some tough comps in that business throughout that you\u2019ll be looking at in 2019.\nMichael Roman: Deane, we certainly had some tough comps as we came through the second half of \u201918, and with an improvement in air quality you saw that play out as part of the slowing that we saw in China in the second half of the year and impacted those businesses related to it as well. When we go into \u201919, we still see some comp in the first half of the year, but it gets a little more normalized and it will depend on what happens to air quality as we move ahead, does it continue to see an improvement. But the base for it gets more in line with what we saw in \u201918 as we go through \u201919.\nDeane Dray: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Tusa: Hi guys, good morning. Can we just help calibrate, perhaps with some numbers, what could happen here in the first quarter? I mean, I hear a lot of commentary from you guys and from everybody - obviously it\u2019s more of a macro thing, about things slowing towards the end of the quarter, and then into the first quarter you had a couple electronics guys who really saw a fall-off towards the end of the quarter and into the first, and you said it\u2019s not going to be too different but kind of sounding like it\u2019s toward the low end of the range year-over-year. I mean, are we talking about basically of a--will you grow organically in the first quarter at the low end of that range, is that what you\u2019re saying?\nNicholas Gangestad: Steve, I would not be surprised if in the first half of the year, partially based on comps, we\u2019re in the lower half of the range, and in the second half of the range we\u2019re in the upper half of the range. Much of what we have is lined up that way. I don\u2019t see us in negative growth territory in any quarter. The second quarter, the only reason I say that, Steve, is we noted in second quarter last year that we felt there was some pull ahead of revenue from third quarter into second quarter, so we\u2019ll be facing into that comp second quarter of this year.\nSteve Tusa: That makes a lot of sense. Your normal seasonality is up low double digit from 4Q to 1Q. Should we think about that as a little bit lower organic offset by lower tax, or is the organic enough to kind of make first quarter a bit less of a seasonal performance?\nNicholas Gangestad: I think taxes typically--our first quarter is typically our lowest tax expense. I do see it a bit more normalized of tax expense if you look quarter by quarter. If you look at 2018, our tax expense in the first quarter was noticeably below the range. I don\u2019t see that happening in first quarter of \u201919 - I think it will be in the range, but closer to the low end. Then the other piece, Steve, as I mentioned, FX will be a bit of an abnormal pattern throughout the year, that it will be a headwind to us in the first half, in particular in the first quarter, and then it will be offsetting and flipping, and that\u2019s primarily driven by hedging that we\u2019re seeing. We had hedging losses in 2018, and if currencies stay where they are, they\u2019ll be flipping to hedging gains in 2019.\nSteve Tusa: And how big are those gains for \u201919?\nNicholas Gangestad: We had hedging losses of approximately a little over $80 million in 2018, and if currencies stayed where they are, they\u2019d be in the $50 million, $60 million, $70 million of gains right now.\nSteve Tusa: One last quick one for you guys on portfolio management. This year, you\u2019re kind of flipping the portfolio around a little bit. It seems like it\u2019s a bit of a headwind, this kind of $0.15 headwind. I know some of it is temporary, but is that kind of--should we be ready for a bit of year one dilution as you work through--you know, as you continue to work through the portfolio on an annual basis, or does it all catch up towards the end because I know that you\u2019ve guided to positive, ultimately positive benefits over the long term, but obviously this year is a bit of a negative. How should we think about that in the context of the long term guide on portfolio management?\nNicholas Gangestad: If I use MModal as an example, that one we see as a $0.10 headwind this year that\u2019s driven by some of our transaction costs one time, some of our integration costs at the beginning of our time of owning it, as well as some ongoing amortization. This particular one, we guided that we think by year three it will be about 10 times--that this would equate to a 10 times EBITDA, so it will be generating $100 million-plus of EBITDA by year three. I\u2019d say that\u2019s not uncommon of what to expect, that often in the first year we want to aggressively integrate whatever we buy into the company to be fully realizing the value model that we can create by having it part of 3M.\nSteve Tusa: Okay, thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning guys. Maybe to start out, Nick, can you talk about what some of the offsetting factors are in guidance? I guess if I add up pension, MModal, and then the lower organic growth, it seems like a bit more than what you\u2019ve tweaked the range by. You mentioned that the tariff headwind was a little lower. Is there anything else in the bridge that we should be aware of as being an offsetting item?\nNicholas Gangestad: In terms of what we were anticipating back in November, those three things you just called out, Josh, those would all be tweaks down. As far as tweaks up since November, we\u2019re seeing a less negative environment for raw material prices, that if I had called out specifically back in November what we were expecting for raw material headwinds, I would have been quoting a higher number there, and that\u2019s partially offsetting some of these tweaks down that I\u2019ve laid out. That\u2019s the single biggest one that\u2019s changed.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Then just as an exporter, did you see any of your customers in the fourth quarter do any pre-buy work when January was still kind of a target date for tariffs? We\u2019ve seen some of that in some other short cycle guys, curious if that impacted you at all.\nMichael Roman: Josh, we watch that closely and it\u2019s part of what we look at in the channel - you know, when we see these macro changes, are they impacting the pre-buy. We didn\u2019t see that as we came through the quarter, and as Nick said, the quarter progressed the way we expected. It\u2019s not just watching from a distance - we\u2019re close with those partners, and we didn\u2019t have any indication of that happening, certainly not at any significant level.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it, appreciate it. Thanks Mike. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Inch: Good morning everybody. So Europe, Western Europe flat, how much of that was self-inflicted by your own actions to withdraw from certain product lines and markets versus the actual market, and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a way to quantify it, but how does that spill into the 2019 outlook as well? Is there a way to quantify that?\nNicholas Gangestad: John, I\u2019d estimate that there\u2019s about 200 basis points of us taking specific actions of adjusting our portfolio, of product lines that we\u2019re choosing to exit that are built into that. There will be some carry-forward of that into \u201919, but not on as a significant level as what we saw in 2018.\nJohn Inch: Nick, are you still on track to get to the 20% margins in Europe? I forget exactly what you said in November, what your timeline was, but how is that tracking? Is that ahead of schedule, or just on track? \nNicholas Gangestad: Yes, we\u2019re on track to do that, John. 2019 will be a noticeable year where we\u2019ve done a number of things in \u201917 and \u201918 to set us up for that. \u201919 will be a year of seeing noticeable margin improvement to get us on track to that 20% by 2020.\nJohn Inch: Twenty percent by 2020 - okay. Then there\u2019s a lot of moving parts here to this guide. I understand why you took the lower end of the range down a point, but the midpoint if you adjust for MModal really only declines by $0.05, which I guess you could argue that\u2019s the impact of half a point, but there must be some other things. I\u2019m curious - specifically on raw materials, I get what you\u2019re saying; on the other hand, Nick, didn\u2019t you say that tariffs would be fully offset, and versus November, this raw material productivity, the minus-$0.20 to minus-$0.10, is that actually lower, because obviously things like oil and other things have actually declined, so just trying to calibrate why, even though you lowered the guide where only the midpoint is $0.05 lower, is any of this being offset because raw materials are, while still a headwind, slightly better? If that makes sense.\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes, if I had shown this, what we expected it look like in November, I would have been showing a higher raw material headwind there as we\u2019ve seen with oil and some of the things that we were expecting on tariffs haven\u2019t turned out quite as bad as what we were estimating. Back in November I said we were confident that we could more than offset whatever we see with raw materials and tariffs with our selling prices, and we remain, I\u2019d say, even more confident on that front.\nJohn Inch: Then just lastly, Nick, how did the semicon piece of 3M do specifically? Remind us, is that about a billion dollars? I know consumer electronics is around 2. Did semicon--was it seeing the weakness particularly in Asia that a lot of these companies are calling out, or did you do better; and if you did better actually, why do you think that\u2019s the case?\nMichael Roman: John, maybe I\u2019ll take that. If you look at the business, our electronic materials business has got the semiconductor piece of it. It\u2019s not the largest piece of that. When you look at that, we\u2019ve got other businesses in there. We\u2019ve got materials into consumer electronics, we have assembly solutions, but a big portion of it goes into semicon. We certainly expected to see some slowing as we went through the quarter. As Nick talked about, they were in line, that business was in line with the overall 3% growth that we saw in the quarter. Going forward, there\u2019s more caution in that marketplace and the semiconductor manufacturers are part of that, so I would say it was less of an impact on Q4 but more of part of the caution as we guide going into \u201919.\nJohn Inch: Understood, got it. Thanks guys, appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nLaurence Alexander: Hi, two quick ones. Could you characterize what you\u2019re seeing in Latin America in a little bit more detail, like where the pockets of strength are, and can you speak a little bit more broadly about in 2019 - 2020 what kind of impact you may see on 3M from emerging market customers realigning their supply chains to work around the current tariff disputes?\nMichael Roman: Laurence, talking about Latin America first, we saw broader based growth in Latin America across our portfolio, both Brazil and Mexico, the largest countries there, performing well as we came through Q4. It was pretty balanced and pretty broad-based in portfolio and growth, and we have that same kind of outlook as we look to 2019.  To your question about the supply chain and are we seeing changes there, it\u2019s certainly something we watch for. We expect the supply chain to react over time as tariffs come into play. We haven\u2019t seen a significant impact to that at this point - it just hasn\u2019t shown up that way. We watch it closely with the customer and we\u2019re connected with them on the design and specification of our products, and that includes pretty good visibility on the supply chain. We just haven\u2019t seen it react that strongly to this point.\nLaurence Alexander: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, good morning, and thanks for going long here. Can you hear me okay?\nMichael Roman: Yes.\nNigel Coe: Good. I\u2019m having some problems with the phones here, so I\u2019m on a cell phone. Just want to go back to the electronics outlook for zero to 4, and obviously you\u2019ve provided some [indiscernible] in terms of quarterly cadence. If we dig into the businesses, electronics business, energy, are you seeing any appreciable difference in the two sub-segments for \u201919? \nMichael Roman: Nigel, you\u2019re talking about the sub-segments of energy, or you\u2019re talking about energy versus electronics?\nNigel Coe: Energy versus electronics, and looking at that 2% midpoint, how would that break out between the two sub-segments.\nMichael Roman: Yes, we highlighted the good performance from energy markets in Q4, and we have an outlook for that to continue as we go into 2019, so I would say that is more of the same. The electronics, we\u2019ve been coloring that all morning based on the outlook in the end markets, so I would say that\u2019s the one that we\u2019re a little more cautious about. Energy looks pretty stable as we go into the year, but both of them contributing, I would say, evenly across the year, with that kind of caution on the end markets in play. \nNigel Coe: Okay. Is there any appreciable difference in the margin profile between energy and electronics? I\u2019ve always assumed electronics was higher margins, but could you clarify that?\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes Nigel, there\u2019s really not a discernible difference between the margins in the different components there, between our electronics and our energy. They\u2019re very similar, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Then Nick, if you could just quickly clarify the comments you made on safety and graphics margins for 4Q. You called out Scott Safety integration headwinds, but then we\u2019re comping against some of the purchase accounting headwinds in 4Q17, so I\u2019m just wondering why we wouldn\u2019t have seen a benefit from Scott Safety in 4Q18.\nNicholas Gangestad: When I\u2019m backing out last year, there were one-time costs with Scott, bringing them in, as well as the gain that we had on the sale of our electronic monitoring business. When I go and say it\u2019s 110 basis point underlying margin contraction, that\u2019s already discounting for that piece. Now that we\u2019ve taken that out and it\u2019s part of our ongoing business, we are continuing to take actions in Scott and other parts of our safety and graphics business, but Scott\u2019s the largest one that we\u2019re taking actions on. That\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s behind that.  The other piece that I maybe didn\u2019t highlight clearly enough for you, Nigel, is the sales decline that we\u2019re seeing in roofing granules, that is creating a year-on-year margin contraction in safety and graphics that\u2019s impacting that total. \nNigel Coe: Understood, thanks Nick.\nOperator: That concludes the question and answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.\nMichael Roman: Thank you. In summary, the fourth quarter capped another year of significant accomplishments for 3M as we posted good results while strengthening our company for the long term. Moving ahead, we are focused on executing our four priorities and delivering for our customers and shareholders in 2019. Thank you again for joining us this morning, and have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the 3M Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, October 23, 2018. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2018 business review. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chief Executive Officer; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Nick will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentations accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our upcoming investor events found on Slide 2. First, we will be hosting our Investor Day at your headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota in a few weeks with a welcome reception in the evening of Wednesday, November 14th where we will be highlighting how 3M Science is advancing our priority markets for growth. Along with the formal presentation program, on Thursday November 15, the presentations will discuss our new five-year plan along with our preview of our 2019 outlook. If you plan to attend the event and have not yet responded, please RSVP right away. Second, our Q4 Earnings Conference call will take place on Tuesday, January 29, 2019. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note that throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendices of today's presentation and press release. Please turn to Slide 4 and I'll hand out to Mike. Mike?\nMike Roman: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone and thank you, for joining us. In the third quarter 3M delivered a double-digit increase and cash flow and earnings per share along with strong margins despite slower growth. We also continue to execute on business transformation or deploying capital to invest in our future and return cash to our shareholders. Looking at the numbers, our team posted total sales of $8.2 billion in the quarter. We delivered organic growth of 1% which is on top of 7% growth in last year's third quarter. As you recall from the discussion on our July earnings call, our ERP rollout in the US resulted in revenue shifting between Q2 and the second half of the year. Today, we estimate a pull forward into Q2 was approximately 100 basis points with the vast majority coming out of Q3. Moving on to earnings per share, we posted EPS of $2.58, an increase of 11% year-over-year. Our company continues to deliver strong return on invested capital along with premium margins. Companywide we generated margins of 25% with all business groups above 22%. Our team also increased free cash flow by 24% year-over-year with a conversion rate of 114%. This is a testament to the strength of portfolio and business model, and our focus on driving productivity every day. We also continue to invest in R&D and capital to support organic growth while returning cash to our shareholders. And in the quarter, we returned $1.9 billion to 3M shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Please turn to Slide 5 for look at the performance of our business groups for both the third quarter and year-to-date. In the third quarter, three of our five business groups, Electronics and Energy, Industrial and Safety and Graphics posted organic growth of 2%. Healthcare and Consumer each had areas of strength, but also areas that were softer than expected. Healthcare's growth declined by 1% primarily due to continued weakness in our drug delivery business. Organic growth in Consumer was down 2%. This business group was impacted by channel adjustments between quarters with our major retail customers, though the sellout of our products remains strong. In his comments, Nick will provide more detail on third quarter performance of each business group. Given the shift of sales between quarters due to business transformation, it is also helpful to look at our performance through nine months. Safety and Graphics posted 6% growth followed by 3% growth from both Industrial and Electronics and Energy. Healthcare posted 2% growth with Consumer at 1%. Companywide, we have delivered organic growth of more than 3% year-to-date. I will come back to share our updated guidance after Nick takes us through the details of the quarter. Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 6. Sales grew 1.3% organically in the third quarter and are up 3.3% year-to-date. Increases in selling prices contributed 120 basis points to sales growth in the quarter, with positive price growth across all geographic areas. The net impact of acquisition and divestures contributed 20 basis points to sales growth in the quarter. Foreign currency translation decreased sales by 1.7 percentage points, all in third quarter sales in US dollars were down 20 basis points versus last year. In the US, organic growth was 0.5% with positive growth in Electronics and Energy, Industrial and Safety and Graphics. Q3 organic growth was impacted by the deployment of our new ERP system in the US during the quarter. Year-to-date organic growth in the US is up 3%. Asia-Pacific delivered 3.2% organic growth led by Healthcare and Safety and Graphics. Organic growth was 10% in China, Hong Kong, while Japan was down 7% or up 1% excluding our electronic related businesses. Year-to-date Asia Pacific is up 4.5% organically. EMEA declined 90 basis points in Q3 with West Europe down 25. From a year-to-date standpoint EMEA is up 2%. Finally, Q3 organic growth in Latin America, Canada was 2.1% led by Healthcare and Consumer. At a country level, organic growth in Brazil was 5%; Mexico was up 3% while Canada was flat. On a year-to-date basis, Latin America, Canada is up 4% organically. Please turn to Slide 7 for the third quarter P&L highlights. Companywide third quarter sales were $8.2 billion with operating income of $2 billion. Third quarter operating income margins were 24.7%, up slightly versus last year. Let's take a closer look at the components of our margin performance in the third quarter. Organic volume, productivity and lower year-over-year portfolio and footprint actions added 70 basis points to margins. Selling price benefit more than offset raw material inflation which added a net 30 basis points to the third quarter margin. For 2018, we now expect full year raw material headwinds inclusive of tariff impacts of minus $0.15 per share versus a prior range of negative $0.05-$0.10 per share. We continue to expect benefits from selling price to more than offset raw material headwinds. Nearly offsetting these margin benefits during the quarter was a 50 basis point headwind from foreign currency. A 30 basis point impact from acquisitions and 10 basis point headwind from the Q2 divestiture of the communications markets business. Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at earnings per share. Third quarter GAAP earnings were $2.58 per share, up 11% versus last year. The benefits of organic growth, productivity and lower year-on-year portfolio and footprint actions added a combined $0.12 to per share earnings in the quarter. Acquisitions added a $0.01 with a divested incoming and transition cost from the communications markets divestiture wherein earnings headwind of $0.03 per share. Foreign-currency net of hedging reduced per share earnings by $0.08 as the US dollar strengthened against many currencies throughout the quarter. For the full year, we now expect an earnings headwind from foreign-currency of minus $0.05 per share versus a prior estimated benefit of $0.10 or a reduction of $0.15 per share versus previous expectations. Higher year-on-year net interest expense and retirement benefit expense decreased earnings by $0.05 per share. Our Q3 tax rate was 21.3% which increased earnings by $0.22 per share. This earnings benefit was primarily driven by the US Tax Reform. Lastly, a reduction in shares outstanding added $0.06 to per share earnings. Please turn to Slide 9 for a look at our cash flow performance. As Mike noted, we continue to generate strong operating cash flow allowing us to consistently invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. Third quarter free cash flow was $1.8 billion, up 24% year-on-year with a conversion rate of 114%. Third quarter capital expenditures were $377 million, up $52 million year-on-year, and we expect these investments to be approximately $1.6 billion for the year. In addition to investing in our businesses, we return significant cash to shareholders in Q3 including $794 million in dividends. We also returned $1.1 billion to shareholders to gross share repurchases. We continue to expect full year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion. Let's now review our business group performance starting with Industrial on Slide 10. The Industrial business group delivered third quarter sales of $3 billion, up 2.2% organically with growth across all geographic areas. Our automotive OEM business continues to drive increased penetration across applications such as structural tapes, adhesives, and acoustics light weighting and electronics solutions. Overall, our business was up 5% in the quarter compared to global car and light truck builds which were down nearly 2%. The automotive aftermarket business declined low single-digit organically due to softness in the collision repair market. Our Industrial adhesives and tapes business and filtration were both up low single digits in the quarter. Finally, the Advanced Materials business led the way with double organic growth in the quarter. On a geographic basis, industrials organic growth was led by a 3% increase in Asia Pacific followed by the US, up 2%. Industrial delivered third quarter operating income of $667 million with operating margin of 22.1%. Please turn to Slide 11. Safety and Graphic sales were $1.7 billion, up 2.2% organically in Q3. Growth was led by our personal safety business up 5% organically on top of a 14% increase last year. The integration of Scott Safety is on track and the business continues to exceed our expectations. Transportation safety grew mid-single digits while Commercial Solutions was up low-single digits. Finally, our roofing granules business declined mid teens as shingle manufacturers slowed production in the quarter. Geographically, organic growth was led by 5% growth in Asia-Pacific. Operating income in the third quarter was $412 million while operating margins were 24.8%, which includes a 150 basis point headwind from the Scott Safety acquisition. Please turn to Slide 12. Our Healthcare business generated third quarter sales of $1.4 billion down 1.1% organically versus a 7% comp last year. Holding back both third quarter and full year organic growth in healthcare has been the continued softness in our drug delivery business, which is depended on pharmaceutical regulatory timelines and customer R&D budgets. This business saw a 25% year-over-year decline in Q3 organic growth, which negatively impacted overall healthcare organic growth by 250 basis points. While our drug delivery business is experiencing near-term challenges, the pipeline continuously to strengthen and we expect the business to stabilize in 2019. Oral care grew 2% organically with improved growth in the US and continued strength in developing markets. Our 3M Clarity Clear Tray Aligners launch is off to a good start as the number of new cases ramps quickly and we expect continued momentum going forward. Our Medical Solutions business declined slightly against a strong comp of 7% from a year ago. Through nine months this business was up 3% with particular strengths in vascular access and advanced wound care solutions. Food safety continues to deliver strong organic growth in the quarter, up high-single digits while Health Information Systems grew mid-single digits. On a geographic basis Asia-Pacific led the way up 10% with Latin America, Canada up 4%. EMEA was down slightly while the US declined mid-single digits primarily due to last year's strong comp. Healthcare's third quarter operating income was $446 million and operating margins were nearly 31%. Next, let's cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 13. Electronics and Energy organic sales growth was 2.3% in the third quarter. Sales were $1.4 billion. The electronic side of the business grew 1% led by a mid single digit increase in electronics materials solutions. This business continues to experience strong demand particularly in the semiconductor and datacenter market. In addition, we continue to see our content per mobile device grow globally as we apply 3M science to the advancement of this market. Our energy related businesses were up over 6% organically with strong growth in renewable energy and pipe coating solutions. On a geographic basis, the US was up 5% while both Asia Pacific and Latin America, Canada were up low single digits. Third quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $457 million with operating margins of 31.7%. Please turn to Slide 14. Third quarter sales in Consumer were $1.2 billion and organic growth declined 2% year-on-year. Our Home Improvement business grew low single digits organically, while the other three businesses each declined in the quarter. Looking at consumer geographically, organic growth was led by a 5% increase in Latin America, Canada. The US was down slightly impacted by our Q3 ERP rollout. We continue to see strong consumer demand for our products with mid single digit point to sale growth. EMEA declined mid single digit as we've been actively managing our product portfolio. Lastly, Asia Pacific declined 7% as we've seen lower channel demand for our consumer respiratory solutions. Third quarter operating income was $291 million with operating margin of 23.5 %. That wraps up our review of third quarter results. Please turn to Slide 15 and I'll hand it back over to Mike to review our updated 2018 guidance. Mike?\nMike Roman: Thank you, Nick. With three quarters behind us, we are updating our guidance for the full year. We now anticipate organic growth of approximately 3% versus a prior range of 3% to 4%. With respect to earnings, we expect adjusted EPS in the range of $9.90 to $10 against the previous range of $10.20 to $10.45. Our change in EPS guidance is largely due to three factors; our updated growth expectations along with our updated guidance for currency and raw materials that Nick mentioned earlier. Looking at the remainder of 2018 and beyond, we know there's a lot more we can and will do to deliver for our customers and shareholders. Going forward, we are focused on driving growth being relentless and putting our customers first and continuing to transform 3M to deliver greater productivity. This means we will continue to work to optimize our portfolio prioritizing resources to our most attractive opportunities. We will strengthen our innovation model and continue to invest in research and development, which enables us to create unique solutions that advance, enhance and improve outcomes for our customers. In addition, we will continue to invest in high-growth, high-value product platforms such as automotive electrification, advanced wound care and data centers. We will also step up our efforts to fully leverage the progress we've made on business transformation. With our most recent deployment in the United States we have now successfully deployed 70% of our global revenue on the new ERP system. I am pleased with the success of our rollouts in Europe and the US. This was a significant undertaking and I thank our team for their tireless efforts. Moving ahead, we'll be able to focus even more on leveraging the power of business transformation to improve service levels to our customers, improve productivity and accelerate value realization, and at our Investor Day next month, we look forward to sharing more details about our plans. With that, we thank you for your attention and will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research; please proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Thanks. Good morning, guys. I don't recall covered your stock a long time-- I just don't recall the type of volatility you had in the Healthcare business, the drug delivery you mentioned was down 25% is this - can you give us a little bit granularity behind what causes or is causing that kind of volatility right now?\nMike Roman: Yes. Scott as we talked about on the opening here, the organic growth was impacted by drug delivery down double digits. And also we did have a strong year-over-year comp as we came through Q3 of 2017. Broader we see solid growth in oral care, our food safety business continue to strong growth, health information systems, strong pipeline right where we expected. So must of the rest of portfolio is in line with expectations. I would say that the drug delivery business continues to be the challenge against what we saw for the growth for the total year.\nScott Davis: So, yes, I am not sure that answers my question. Is there an inventory de-stock at the customer level? I'm trying to just think about that, I'm assuming the customer, the end consumer still consuming these drugs-- so what's going on at the part of the pharmaceutical companies at least that's what I am asking?\nMike Roman: Yes, so our drug delivery business it's-- it's - we've talked about it as a project based business in the past. It really is-- we work in partnership with pharmaceutical companies really dependent on their regulatory cycle also we have significant R&D partnership as well and those are project based businesses as well. So we see strong pipeline ahead. We are working through a challenging performance in 2018. We see stabilization as we get into 2019 and strong growth. So we have good view of our pipeline but not impacting positively as we go through the second half of this year.\nScott Davis: Okay. That's a good answer. And then Consumer, you talked about the inventory channel de-stock, is this --is this kind of a new normal where it seems like the retailers are just holding less inventory, do you view it as a new normal adjustment kind of one time or is this something where you anticipate some additional de-stock here going forward?\nMike Roman: Yes, it's been something that we've seen with the office channel over the last year and a half almost two years now where you see a restructuring of the channel and you see a destocking as the traditional office channel restructures around the new normal for them. I think we see it more broadly as well that we are a point of sales is strong up mid single digit across portfolio, both the retail channel is at least as we come to this second half of the year see additional restructuring in. And we expect some of that to continue as we move ahead. This is a space that's been disrupted significantly and it's something that we expect to see some individual channels as we move ahead, but really it's the broader base in the second half that's impacting us now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks, good morning, guys. Can we maybe start on just US growth? So I recognize that the ERP transition probably impacted growth little bit this quarter and I think Mike you mentioned a 100 basis points earlier. But I'm just parse out like how much of-- how much of the 50 basis points of growth you saw this quarter is related to ERP versus like what you're seeing from an end-market perspective just give that the US has been so strong across industrial for most of the year.\nMike Roman: Yes. So if you look at that 100 basis points so we talked about, that's a worldwide view are really 250 basis points of impact on the quarter in the US. And as I mentioned we saw most of that, the vast majority of given back in Q3. So year-to-date up 3% is more in line with when you look through that what we're seeing. And we see positive growth in Industrial, Safety and Graphics Electronics and Energy and really we see the macro more broadly in the US positive and steady. It was, I would say-- we're back talking about our Healthcare organic growth being impacted by our drug delivery business in the US and a strong year-on-year comp in the US especially strong in that area, and then I would say consumer organic growth was impacted by that US ERP as strong as anyone any one of the businesses in our portfolio. So, they had their full share of those 250 basis points.\nJoe Ritchie: And Mike is it your assumption going into 4Q that the ERP overhang kind of subsides or is that something that just carries into 4Q as well?\nMike Roman: Yes, I think that's the view we saw the vast majority come out in Q3 so that's not the big impact as we go into Q-- as we go into Q4.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. And then my one follow-up just on China obviously through the first three quarters of the year things have held up very good; we're seeing signs of things slowing down particularly on the Consumer side, I'm just curious if you can give any color around the trends that you saw through the quarter and what you're seeing specifically with the Chinese consumer?\nMike Roman: Yes, we mentioned that the slowing in the consumer respiratory protection space as one of the impacts. We see other signs of slowing in China, automotive build rates are down significantly. And that has a knock on effect and so you see some broader softness in industrial as we go into Q4. So we are seeing the same thing that's why we see ourselves tracking more to 8% to 10% range for China for the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Please proceed.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning guys. Mike can you give us more color what happened in Europe this quarter? We know you are expecting a slowdown in the US given the ERP. You just talked about China but EMEA seemed to fall off significantly for you versus last quarter. I think Western Europe was up 6 last quarters and down 2 this quarter. So as Western Europe, is the European decline acquire just more lumpiness or is there something a little more worrisome there?\nMike Roman: Yes, so our broader Europe is tracking to the low end of the-- of the range that we had for the year and the 1% to 4%. As we came into the quarter the Industrial and auto build rates softened a bit and we saw softening across West Europe and organic growth declined in the quarter up slightly year-to-date and we think up slightly for the full year and so at the bottom end of the range. I think it's also being impacted by some of the portfolio actions that that we are taking as we talked about as we've gone through the year part of our plan to improve the overall performance of the portfolio and the profitability of West Europe as we move ahead, but tracking low single-digits at the at the bottom of our range for the year.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Mike, do you have this visibility though into that sort of low single-digit growth as you go forward because it has been a very lumpy region for you?\nMike Roman: Yes. I think we have good visibility across the portfolio and the markets and I would say that the softening in the automotive and the build rates have an impact there. We have been talking about this being towards the low end of the range all year really because of the outlook we have across the markets in our portfolio and also some of those actions we've been taking. So I think it's consistent a little softer than expected in Q3, but, again, for the full year we think it's about in the range where we expected it to be.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: And then Nick your price with raw material plus point three, pricing up one point obviously good results there. Can you maintain positive price versus raws even if tariff continue to ramp? And could you talk about how you are adjusting raw material sourcing under supply chain to adjust to the inflationary environment, especially if we see more tariffs moving forward?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Andy, we are continuing to see raw material price increases and so our pricing has more than been offsetting that and Andy it's our expectation that will continue. We are anticipating continued increase in raw material prices and layering on tariffs that we expect our price strength to continue to more than offset that. If I fast forward a little into 2019, we think tariffs will be having a negative impact on our total sourcing cost. There are a number of things we're doing around that source changes, supply-chain changes but also pricing changes. And I'll talk more about this in on November 15th but our view is we have approximately $100 million headwind from tariffs. And that our pricing will more than offset that and raw material price increases in to 2010.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Just a question around the moving parts in the P&L, particularly I guess your SG&A was down sort of 90 bps a share of sale, R&D down 40 bps a share of sales to offset falling gross margin. Is there any change to the view that R&D to sales of 6% is the right number and what's the risk I guess that R&D and SG&A expenses have to sort of snap back up over the next 12 months?\nMike Roman: Yes. Julian, let me take the R&D part first. On the research and development as you heard of stock, it's heartbeat of 3M, it's the center of innovation and it's the key for us sustaining our performance, premium margins, our growth, our return on invested capital. So it's still a top priority for us and a top priority for me as CEO. We are going to continue to invest in it, continue to target that approximately 6% to sales and if you look at the quarter majority of the year-over-year decline in the quarter was really due to a couple of factors; FX of course the contract R&D work that-- that I talked about in the drug delivery business was part of it, and also the divestiture of the communication market. So, that-- it's really and there are some quarterly up and downs as we make investments in experiments and a number of projects and so it's still very much the focus there. If you look at SG&A, I think that's another one that. We --our spending is not completely smooth, but we're making improvements as well on productivity. That's one of the things that we're getting as we move forward business transformation as we take now 70% of our revenue onto business transformation. We have opportunities to leverage our service models and engage in some improvements there. So, you know, at least a little bit of what we saw in the quarter was starting to see some productivity there, and I think of the actions that we've been-- strategic investments we've been making impacting that as well.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks and then my follow-up question would be around Healthcare, you had laid out-- or the management team had laid out the 4% to 6% top-line growth aspiration two and half years ago; Healthcare is consistently run at or slightly below the bottom end of that range even prior to the drug delivery issues. So do you think that's the addressable market growth coming in light or do you think there is a need of 3M itself to step up M&A and/or R&D to close the gap with the growing market?\nMike Roman: Yes, Julian, I would say that - I talked about the broader portfolio. We have much of the rest of the portfolio beyond drug delivery that's in line with our expectations. And if you if you step back and look at the 4% to 6% and where we are now in the 2% to 3% range versus that 4% to 6% or even as we as we kind of reset and said 4% as we came through the year, it's largely drug delivery and slower oral care. We saw a better oral care performance in the quarter as we move through the year; kind of what we expected, but, still when you look against that 4% to 6% those are the two impacts - that our biggest impact. The year-over-year comps are part of it in the quarter, but if you look at the total year now - those are the impacts. We expect Q4 to be a return to our historical growth rates in healthcare so as we lap some of the drug delivery comps and we get those broader performing portfolios to have a bigger impact.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Winoker: Thanks. Good morning. Hey Mike, I just want to characterize what you're really seeing out there; you've already from a growth perspective, if you take out the ERP impact, if you take out what you would describe as kind of disrupted channel related to distributor and retail destocking, I guess you have slowing China and some European challenge, and you take out the Europe-- the drug delivery are you seeing kind of any short-cycle slowing globally from a demand perspective or do you think these are all kind of more 3M specific issues that you're going to be getting through and then normalizing?\nMike Roman: Yes, see I think you've characterized it well. The areas that we've talked about already, and we have highlighted number of businesses where there specific to our markets and our businesses in those markets. I would say that we've performed well and automotive as Nick noted we performed well in the automotive OEMs are relative to their bill grades, but their bill rates continue to move down negative actually in the quarter and part of the slowing in China and part of the impact in Europe as well. We highlighted as well, safety and graphics has been at the top of the range that we have guided for the year and really was we expect them to be there at the end of the year but we're impacted by a negative mid teens growth in our industrial mineral business, that's another one. But again it's kind of a maybe it's our focus on construction markets and some of the challenges we see in some of those end markets, but that was definitely softness in one of our markets. So, broader we see a steady and positive macro and broader our portfolio the majority of our businesses continue to do well against that broader macro.\nSteven Winoker: Okay, and then and I of course on that, it doesn't change your sort of normal 1.5x IPI thinking?\nMike Roman: Well, yes. It's on the broader portfolio absolutely and as we move ahead that's the model that we look at it, individual business is impacting the way they did here in the quarter and maybe a couple of them as we go through the second half, it's those are - those will take away from some of that near term, but yes, that's absolutely our performance, that's our focus, that's our expectations, that's our capacity and capability that we demonstrated.\nSteven Winoker: And I don't want to miss read your portfolio optimization comment towards the end of your prepared remarks. But that is something that 3M certainly had been emphasizing for sometime with Inge and with you before, so do you need something different here in this - what do you mean by that?\nMike Roman: Well, that you said it; portfolio management has been one of our key leverage. It's a driver of value for us, you look at the performance we have in electronics and energy and in safety and graphics as we come through the year those business are performing well and they have been an area that we focused a lot of our portfolio that actions around it's what we have done to reposition and reshape those portfolios through acquisition and divestitures and other actions, I think that's an example of where we take that lever and really create value and so we're always looking at that, we are always realigning our businesses around our portfolio priorities it's how we reshape the company for near term and long-term success. So it's I guess and I said that at the last call as well, we are in active portfolio of manager this is what we do to take full advantage of the 3M model as we move ahead.\nSteven Winoker: Okay, and if I can just sneak in one specific think for Nick. On the inventory days and I suppose receivables. Just slight increases that are going out there. I assume that's all ERP related or is there something else going on?\nNick Gangestad: No. Steve, that's exactly - we had built some inventory in advance of going live in the US with our new ERP system. And we wanted to do that in order to ensure we were fully satisfying our customers and their supply chain and the increase you are seeing there is that not bleeding off quite as fast as we had planned but we see over the next couple of quarters that inventory coming down.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett. Please proceed.\nJohn Inch: Thanks, good morning everyone. Hi, guys. So, Mike it sounds like your characterizing Europe and maybe Asia Pac a little bit as relatively stable. I think that's kind of messaging that I am getting maybe at a slightly decelerated basis. I wanted just kind of confirm that's what you're seeing Brexit or any other issues are not necessarily sequentially affecting your businesses and on that basis, is this causing you this kind of low level activity stability, because you're very big company in Europe. Is it causing you to allocate your R&D or your growth initiatives in any kind of a different way to try and stimulate things more quickly to circumvent auto, just curious on those fronts.\nMike Roman: Yes, John I think you characterized West Europe and Europe overall the way we kind of view it right now, and again we see some markets like auto impacting Europe as well, drug delivery of course impacting Europe as well. But more broadly we see it a steady economic backdrop, we're not looking at other significant changes there. And Asia I guess I would characterize it maybe at the low end of our range that we had looked at for the year so softer overall but again steady across more broadly with sometimes as long as I've said in China. And so if you look back at West Europe, your question there we are --we deployed the business transformation there over the 2015-16-17 and we're now taking advantage of that and we are I would say doing a couple of things, it's enabling us to prioritize better where we really do invest in our best parts of our portfolio. It's the models that we have in place the service models that we have in place there up and running be able to leverage area wide ERP capability. Those are really enabling us to I think bring even sharper focus on prioritizing and that's part of our active portfolio management as prioritizing where we put our resources for growth shifting resources to those higher growth areas. We're also as planned taking some actions to I would say streamline our structure in EMEA and even Latin America as we get ready for the go live taking advantage of business transformation so that's really also helping us the focus on the markets in areas that are most important and best opportunities for growth as we go ahead.\nJohn Inch: So on that point you just read about business transformation ERP maybe this is for Nick, Nick give us a sense of how much BTU may have actually net contributed in the quarter and I know you haven't really updated your 500 to 700 target in Ohio right from business transformation specifically but can you give us at least an elementary advances as this is coming through. Are we looking at the low end or the high end of that range or a new range all together?\nNick Gangestad: As far as the savings, John, we are --what we've been saying and continue to say is that by 2020 we expect this to generate between $500 million and $700 million of operating income benefit. this year we're on track for approximately $100 million of savings versus last year, that will bring our total savings since we started that on an annual basis up to $250 million and we remained on track on the 500 to 700 not ready to call whether we think more likely low end or high end, but we still see ourselves in that range by 2020. And as Mike mentioned earlier on this call we have a lot of the deployment behind us now and that's allowing us in 2019 to be putting even more energy and resources into realizing the value realization that that we've been projecting so a little bit of a shift of little less on deployment and more on the value realization and the business process changes that will create that.\nJohn Inch: And to be clear about $100 million is a net number right like that goal flowing to the bottom line pretax?\nNick Gangestad: That's exactly right John.\nJohn Inch: And then one more just nitpick here. Why haven't you updated the 500 to 700? I mean this goes back a few years ago right. Is there some obvious reason why should base on the nature of the way this stuff is working that you can't --you haven't actually provided some sort of look forward based on progress or realized results is that just because the U.S. would save for the last and it's the biggest slug or is there some other reason why this thing is not being updated or would have been updated sort of more quickly?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. We last updated that number in 2016 when we laid out a five year plan and we've continued to progress as we expected towards that. November 15th when we lay out our next five year plan we'll be updating that if where this goes even beyond 2020 and so partly John it lines up with longer term plans that we lay out and you can expect to see more from us on in November.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi good morning guys. Just I know there've been a lot of questions on growth and maybe not quite what we would have expected in terms of some of the bigger global controversial end markets like auto or the consumer in U.S. and China, it don't seem to be as big of a drag a lot more 3M specific stuff which I think some of the earlier questions have noted. Do you feel like over next couple of quarters and I don't want to get into 2019 too specifically, but do you think there is a smooth hand off where some of the 3M specific issues or some of the submarkets start to balance out and we can still kind of swim upstream versus some of the more controversial ones like auto or is there potential for say someone have to bleed down further into your business?.\nMike Roman: Yes, Josh, if you look at some of the businesses we've highlighted today that are impacting growth as we come through Q3 and the second half. We'll, couple of things will happen. One we'll lap some of those comps as we move ahead. And they're going to expect. I mean we're, we expect to improve those businesses. And I mentioned in drug delivery that we stabilized based on what we have in the pipeline as we get into the 2019 and we returned to growth as we come out of that. And so we can look forward and we can see that stepping into it. Automotive is maybe a little more complex in the dynamic. I mean we're outgrowing the build rates and have consistently done that and with what we're doing with automotive electrification, we see our ability to do that to continue and even leverage our innovation further in the future. But we're still dependent on the build rates. And so what happens in those build rates as we move ahead where it goes in key markets like U.S., Europe, China, those are going to impact that. The outlook right now is fairly nominal low growth negative growth as we come through the quarter in third quarter, but slow growth as we move ahead. So I would say we'll continue to outgrow that that will continue to be a growth contributor with what we've been able to do there. Other markets industrial mineral what happens in the end market demand will dictate that more than us as we get into future quarters. So I think it's little bit market dependent, but the one examples that we've talked about, I think we do see ourselves being able to continue to rise up in our growth relative to those markets. If you go turn to consumer, the thing I would look at is our sale out continued strong. Our brands, we got category leading brands that are performing well off the shelf, we've got to work through, and I think our team is done a very good job of working through the channel disruption that's going on there and managing through that. We've got very good visibility as we move through that especially in developed markets. And we expect to see that sale out to eventually rise up and carry the day. And so we'll look for that as we go ahead too.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And maybe I could just follow on with the teaser for what you may talk about here in few weeks in November. Clearly a lot of questions about growth here on today. I think business transformation phase 1 has been a lot more margin centric and there is always been an aspiration for phase 2 to have a growth component. Is that something we could start to hear a little bit more about in the coming weeks or is that still few years off in terms of being quantified?\nMike Roman: Josh it goes to John's question and Nick's discussion earlier too. Our business transformation was focused on putting the ERP and much broader than the ERP other system capabilities in place new models transaction efficient models in place in our supply chain and in our back office. And that's we're doing with business transformation. But as we do that as we now get 70% of our revenue on the new systems, we can start to leverage that in other ways as well. And we'll be talking about at the November 15 Investor Day. We'll talk about where we see opportunities to do that on the commercial side and also in supply chain.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Walsh: Hi good morning. I guess just trying to put a finer point on the new organic growth guidance. A squiggle does imply a range, so I was just curious as we think about Q4 would you expect to see organic growth accelerate from the 13 we saw this quarter or how should we think about that?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, John. We're just a little over a 3% through the first nine months of the year for growth. And when we're estimating 3 that's our best estimate of what the total year growth will be? I don't see a very wide range on that maybe 20 basis points plus or minus but not a very wide range on that. And yes, that included in that as an expectation that we see higher organic growth in Q4 than what we saw in Q3.\nJohn Walsh: Great. Thank you for that. And then, you touched on the savings portion of business transformation, and how to think about that. But how should we think about the spending, obviously this year there were some restructuring around getting out of those stranded costs, but how do we think about the actual spending levels that you are absorbing in your earnings construct as we as we think about that into 2019.\nNick Gangestad: And John, you're specifically talking about our business transformation and what we're spending on that.\nJohn Walsh: However you wanted kind of define if you want to take a broader turn that, and if you want to kind of that one program.\nNick Gangestad: John, in terms of the business transformation, over a number of years, we've been saying this is going to be an incremental spends of a little over $1 billion. And as I look, as we look at our spending over the last few years, in terms of cash outflow that has been declining. In terms of total in spending, hitting our income statement as we start to amortize some of what we built there. It's been remarkable flat year-on-year of the total spend that we're putting into our business transformation initiative. And right now my view is that's going to continue and a pretty stable level for the next couple years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin: Good morning. Can you hear me? Just question on safety and graphics, I think you guys highlight a lot of headwinds when you were at Laguna, but that one is a bit of a surprise to me and a couple of things, organic growth, 2% margin declined year-over-year and particularly you guys highlighted roofing granules, declining double-digits, and as I recall, this was one of the businesses that was supposed to drive big growth and big margin expansion post everything you've done to it in terms of repositioning this business. Can you just talk what happened the quarter and has something changed here or is it a one off?\nNick Gangestad: Andrew the roofing granules business is the smallest business we have in Safety and Graphics. And it's a business that has been enjoying, in the U.S. some of the construction increases that they are going on in construction as well as there's a cyclical or a temporary nature depending on what's happening with storms. So in this business is very closely tied to shingle production. And right now, shingles manufacturers are making less, making less shingles. And it's a very tightly integrated supply chain. So for the last couple years this business has been on a path of high growth and we reached a point in the third quarter that, that growth has come down. And the growth going forward is going to be tightly correlated to what happens with shingle manufacturers in the amount of production they're doing.\nAndrew Obin: And is broader for safety and graphics margin decline year-over-year and sort of this growth that maybe 2%. Because I always thought, this was the business that was supposed to go tighten; this was the showcase of how you can sort of realign your portfolio and achieve better margins and better growth. I guess maybe a broader question here.\nNick Gangestad: Yes, broader question. So right now we're estimating this business to be about at the midpoint of the 4% to 6% organic growth that we guided at the beginning of the year. And that midpoint is absorbing what we're seeing as the impact from the roofing granules business. As far as the total growth in the third quarter. See in mid-single-digit growth in our personal safety business against a 14% comp in our personal safety, that is by far our biggest business. Andrew, we continue to have a lot of confidence in our safety and graphic business and its ability to grow and be a leader in growing 3M's total organic growth, a lot of confidence there. As far as the margin, we are absorbing 150 basis points of margin impact from Scott Safety and we'll be starting to look lap ourselves on that as we acquired that fourth quarter last year. And I no longer we'll see that as being dragged to the margin going forward and potentially accretive going after that.\nAndrew Obin: And just a follow-up sort of the counterpoint to safety and graphics. Everybody was concerned about electronics and energy and you guys actually posted really good growths throughout this expectation margin was north of 30%, is the margins sustainable or were they one-time items or how should we think about that?\nNick Gangestad: Andrew, if you look at the history of Electronics and Energy Q3 tends to be the high point for our revenue and our margin for that business. Year-to-date our margins are 28.4%; that's up 170 basis points in that. That includes the impact of exiting our communication markets business. So, yes, the portfolio management we have been doing and the things we are doing and investing in research, we see as being accretive to our margins in that business, but I would not call the 31 plus that we are at this-- in this quarter as a new level-- is more third quarter is typically the high point.\nAndrew Obin: But it's just-- there is no one-time big items, it's just everything one right for this business in this quarter. Is that fair to describe?\nNick Gangestad: That's exactly right, everything going right in this business this quarter; no one-time issue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Tusa: Hi guys, good morning. So, just so I kind of understand the comments on R&D correctly, are you saying that kind of that the-- the productivity which you are getting out of business transformation et cetera is allowing you to kind structurally kind of spend a lower level of R&D than the 6% going forward?\nMike Roman: Steve, I would-- I guess my message here is that we have not backed off of what we've been targeting with our R&D investment. This idea of investing to enable us to drive more of those priority growth platforms, more of the disruptive new technology, that's what we talked about when we move from 5.5% of sales to 6% to sales, and so while in the quarter we are down at 5.3, our strategy and our plan is to invest in line with what we've talked about when we said we are targeting 6%. It's not an efficiency that we are gaining there. There are some one-time kinds of impacts on the quarter just a little bit of ebb and flow-- we expected a little overspending just by the layout of our R&D programs as we went through the year, and then we had the drug delivery contract R&D work down. We had impact of FX and we had the divesture of communications markets. So, no-- they usually expect us to continue to drive that-- this is not a BT enabled-- we do-- we certainly do expect to get returns out of these investments and will adjust as we move ahead, but, near-term that's not-- that's not what's going on.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. When we kind of think about, how you are kind of positioned and how you are-- what your mindset is for the next several years, the last few years you have had a couple that have been pretty good, but not too many in the kind of double-digit EPS growth range, and that's despite some very heavy stock buyback activity, were you kind of providing a new framework for EPS at some point? Do you wonder in your watch at least? Or is the 8% to 11% still kind of a relevant number, and it's been a really steady as she goes on that front? Or are we going to get an update on that?\nMike Roman: Well, that's certainly one of the things we will be talking about the November Investor Day. That's-- we will be laying out our five-year plan and the framework for that five-year plan, and so I think that's something will cover in detail there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nNigel Wolfe: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to go back to the ENE margin, you mentioned everything went right but this is I think the second or third quarter where we have seen diversion trends between ENE and the rest of the portfolio, if you can just maybe just expand how you are seeing such strong open leverage in ENE versus -the -in those trends elsewhere?\nNick Gangestad: So, Nigel, what we have been seeing-- and I mentioned this earlier on this call, we are continued to see good penetration and content that we are putting into electronic devices, we are seeing good growth in places where we are selling into datacenters and semiconductors, that growth is helping us and is being accretive to our-- to our margin. In addition, the divesture of our communication markets business within that, which had been dilutive to our margin that is now, for all practical purposes, out of that business and we are also seeing some accretive benefits from that. So, that's what I was saying that many things going right this quarter. As we have focused on that portfolio and what we are investing in and we are seeing a lot of that pay off.\nNigel Wolfe: Okay but the key message is that we exit this year, obviously recognizing the seasonality from speaking in 4Q, whatever ENE is this year, is a good base for future years. Okay. And then my typical question again, kind of things about November, when we look at the last three to five years, core growth being in the 2% or 3% range on average, 2.7% for the last three years, I know you are not going to be satisfied with that kind of growth range, what in your mind is the biggest kind of restrain on growth here. Is the R&D pipeline, the commercialization; is it some share loss competition? What is the biggest recurring force on core growth here?\nMike Roman: Yes, Nigel, growth is a big focus as we drive forward, I mean it's what we expect our innovation model to deliver, and I would say above-market growth and premium margins. That's really a - I think the hallmark of successful innovation and for us that's been really our history. When we deliver on that, that's what we see. And we expect to see that outgrow the macro and to be able to do that consistently as we move ahead, and so that, that is the focus, that's what we will talk about at the Investor Day that's what we will focused on with our team. That's the way we-- that's where we start our focus as a team.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.\nMike Roman: In summary, our third quarter included good performances in many respects including double-digit increases in cash flow and EPS along with strong margins. As I look across our portfolio, most of our businesses continue to do well, but there are also areas that we must work to improve. Looking ahead, how we allocate capital and continue to reshape our portfolio are keys to delivering even greater value to both our customers and shareholders. These are strengths of 3M and will continue to be priorities for us moving forward. Thank you again for joining us this morning, and we look forward to seeing you in St. Paul in a few weeks. Have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference call for today.

Inge?\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Bruce and good morning, everyone. As you all are aware, Q2 was my last quarter as the CEO and I have now moved on to my new role as Executive Chairman of the 3M Board. Mike Roman is our new CEO and I am pleased with the orderly transition between me and Mike, which we have worked on for the last year. In a moment, I will turn the call over to Mike and our CFO, Nick Gangestad, and you will see that once again we had a very strong quarter with robust organic growth, margin expansion, EPS growth, and good cash flow. But before doing that, I would like to make a few comments. First, I would like to recognize all of you who have covered, analyzed, and invested in 3M. I have enjoyed our many interactions and I have always appreciated your input along with your integrity and professionalism. I would also like to thank all of our 91,000 3Mers around the world for your contributions and support. Working together, I am pleased at what we have accomplished over the last six years. We enhanced and focused our portfolio and as a result, today, we are far more relevant to our customers and the marketplace. We have strengthed our innovation engine and improved our cost structure and began to transform 3M for the future. We have reached for our vision of advancing every company, enhancing every home, and improving every life. All of this is reflected in our financial results and in the premium value we have created for our customers and premium returns for our shareholders. At the same time, I am equally confident in our future. The Board of Directors and I have no doubt that Mike is the right person to lead our Company as CEO and continue building strengths on strengths. As I look across our enterprise, it\u2019s clear that we have the leadership, market position, and capabilities to continue to build on the fundamental strength of 3M. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike for summary of our second quarter. Mike?\nMike Roman: Thanks, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that I am honored to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of this incredible enterprise and lead our team into the future. I would like to express my gratitude to Inge for his vision, leadership, and ongoing partnership in his new role as Executive Chairman. Over the last six years, we\u2019ve made great progress in building out the 3M playbook, which has created a tremendous foundation for us. Moving ahead, we are focused on continuing our momentum, generating extraordinary value for our customers and premium returns for our shareholders. Now let\u2019s review our second quarter results, starting on Slide 5. We had a strong quarter, highlighted by broad-based organic growth and a double-digit increase in earnings per share, along with record sales and rising margins. Looking at the numbers, total sales were $8.4 billion, an all time high for 3M. We delivered strong organic growth of 6% with positive growth across all business groups and all geographic areas. Please note that we have an upcoming ERP roll out in the United States, and in anticipation of that deployment, some of our customers decided to accelerate their purchases. We estimate that this added approximately 50 to 100 basis points of growth in the second quarter, all of it in the U.S. results. Moving on to earnings, we posted GAAP earnings of $3.07 per share, up 19% year-on-year. Adjusted earnings were $2.59 per share compared to $2.25 a year ago. This demonstrates that our teams around the world continue to execute well. Underlying margins were strong at 24% with all business groups above 21%. Beyond financial results, we are committed to building 3M for the long run, while returning cash to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we invested $468 million in research and development and another $365 million in CapEx. We also returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including both dividends and share repurchases. Please turn to Slide 6. There is a lot to like this quarter across our entire portfolio. Our Industrial team posted good organic growth of 6%, a nice pick up from the first quarter. Growth was broad-based with particular strength in our filtration platform where we are leveraging our Membrana acquisition to accelerate penetration in biopharma and life sciences. Safety and Graphics delivered another outstanding quarter of 9% organic growth, along with robust margins. For the fourth consecutive quarter, our personal safety business grew double-digits, as we continue to build and extend our industry-leading portfolio in this market. In Health Care, we continued to expand worldwide with organic growth of 4%, led by our medical solutions business with mid-single-digit growth. Health Care also posted double-digit growth in developing markets, as investments in those areas are paying off. This is a great business for 3M and we will continue to invest to strengthen it for the future. Organic growth in Electronics and Energy was 5% on top of 10% growth in last year\u2019s second quarter. Within this business group, we have done a lot of portfolio work over the last several years to improve our relevance to customers in the marketplace. This has led to improved growth and a sustained improvement in margins. Last month, we continued to build on this portfolio work with the sale of our communication markets business. After a thorough review, we decided that selling this business will result in the greatest value creation for 3M and our shareholders. This is a good example of how we are actively managing our portfolio to best utilize the 3M model. Going forward, we will continue to prioritize high growth opportunities in Electronics and Energy, such as automotive electrification, data centers, and semiconductor fabrication. Finally, organic growth in Consumer was 4%, which included good performances across our leading brands. We saw continued strength in home improvement, along with a strong start to the back-to-school season. In summary, I am pleased with our performance in the second quarter and I thank our teams to their many contributions. Our playbook is working and we are just getting started. We are well positioned to grow into an even stronger and more successful company. Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our portfolio, strengthen our innovation, and accelerate our transformation while developing our people. Nick will now take you through the details of the quarter. Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 7. Sales grew 5.6% organically in the second quarter. Increases in selling prices contributed 110 basis points to sales growth in the quarter, and were positive across all geographic areas. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures contributed 80 basis points to sales growth in the quarter. Foreign currency translation increased sales by one percentage point. All-in second quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 7.4% versus last year. In the U.S., organic growth was 5.6%, led by electronics and energy, safety and graphics and consumer. EMEA increased 5.8% in Q2, driven by strong growth in West Europe that was led by Electronics and Energy, Industrial and Safety and Graphics. Asia Pacific delivered 5.5% organic growth, led by Health Care and Safety and Graphics. Organic growth was 12% in both China, Hong Kong, and India, while Japan was down 2%. Finally, Q2 organic growth in Latin America and Canada was 6%, led by Health Care and Safety and Graphics. At a country level, Canada was up high single digits while Mexico and Brazil both delivered mid-single-digit organic growth. Please turn to Slide 8 for the second quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide, second quarter sales were $8.4 billion. Operating income in the second quarter was $2.4 billion, which included $400 million benefit from the communication markets divestiture gain net of related actions. Second quarter underlying operating margins were 24% excluding the net benefit from the communication markets divestitures. Let's take a closer look at the components of our margin performance in the second quarter. Leverage on organic growth improved productivity and lower year-on-year portfolio and footprint actions contributed a combined 290 basis points to margins. Selling price benefits more than offset raw material inflation, adding 30 basis points to operating margins. Foreign currency net of hedging impacts reduced margins by 20 basis points. Lastly, during the second quarter, we settled several respiratory and oral care related lawsuits, which decreased margins by 70 basis points. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 9 for a closer look at earnings per share. Second quarter GAAP earnings were $3.07 per share, up 19% year-over-year. Underlying earnings were $2.59 per share when adjusting for the communication markets divestiture gain net of related actions. Let me now discuss the primary drivers of the year-on-year increase in Q2 earnings per share. The benefits of organic growth, productivity and lower year-on-year portfolio and footprint actions, added a combined $0.47 to per share earnings in the quarter. The previously mentioned legal settlements reduced Q2 earnings by $0.7 per share. Higher year-on-year net interest expense and retirement benefit expense decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. Our underlying Q2 tax rate was 19.8%, which increased earnings by $0.16 per share. The lower tax rate was driven primarily by U.S. tax reform and the continued benefits from our supply chain centers of expertise. Lastly, lower shares outstanding added $0.04 to per share earnings. Please turn to Slide 10 for a look at our cash flow performance. Second quarter free cash flow was $1.5 billion, up 14.5% year-on-year. Free cash flow conversion was 83% in the quarter. This includes 16 percentage point headwind divestiture gain of the communication markets business and related actions. Second quarter capital expenditures were $365 million, up $63 million year-on-year. For the full year, we continue to anticipate CapEx investments in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. During the quarter, we paid $802 million in cash dividends to shareholders and returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through gross share repurchases. Through the first half of the year, we repurchased $2.5 billion of stock and now expect full year repurchases to be in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion versus $3 billion to $5 billion previously. Let's now review our business group performance, starting with industrial on Slide 11. The Industrial business group delivered second quarter sales of $3.1 billion, up 5.7% organically. Industrial's growth was broad-based across all geographic areas and businesses. Our advanced materials, abrasives, and separation and purification business led the way with high single digit growth in the quarter. Looking at the rest of the Industrial portfolio, our industrial adhesives and tapes, auto and aerospace and automotive aftermarket businesses, all delivered mid-single-digit growth in the quarter. On a geographic basis, Industrial\u2019s organic growth was led by a 7% increase in EMEA, followed by mid-single-digit growth in each of the other areas. Industrial delivered second quarter operating income of $724 million. Operating margins were 23% with underlying margins up 180 basis points, excluding the impact of last year's second quarter portfolio and footprint actions. Please turn to Slide 12. Second quarter safety and graphics sales were $1.8 billion, up 8.5% organically with strong growth across all businesses and geographies. As Mike mentioned, our personal safety business continued to post excellent growth, up double digits in the quarter. The integration of our Scott Safety business is performing well and we are pleased with the performance of the business. Commercial solutions was up high single digits while the transportation safety and roofing granules businesses, were both up mid-single digits. Geographically, organic growth was led by 10% growth in EMEA with high single digit increases in both the U.S. and Asia-Pacific. Latin America and Canada grew 6% organically in the quarter. Operating income was $480 million with operating margins up 26.4%. Please turn to Slide 13. Our Health Care business generated second quarter sales of $1.5 billion, up 3.8% organically. Our medical solutions business, which is our largest segment in Health Care, grew mid-single digits in Q2. Oral care was up 3% with continued good growth internationally, particularly in developing markets. Food safety grew high single digits, while health information systems grew mid-single digits. Finally, our project-based drug delivery business declined low single digits year-over-year. On a geographic basis, Asia-Pacific and Latin America and Canada lead the way, both up high single digits. EMEA grew 5% followed by 1% in the U.S. We saw continued strength in developing markets, up double digits led by China, Hong Kong growing in the high teens. Health Care's second quarter operating income increased 7% to $435 million. And underlying operating margins were just over 30%, adjusting for the impact of the legal settlement and the commercialization investments for our new Clarity aligners. Next, let's cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 14. Electronics and Energy organic sales growth was 5.2% in the second quarter. Sales were $1.3 billion. The electronics side of the business grew 4% organically, led by mid-single-digit growth in electronics materials solutions. Our energy related businesses were up 9% organically led by electrical markets up double digits. As mentioned, we closed on the sale of substantially all of the communication markets business in the quarter and expect to close the remaining portion by the end of the year. On a geographic basis, the U.S led with high single-digit organic growth, followed by mid-single-digit growth in both EMEA and Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Canada was up low single digits. Second quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $865 million with underlying operating margins of nearly 28%. Please turn to Slide 15. Second quarter sales in Consumer were $1.2 billion and organic growth was 4.3% year-on-year. Our home improvement business grew double digits organically, continuing its track record of strong performance. Our leading brands continue to win in the marketplace, particularly Command and Filtrete, both up double digits. The home care business and stationery and office supply business each delivered low single-digit growth in the quarter. While consumer health care declined. Looking at Consumer, geographically, growth was led by 7% increase in the U.S. followed by mid-single-digit growth in Latin America, Canada. In the second quarter, we continue to see strong consumer demand for our products in the U.S., particularly in the e-commerce channel. Finally, operating income was $261 million with operating margins of 21.4%. That wraps up our review of the second quarter results. Please turn to Slide 16, and I'll cover our updated 2018 guidance. Our full year organic growth expectations remain unchanged in the range of 3% to 4%. With respect to earnings, we now expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $10.20 to $10.45 versus a prior range of $10.20 to $10.55. The update to the range reflects the impact of the divested income associated with the communication markets business. Finally, please note that we now expect that foreign currency translation will add approximately 1% to full year sales growth versus the prior expectation of 2%. With that, we thank you for your attention and we'll now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Inge, you will be missed. You did a fantastic job as you know, and Mike, big shoes to fill, but I'm sure you'll do great as well. There\u2019s one thing that caught my eye just in the prepared remarks was your ERP rollout comments. Can you tell us, is that in every segment? Is that -- how big of a deal is this and what\u2019s your confidence level that the pull forward was just 50 to 100 and not something greater than that? Is it possible to have that kind of precision?\nInge Thulin: Scott, we\u2019ve been working on deploying our business transformation, our ERP rollout globally, for a number of years, and we have largely completed our deployment in Europe, West Europe, in particular. And now, as we came into 2018, we are focused on the U.S. And so it's a very well laid out plan of deployments by region, by business, by supply chain operations; and so we are over the next 18 months now deploying in the U.S., so we\u2019ve a very specific deployment by business. We did deploy our Health Care business at the end of last year. And so we have experience with that business in the deployment already complete, and now we\u2019re deploying the rest of the businesses in the U.S. as we go through the next 18 months. So we have a pretty clear view on which customers are impacted with the deployment at which periods of time, and so we have very good -- I think, pretty clear view of how much of the accelerated sales are in line with the deployment now that\u2019s taking place in the U.S.\nScott Davis: And then as a follow-up, I mean we've seen some pretty big moves in EM currency over the last quarter. What can you guys -- what's the playbook? Do you have to go in there and raise prices? Do you realign some supply chains? I mean, what\u2019s the playbook to manage that volatility?\nNick Gangestad: Scott, the playbook on there really isn't changing. We seek to have natural hedges against currency risk and how we set up the supply chain, and then we layer on top of that some financial hedges. And those financial hedges don't ultimately change the underlying financials over a longer period of time, but we have hedges that we enter into going out one, two, three years, to buy time for us to adjust our cost structure, our supply chain in order to end up with the competitive supply chain in a revised FX environment. So in the short term what we often do especially in emerging markets, we will adjust prices to partially offset the FX impact. And then we will adjust our supply chain adjusting where we\u2019re manufacturing based on FX movements. That tends to take a little longer time though, Scott. And not in a short-term, but we often have to change and re-qualify sources of supply to make that happen. For the year, Scott, I will say, we started the year guiding that FX with rates as they stood at the end of the year we thought that they would positively impact our earnings by about $0.10. Through the first few months of the year, the dollar weakened more and that pushed our EPS benefit that we were expecting slightly above that $0.10. In the last few months, we\u2019ve seen the dollar strengthen, and we now see ourselves slightly below that $0.10. And through the first half of the year, we have seen $0.06 EPS benefit from FX. And if we see meaningful changes to that $0.10 we originally guided, we\u2019ll provide updates on that accordingly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin: Inge, congratulations. Thanks, Mike. Look forward to working with you and the team. Just a question on guidance, if I look at income before taxes that you guys have on Slide 22, basically, I think prior outlook was 7.7 to 8.2, and now it\u2019s 7.8 to 7.9. And I think the press release indicates that most of it is just adjusting for missing revenue and earnings from the divestiture, but the composition sort of doesn\u2019t make sense. Can you tell us what the big moving pieces are as we move from 7.7, 8.2 range to 7.8 to 7.9.\nNick Gangestad: Andrew, there\u2019s a few moving pieces there. First of all, as you noted, now that we have divested of our communications markets division, there is some income that that would have been generating in the last seven months of the year that that will no longer be generating, and that\u2019s what's encompassed in our adjustment to our EPS guidance for the year. In particular, what you're talking about there, there is also an impact from net interest expense. So in terms of our earnings bridge that we laid out at the beginning of the year, there is a couple of moving parts in addition to this communication markets adjustment that we announced today. First is, we are buying back more shares, and we originally guided that that would be $0.10 to $0.15 of benefit. We now see ourselves at the high end of that range, so that\u2019s on the positive. We also are borrowing more money, so our net interest expense is going up. So we started the year guiding that net interest expense would be a benefit to our EPS of $0.05 to $0.10. We now think that will be approximately flat for the year.\nAndrew Obin: So these are the two moving pieces, and just a question going back to the ERP question. I assume your guidance is sort of incorporated. Did you guys anticipate this pre-buy in the second quarter? And the second, just how do you guys think about managing disruptions from ERP implementations in North America because Western Europe, and I do appreciate that Western Europe was a much more significant undertake in terms of shutting down facilities, moving stuff around, but you did have negative top line comps there for a while. So going to the second half, as you have to manage ERP disruptions in North America, what gives you confidence that there will not be hits to organic growth? How you guys are going to manage it?\nMike Roman: I would maybe start with, as we\u2019ve talked a lot about with the business transformation, it really starts and ends with the customer for us. So we are -- in our deployments, that's where we start. We focus on how to do the best for our customers, minimize impact and provide benefits with where we\u2019re going with business transformation. And I would say, as we deployed in Europe that was true. You are asking the customers to significantly change how they interact with us. But on the other side of that, change process is a lot of benefit for how we work together. And so I think we saw that in Europe. And we had the deployment and some of the same things we\u2019re seeing now in the U.S. where we had some repurchases. I don't think we would characterize it the way you did that we saw growth impacted by that business transformation. That was other dynamics in the marketplace and even some of things that we\u2019re doing around portfolio. So -- and maybe to a degree some of the things we\u2019re doing about some of the strategic investments there. But the layout with a focus on customers and how we manage that, that's part of what we're doing in the U.S. now. We\u2019re engaging day-in and day-out, communicating with them earlier about how this is progressing, working with them very closely about managing through any disruption as we scale down the legacy systems and scale up the new ERP and surrounding capabilities. And so that process, we are managing supply all the way through the calendar of those steps and this accelerated by -- we expected some accelerated by, we\u2019re working with our customers as we got closer, how much interruption would they see, how much accelerated buy made sense if -- and its really up to them. Ultimately, they\u2019re making the decision on what they buy based on the information we\u2019re communicating with them. I would say, it\u2019s in line with what we\u2019ve seen as we\u2019ve deployed through West Europe and I think it's projecting that. We\u2019re doing good job, the deployments are on track and progressing well.\nAndrew Obin: So from your perspective, there is high degree of visibility on organic growth in second half?\nMike Roman: Yes, related to the ERP deployment, absolutely.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: So there\u2019s obviously been a little more noise here with the ERP rollout. But can you give us a little more color and how should we think about your organic sales growth guidance by segment. If we look at your annual guidance and you guys talked about Health Care, at 4 to 6, maybe you\u2019re trending a little below there, but Safety and Graphics is trending way above. So is there a bit of trade-off there? And then the other segments generally in line for the year. Is that how we should think about it?\nNick Gangestad: Just a few things, as far as the impact of this ERP go-live impact and the way its impacting different segments in the U.S. We see these impacts primarily in our Industrial, Safety and Graphics, and Electronics and Energy business groups. It\u2019s not really having a material impact on consumer and really no impact on our healthcare business. So in terms of how you think about that impact in the second quarter and the third quarter, and fourth quarter it's really those three businesses that were impacted. Now in terms of our guidance for the year, we continue to see industrial globally -- we had originally guided 3% to 5%, we see that most likely in the bottom half of that range. And that aligns with the updated total company guidance that we providing in April. We do see Health Care probably closer to the 4% growth for the total year and safety and graphics, which we\u2019d originally guided at 4% to 6%, we see at the high end or possibly higher than the high end of our original guidance. The others are Consumer and Electronics and Energy, we see those solidly in the ranges that we that we first put out.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: And maybe I could ask you about pricing, obviously, very strong pricing in the quarter. When you look at price versus raws, it actually accelerated or was better in Q2 than Q1. I know you said it was going to be an elevated year for pricing. But are there any particular end markets where pricing is particularly strong? And then do you think the headwind on price versus raw material cost could be less than the $0.05 to $0.10 for the year that you updated this time last quarter?\nNick Gangestad: The $0.05 to $0.10, Andy, just to be clear, that\u2019s just the raw material headwind, that we updated that. And as far as price growth, it\u2019s actually, Andy, quite broad. I won\u2019t point out one business, or one geography, as really driving these results it's really quite broad and deep where the price growth is. In terms of impact on margin, I think I said earlier that we continue to see that positive for the year and halfway through the year. We continue to see that highly confident that our price increases will more than offset whatever we see for raw material headwinds for the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell: In terms of -- maybe first question on the top of the end market. Any updated thoughts on the automotive outlook, particularly in your Industrial business? And also within Electronics and Energy, there had been this bifurcation earlier in the year where device sell-through was soft but the CapEx or electronics materials business was very strong. Just wondered how you\u2019ve seen that playing out more recently. And are you worried about the CapEx portion or EMS decelerating given what's happening with the device sell-through?\nMike Roman: So starting with the automotive, we continued, as year-to-date through the first half, we continue to see strong growth relative to the build rates globally. So remember we\u2019re managing a global automotive business, focus around key account relationships with the OEMs globally. And we\u2019re seeing continued good performance on our spec-ins and penetration into the marketplace and so good growth, year-to-date relative to the build rates. Some improvement in the build rates in second quarter still looking at IHS projections, up over 4%, slightly over 4% second quarter; again, total year still in line with that, 2.2% number; and always watching quarter-to-quarter the ups and downs there; but are performing well; and when you bring together our automotive electrification capabilities and what we're doing in our technology and applications around that, we continue to see a very robust outlook for outgrowing the build rates. If you turn to Electronics and Energy, we continue to see, I would say, strong growth in what we've been talking about as high growth electronic segments, around automotive electrification, around data centers, semiconductor fabrication, that continues to move forward; and semiconductor fabrication behind, as part of your question there where CapEx is being spent, still seeing significant growth opportunities for us. The rest of the electronics, I would say, electronics in general is playing out in line with the way we laid it out at the beginning of the year that was the more, I would say, modest growth in the consumer electronics part of our portfolio and stronger growth in those higher growth segments. There is some, I would say, some shifts here or there in the quarter but pretty much playing out as we expected in our Electronics and Energy business, pretty much right down the middle of the range that we laid out at the beginning of the year as well.\nJulian Mitchell: And then my second question would just be around, if you look back your EPS road map from Slide 8, way back at the December outlook meeting from Nick\u2019s presentation. I think you\u2019ve given the very thorough update on two of the laying chunks in that, so maybe any thought on the productivity piece. How that's trending in terms of footprint optimization, business transformation and the manufacturing productivity? In terms of -- I guess, what are the savings -- how the savings from those various programs tracking in the first half versus what you would expected? And any gyrations in the sales line causing you to accelerate some of the productivity plans?\nNick Gangestad: Julian, in terms of the 2018 roadmap that I provided last December and then we updated it in January after tax reform, the other components are staying where we expected. But let me give a little color on it. Even organic growth, with the roll-down that we had in our total year organic growth expectation for the year, we see more of our growth coming from price, which is accretive to EPS. So our organic growth impact on earnings remains unchanged; footprint optimization, much of that, Julian, was just not repeating the charges that we took in 2017. There\u2019s some incremental charges and some benefit, those largely washed in 2018. We\u2019re expecting the majority of true benefit to be coming in 2019 and 2020. So that is progressing exactly as we expected. Raw materials, as I noted, we adjusted that down from that original guidance. Business transformation and productivity, both of those are tracking to the range that we put in that they\u2019re performing exactly as we expected.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: I\u2019d like to follow up on some of the business line specific questions that Julian started there. And Mike, can you address how auto aftermarket did in the quarter versus some of the follow up we saw in the first quarter? And then in oral care, we saw the total growth. How did the U.S. market do specifically, has the distribution channel calm down and maybe talk a bit more about this launch. It looks that like Clarity will compete directly with Invisalign. And is that -- what are the competitive dynamics there?\nMike Roman: So starting with the industrial, automotive aftermarket question, Industrial, we saw broad-based growth across all geographic areas of all businesses. We highlighted some of the leading growth there. We saw mid-single-digit growth in our automotive aftermarket business in Q2. Coming out of Q1, we\u2019re really looking hard at the market. We saw end demand soften as we came out of Q1, but the total year was projecting nominal growth for that marketplace. And we expected to improve as we went through the year, and we saw that starts in Q2. We saw the demand pick up. We saw our opportunity to marketplace pick up across developed economies, in particular, in the U.S. leading that. So we saw the improvement we expected with automotive aftermarket, and we\u2019re projecting the total year in line with where we started at the beginning. Turning to oral care, oral care is an important business for us. We\u2019re recognized as a leader in number of positions, leveraging our material science. And we continue to innovate and look to invest and grow this business as we move ahead. It really does leverage our strengths. If you look at the overall growth in second quarter; 3% for worldwide growth, down slightly in the U.S.; improving over Q1 and again, what we're expecting is to see some improvement globally; and led again by developing markets, but improving as we go through the year; still some room to go in improvement in the U.S. as we move ahead. We did announced and introduced our Clarity aligners at the American Association Orthodontist Show in May. And we believe that this now positions us to have the broadest set of solutions across orthodontic platforms, and we\u2019re actively onboarding orthodontist right now. So it\u2019s really a play for us to help -- have a broad-based suite of solutions for the orthodontists in the global market. We\u2019re getting -- so far getting very good and positive feedback.\nDeane Dray: And just as a follow up on tariffs, and maybe Nick can clarify the points that expect to be positive in price cost. Does that include the tariffs that have been announced and enacted? And what\u2019s the look forward on potential risk as this may get escalated?\nNick Gangestad: The guidance that I said is inclusive of tariffs that have been enacted. So when we\u2019re talking tariffs there\u2019s a number of tariffs, first, the steel and aluminum under the national security act. And that impact as well as the Section 301 list 1, those two that have already been enacted, we see having a fairly immaterial impact on us. So we estimate that to be approximately $10 million, or a penny of share on an annualized basis, the direct and indirect impact of those tariffs. We are actively monitoring and assessing the potential impact from Section 301 list 2 and 3, if those were implemented and any potential retaliation that could occur with those. And we\u2019re prepared to act with sourcing changes, supply changes and pricing changes if enacted. So my initial statement stands that we think pricing will offset raw material impacts there and if tariffs expand we continue to see that happening. We\u2019re not quantifying the impact of those latter two since they haven\u2019t been enacted yet, but we are prepared with actions to minimize the impact of that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed.\nLaurence Alexander: Two quick ones, first, on the price versus raws dynamic. If raw material pressures peak out, do you think you can maintain the same pace of price, or is there certain amount of the price mix just the raw material offsets. And secondly on Asia, specifically in China, can you parse out a little bit the trends driving the pick-up in Chinese growth -- the acceleration from Q1 to Q2? Is that just Consumer and Health or is there something else going on there?\nNick Gangestad: Laurence, on the price raw materials, we are likely seeing that our commodity prices and the increases we\u2019re seeing there likely at a peak level. And our pricing projections, our selling price projections are consistent with that and that\u2019s part of our anticipation that in a more stable world going forward with commodities, we\u2019ll continue to have our prices -- our selling price increases more than offset what we\u2019re estimating now for commodity price increases. And we really don't see that changing. And if the commodity prices start to change again, we will be prepared to act.\nMike Roman: And Laurence, just taking a look at China, we had strong growth in second quarter. Electronics performed very well as we continue to, I would say, win business with companies based there, including the China OEMs. We also saw strong growth in our domestic facing businesses, the domestic economy facing businesses. We\u2019ve had a strategy to prioritize growth here in line with what China is doing to develop their economy. And so as you noted, Health Care is a strong leader of that growth in the first half of the year, big part of our consumer business performing very well. Safety and Graphics also, really with the domestic facing portfolio, doing well. And even if you look at our Industrial business, we have platform businesses -- our Industrial business group that are performing well too and that would be a good example our industrial adhesives and tapes business doing very well in China. So it's broader than just Health Care and Consumer, really centered around where the growth is occurring in the broader China market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nNigel Coe: The $0.15 probably mix of restructuring associated with the gain on the comms business. Is that just to the E&E comm segments or is this broader, and maybe just some color in terms of what actions you\u2019re taking with the $0.15?\nNick Gangestad: Nigel, the actions that we\u2019re taking are to address stranded costs that are left after the divestiture of our CMD business. So there\u2019re addressing structural costs that this divestiture is leaving. We started those actions in Q2 and we expect to take more in the second half of the year to offset what could have been a negative impact if we had left those stranded costs in the company going forward.\nNigel Coe: And would that be a payback, relatively quick payback, 12 month payback or little bit longer?\nNick Gangestad: We expect that that will be paying back for us next year. Some of those actions will trail into next year in terms of when the cost saving start to happen. But we\u2019ll be starting to see that benefit in 2019. And Nigel, one other thing I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re asking this earlier, this charge is almost entirely been taken at a corporate level and not in our Electronics and Energy business.\nNigel Coe: And then just a follow on question, on the guidance, the way the guidance set up at the second half. Are we getting questions in terms of still somewhat backend loaded, particularly when we think about the way the FX is coming through the P&L and if those comms comes at first half and second half. What\u2019s better in the second half versus the first half to get us to the midpoint of the guidance range>\nNick Gangestad: For the second half of the year, we do expect that we\u2019ll be seeing more benefit from share repurchases than we saw in the first half. We do think productivity will be better in the second half than what we saw in the first half. And then in terms of commodity prices from a year-on-year basis, we expect that that will be fairly neutral between the first half and the second half. Pricing will likely be better in the second half than in the first half.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Sprague: Just a quick clean up from me on healthcare and then maybe a bigger picture question for Mike. Health Care U.S. growth has been a little on the soft side year-to-date and in the quarter, perhaps it's dental. But are we observing some hangover from pull forward on sales there from ERP last year in the healthcare business?\nMike Roman: Jeff, healthcare in the U.S. where you\u2019re seeing the impact, broadly, we had strong growth and our medical solutions business is leading the way there. So maybe just a note about that too, we've been talking about this as our medical consumables business in the past, but it really is focused on value-based care and health economics. And it's a much -- in more integrated portfolio around that. So I\u2019m going to be talking about as medical solutions, so leading the way. We saw good growth in the U.S., also in food safety and health information. Oral care was down slightly. The bigger drag in second quarter was our drug delivery business. Again, we talked about project based business. We saw a decline in Q2 from that business and that was the bigger impact, so broad-based stronger growth that will position us well in the U.S. and as we move ahead. And then you asked\u2026\nJeff Sprague: And then, Mike, on the portfolio. Obviously, you\u2019ve been working closely with Inge all along. And I guess things will always be under review. But was CMD out of the way here now, do you view the portfolio as relatively stable, or there is more that you're working on internally and want to reevaluate?\nMike Roman: If you look at where we are focused as we move ahead, our playbook is working. Our playbook is working, but there are opportunities that each of those three levers, including portfolio management. We are now an active portfolio manager and we do have a robust pipeline of how we look at our portfolio. And we\u2019ll be working to best utilize the 3M model and optimize the portfolio around our model for value creation. So we\u2019re going to continue to be an active portfolio manager as we move ahead. It's about prioritizing resources. It's about targeting where we go with M&A. And it's also about reviewing our businesses as we go. So I see that as very much part of our future value creation opportunity. And it's a priority for me as I step into the role.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Winoker: I just want to dig a little bit more into that important price point, the 1.1% in the quarter. You mentioned it was quite broad. But you usually also talk about splitting out currency impacts and other impacts versus underlying business year-on-year relative to taking pricing on existing items and new product, some time driving a big part of it. I am just trying to get a sense for the operating robustness of that number and the repeatability of it as we\u2019re looking through not only if implying the rest of the year, but later into next year too?\nNick Gangestad: Steven, as I said, it\u2019s broad based; 100 basis points up in the U.S.; EMEA was up 180 basis points; Latin America and Canada 210 basis points; and A-Pac up 40 basis points. And that 110 basis points is inclusive of our electronics business, which is normally a price down model. If we pull electronics out, our underlying price growth was up 130 basis points. And as far as geographies and what we see as potential there, we continue to see -- we don\u2019t see that going down. Part of your question, Steve, was also on FX impact. Right now, we estimate there was only about 20 of that 110 or 130, depending on how you look at, price growth that was coming from FX. The vast majority of it is coming from core underlying price growth. And it's really a reflection of the value we create for our customers. And this is the new point I\u2019m making here. It\u2019s partially being driven by improvements in our global price management that our business transformation initiative is enabling. The ability to have better governance and better control over that pricing, we are starting to see that benefit and that\u2019s part of what you\u2019re seeing change here.\nSteven Winoker: And Mike, Jeff just referred to it on the divestiture side and the portfolio change side. But looking at acquisition, Scott Safety was a great strategic play for you guys. What are you seeing in terms of think of the pipeline right now? Should we be expecting anything in the bigger size range soon, or are things on hold at all as you\u2019re going through the transition. What should the expectations be on the acquisitions?\nMike Roman: For ne coming in, as always, organic growth remains our first priority. And so we\u2019re going to continue to prioritize investments in R&D, CapEx and product commercialization. With that in mind though in managing our portfolio, we\u2019re looking at M&A as an opportunity to create value, we\u2019re going to maintain the flexibility to pursue additional strategic acquisition opportunities like Scott Safety. And we have been, I think, very clearly focused on strategies that leverage our fundamental strengths unique value creators to 3M. Our ability to integrate successfully these acquisitions and to create market leadership positions like we've been doing in personal safety. So we are active. Our top priorities, as I look ahead our Health Care and Industrial, Safety and Graphics continues to be a priority, those are very much focused on integrating Scott Safety at this time. With that said, all five businesses are active. And we have strong overall pipelines for us to work with. And so for me it's about really moving ahead and identifying those opportunities that are clearly linked to those strategies where we can create differentiated value.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Tusa: So just better understanding some of the moving parts here, back to Nigel's question on the seasonality. You pulled forward a bit of sales here in the second quarter. You got pretty though comp in the third quarter. Anything on that comp that we should be aware of, is it like second half looks like first half whereas first quarter was lower than second quarter, a 3% range. Is that how we\u2019re thinking about the second half split between 3Q and Q4 on organic? And then also just on EPS, you had a low tax rate, tax rate low end of the range this quarter, maybe that steps up a little bit in the third quarter. Will you grow earnings here sequentially in the third quarter?\nNick Gangestad: Steve, in terms of growth, let me give some guidance on how we're seeing growth between the third and fourth quarter. Mike talked earlier about the impact of our U.S. go-live with our ERP system and the amount of the revenue. So that impact as we expect that to be -- us to be giving back some of the sales in the second half of the year, we expect that to disproportionately impact the third quarter. And as you noted between the two quarters, Q3 is the tougher of the two comps between the third and the fourth quarter. That all-in, we are looking at the third quarter being lower growth than the fourth quarter, both of them aligned with our expectation of 3 to 4 for the total year. But I'm not going to be surprised if we have a lower number in third quarter, given what we're seeing so far for the year, and it\u2019s in line with our 3% to 4% guidance. And then in terms of EPS for each quarter, I\u2019ll try to avoid giving EPS guidance on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But we continue to see ourselves very firmly delivering in that 10 on an adjusted basis to 10.20 to the 10.45 for the total year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Aguilar of Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.\nJoshua Aguilar: So drug delivery down low single digits year-over-year, and I think last quarter was the same case of tough comps. Obviously, this is more project-based businesses as you guys said. And I remember in your Investor Day in 2016 you were talking about some of the advantages from drug delivery, like analytics and patient compliance. More long term, are you guys still optimistic about the future trends there generally with drug delivery? And can you give us an update about what you're excited about?\nMike Roman: Josh, you\u2019re referring to some of the opportunities that we see for growth in that business. And we see opportunities to take that business to a positive growth business as we move ahead. It will continue to be a project-based business. So quarter-to-quarter, it can be lumpy and up and down but we do see opportunities. We have some unique capabilities and technology there that we imply as we move ahead.\nOperator: That concludes the question and answer portion of our conference call. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.\nMike Roman: To wrap up, we had a strong performance in the second quarter, led by broad-based organic growth, expanded margins and a double-digit increase in earnings per share. We are executing our playbook and are positioned to deliver successful 2018. Thank you again for joining us this morning, and have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentleman, that does conclude the conference call for today, we thank you for your participation.

Welcome to the 3M First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, April 24, 2018. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2018 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO; Mike Roman, our Chief Operating Officer; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Inge and Nick will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our upcoming investor events in 2018 found on Slide 2. Please mark your calendars for our upcoming earnings calls on July 24 and October 23. Also, we have established a date for our next Investor Day, which will be held at our headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota on Thursday, November 15. More details will be available as we get closer to the event. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note that throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in particular, measures which exclude the impact of the measurement adjustment for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the previously disclosed legal settlement with the State of Minnesota. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of today's presentation and press release. Lastly, we filed a Form 8-K on March 15, updating our business segment reporting for dual credit and reflecting the adoption of the new financial accounting standard relative to pension and post-retirement benefit cost. Both of these updates are reflected in our reported results and on a historical basis starting this quarter. Please turn to Slide 4, and I'll hand off to Inge. Inge?\nInge Thulin: Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Coming off a strong 2017, our team opened the new year with broad-based organic growth across all business groups. We expanded margins and posted a double-digit increase in earnings per share while continuing to invest in our business and return cash to our shareholders. Looking at the first quarter numbers, we deliver earnings of $2.50 per share, a 16% increase year-on-year. Total sales rose to $8.3 billion, which is an all-time high for our enterprise. Company-wide, organic growth was 3%. Three of our business groups, Safety and Graphics, Electronics and Energy and Consumer, all posted good growth that was within or above their expected full year ranges. Safety and Graphics delivered another robust performance with 7% organic growth, coming off 6% growth in 2017. As you know, we have significantly adjusted the Safety and Graphics portfolio over the last several years, and those actions continued to pay off in terms of improved growth and margins. Electronics and Energy posted 2% growth in the quarter with strong growth in data center and semiconductor markets. Within this business group, we have also adjusted the portfolio in recent years, and we now see, in addition to growth, continued and sustained improvements in margins. Consumer also delivered 2% organic growth, its fourth straight quarter of positive growth, with particular strengths in our home improvement business. Our Health Care and Industrial Business Groups, which grew 3% and 2%, respectively, each had many areas of strengths but also few areas of softness that temper overall growth. Within Health Care, we delivered good growth in medical consumables, health information systems and food safety. We saw flat growth in oral care and sales in drug delivery were down against a tough comparison. Turning to our Industrial Business Group. Industrial opened the year with 2% growth with good performance in abrasives and industrial adhesives and tapes. Automotive OEM business also grew well and once again outperformed global auto builds despite negative build rates for the total automotive industry. Finally, growth in our automotive aftermarket business was softer than we anticipated going into the year. Looking at our entire company's performance from a geographical perspective, we continue to capitalize on opportunities in developing markets. In Q1, we posted 7% growth in developing markets, including double-digit growth in China, along with strong growth in India, Southeast Asia and Brazil. Turning to margins. Our team expanded margins to a healthy 23% with 4 of our 5 business groups at 23% or higher. We also continued to build for the future, including investing 10% of sales into the combination of research and development and CapEx while returning significant cash to our shareholders. In the quarter, we returned $1.7 billion to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. And as a reminder, we increased our Q1 dividend by 16%, which marks 60 consecutive years of dividend increases. In summary, we delivered good growth in the quarter throughout much of the portfolio while a few markets were softer than we anticipated going into the year. As a result, today, we're adjusting the top end of our full year guidance for organic growth and earnings per share. We expect organic growth of 3% to 4% versus 3% to 5% previously, along with EPS of $10.20 to $10.55 against the prior range of $10.20 to $10.70. Going forward, we remain confident in our ability to keep generating premium value for our customers and premium returns for our shareholders. We will continue to execute the 3M playbook and strengthen our competitiveness and are well positioned to deliver strong results in 2018 and beyond. With that, I will turn the call over to Nick, who would take you through the details. Nick?\nNicholas Gangestad: Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. Let me begin with two topics that impacted GAAP earnings in the first quarter that Bruce touched on at the beginning of the call. Recall that following the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we recorded a provisional tax expense in Q4. As expected, the IRS has issued subsequent guidance resulting in updates to these amounts. As a result, we booked an additional tax expense of $270 million or $0.36 per share in the first quarter. We expect further IRS updates throughout the year. Also, we incurred an $897 million charge for the legal settlement which amounted to a $1.16 impact to earnings per share. This charge is reflected within Corporate and Unallocated. Excluding these impacts, first quarter earnings were $2.50 per share, an increase of 16% year-on-year. Please note that the balance of my prepared remarks today will exclude the impact of both items on 2018 earnings. Please turn to Slide 6 to review first quarter sales. Sales growth in the first quarter was 2.8% organically. Selling prices increased 70 basis points in the first quarter. Excluding our electronics businesses, selling prices were up 90 basis points and were positive across all geographic areas. This marks our strongest underlying price performance in several years. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures contributed 70 basis points to growth in the quarter. In addition, foreign currency translation increased sales by 4.2 percentage points. All in, first quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 7.7% versus last year. In the U.S., organic growth was 2.3% with selling prices up 80 basis points. Growth was led by Safety and Graphics and Consumer. EMEA was flat in Q1 with West Europe down 1%. Asia Pacific delivered mid-single-digit organic growth, led by Safety and Graphics and Health Care. Organic growth was 11% in China/Hong Kong. Japan was flat or up 3%, excluding electronics. Finally, Q1 organic growth in Latin America/Canada was 3.5%, led by Health Care and Safety and Graphics. At a country level, Canada and Brazil delivered organic growth of 5%, while Mexico was up 3%. Please turn to Slide 7 for the first quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide first quarter sales were $8.3 billion with operating income of $1.9 billion, up 9.3%. First quarter operating margins were 23%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. Let's take a closer look at the components of our margin performance in the first quarter. Leverage on organic growth, productivity and lower year-on-year performance and footprint actions contributed a combined 120 basis points to margins. Acquisitions net of divestitures reduced margins by 40 basis points. Selling price benefits more than offset raw material inflation, adding 10 basis points to operating margins. Foreign currency net of hedging impacts reduced margins by 40 basis points, and higher retirement benefit cost decreased operating margins by 20 basis points. Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at earnings-per-share. First quarter earnings were $2.50 per share, up 16% year-over-year. The benefits of organic growth, productivity and lower year-on-year portfolio and footprint actions added a combined $0.17 to per share earnings in the quarter. Foreign currency impacts net of hedging added $0.05 a share. Other expenses decreased earnings by $0.07 per share due to higher year-on-year net interest expense and retirement expense. Our underlying Q1 tax rate was 17.6%, in line with our expectations, which increased earnings by $0.18 per share. The lower tax rate was driven by tax reform and continued benefits from our supply chain centers of expertise. Please turn to Slide 9 for a look at our cash flow performance. First quarter free cash flow was a minus $161 million, impacted by the legal settlement that I referred to earlier. The net impact from the legal settlement and tax reform adjustment decreased free cash flow conversion by 72 percentage points. First quarter capital expenditures were $304 million, up $17 million year-on-year. For the full year, we continue to anticipate CapEx investments in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. As Inge mentioned earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 16%, resulting in $810 million in cash dividends paid to shareholders during the quarter. We also returned $937 million to shareholders through growth share repurchases. With this in mind, we are increasing our full year range to $3 billion to $5 billion versus $2 billion to $5 billion previously. Let's now review our business group performance, starting with Industrial on Slide 10. The Industrial Business Group delivered first quarter sales of $3.1 billion, up 2.2% organically. Within Industrial, growth was led by abrasives, up mid-single digits, and industrial adhesives and tapes, up 3%. Our automotive OEM business was up over 3%, outpacing growth in global car and light truck builds by over 400 basis points. In automotive aftermarket, we saw good growth in our products and solutions for retail car care, which was more than offset by softer demand from auto body shops. On a geographic basis, Industrial's organic growth was led by a 5% increase in Asia Pacific, followed by a low single-digit growth in both Latin America/Canada and the United States. Industrial delivered first quarter operating income of $719 million, up 7.3%, with an operating margin of 22.9%. Please turn to Slide 11. First quarter Safety and Graphics sales were up 6.9% organically to $1.8 billion with growth across all businesses and geographies. Our Personal Safety business continued to post excellent growth, up double digits in the quarter. This business continues to see strong global demand for our personal protective equipment across all end markets. The commercial solutions and roofing granules businesses were both up mid-single digits. Transportation safety also posted positive growth, driven by our core sheeting and pavement marking segments. In addition, this business recently won contracts with the State of California to upgrade their infrastructure and enable the roadway of the future. Geographically, organic growth was led by high single-digit increases in both Asia Pacific and the U.S. with mid-single-digit growth in both EMEA and Latin America/Canada. Operating income was $483 million and operating margins of 27.1%, up 140 basis points year-on-year. Please turn to Slide 12. Our Health Care business generated first quarter sales of $1.5 billion, up 2.7% organically. Growth was led by a high single-digit increase in both food safety and health information systems. Our medical consumables business, which represents the largest segment within Health Care, posted mid-single-digit growth in Q1. Oral care was flat with continued good growth internationally, particularly in developing economies, offset by softness in the U.S. On a geographic basis, Asia Pacific led the way, up 8%, followed by 5% growth in Latin America/Canada. We saw continued strength in developing markets, which were up 10% in the quarter, led by China/Hong Kong and Brazil. Health Care's first quarter operating income increased 7% to $460 million, and operating margins were nearly 30%. Next, let's cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 13. Electronics and Energy organic sales growth was 1.7% in the first quarter. Sales were $1.4 billion. The electronics side of the business grew 3% organically, including low double-digit growth in electronics materials solutions. Growth continues to be very strong in semiconductor manufacturing and data centers, with robust demand for cooling fluids and interconnect solutions. Partially offsetting this growth was a decline in display materials and systems due to softness in consumer electronics. Our energy-related businesses were down low single digits organically with electrical markets flat and telecommunications down. Please note, we continue to expect to close on the sale of our telecommunications business later this year. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by a 4% increase in Asia Pacific. First quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $337 million with operating margins of 24.9%. Please turn to Slide 14. First quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion and organic growth was 2.1% year-on-year. Our home improvement business grew high single digits organically, building on its track record of strong performance over the past several years. Home care also delivered positive growth in the quarter while consumer health care declined. Looking at Consumer geographically, growth was led by a 4% increase in the U.S. followed by 3% growth in Latin America/Canada. We continue to invest and expand our category-leading brands, such as Filtrete and Post-it. During Q1, we launched the first-ever Bluetooth-enabled Filtrete Smart Air Filter. We also launched Post-it Extreme Notes, which are designed to hold to rough surfaces even in challenging conditions. Finally, operating income was $218 million with operating margins at 19.3%. Operating margins were impacted by year-over-year portfolio and footprint actions, along with the investments associated with the new product launches I previously mentioned. For the year, we expect margins to be in the low 20s, similar to 2017. That wraps up our review of first quarter results. Please turn to Slide 15, and I'll review our updated 2018 guidance. As Inge summarized in his opening remarks, we are updating our full year organic growth expectation to a range of 3% to 4% versus previous guidance of 3% to 5%. With respect to earnings, we now expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $10.20 to $10.55 versus a prior range of $10.20 to $10.70. Our full-year expectations for return on invested capital and free cash flow conversion remain unchanged. With that, we thank you for your attention and we'll now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Is this Inge's last call that he's hosting before he becomes Chairman, the special new job thingie?\nInge Thulin: No, it's not. I would be in July as well, and I own the next quarter as well, so I'm not going away.\nScott Davis: Well, good. Well, we're glad to keep you or have you still around. But anyways, I've got 2 questions and one just on the business and one really on succession. But first, on the business, electronics, is price decelerating in electronics? Is there some sort of change in supply dynamic or supply-demand dynamic? Or is it on the same, really, curve that's been on now for several years?\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes, Scott. What seeing in price in the Electronics and Energy business, I'd say there's no discernible trend of it getting better or worse. It's typically a slight decline in price as we compete on the electronics side of the business. We've been seeing that and we continue to expect that going forward, but not a trend of it accelerating down nor accelerating up. It's pretty constant, Scott.\nScott Davis: Right. And just as a follow-on, I mean, what -- Inge, what has Mike Roman been working on? I mean, what's the focus? Any early read on CEO transition of what might change or difference?\nInge Thulin: Yes, Mike is here, so he will give some comments around that. But yes, a couple of comments. The transition is going very well. Mike, first of all, we have worked together for many years, as you know. First time we worked together was back in Europe early 2000, so I think 2003 and so. And then Mike was also working with me on the strategies that were laid out in 2012 and 2013. And currently, we talk every day. I feel like we text every hour and are totally aligned to what needs to be done. But he's here, so he should make some comments relative to his initial thought and so forth. But most importantly, he is very much focused on delivering Q2 together with all of us and of course, also what we did in Q1. So Mike, if you like to add some comment on...\nMichael Roman: Yes. Scott, that's where I would start to. I'm focused on delivering 2018 starting with Q2 now. So over those 15 years, I really enjoyed working with Inge. Especially the last six years, I've been proud to be part of his leadership team that has helped advance the company. And I -- we've accomplished a lot under his leadership. And so I would say what I focus on is the things that we've been building and really, where we have a lot of similarities, and our focus is on our playbook. And the commitment to that playbook, including the opportunities we have in Portfolio Management and the innovation in Business Transformation as we move ahead. So that's where the focus is right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with UBS.\nSteven Winoker: Just wanted to make sure I understood the reduction at the high end of guidance. Is that whole $0.15 just sort of high incrementals on the 1% reduction at the high end?\nMichael Roman: Yes, Steve. The EPS change in guidance really is a result of what we're doing on the adjustment to our outlook for organic growth and really making that adjustment from 3% to 5% to 3% to 4% and doing that, really focused on those businesses and markets where we saw some of the specific market softness as we came through Q1.\nSteven Winoker: Okay. And that market softness mostly -- in this discussion, what I heard, sounds like -- maybe a little more clarity around Western Europe, what's going on there in terms of what you're seeing on the short cycle side.\nMichael Roman: Yes. If you look at West Europe, organic growth came in as expected. And I would say -- come back to what we talked about in the past, that we're taking portfolio and footprint actions in West Europe to improve our growth in margins. And we're going to continue to do that. It's our part of our plan and our focus on delivering on that 20% income margin by 2020, and so that's built in. We still see West Europe tracking with our expectations to be low single digits.\nSteven Winoker: Okay. And then in that case, just broadly speaking, the weakest organic growth on the short cycle basis that you saw globally, can you just nail that down for us?\nMichael Roman: Well, I think we called out several specific markets. So automotive aftermarket, oral care and I would say, our consumer electronics is tracking as we expected as we come into the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.\nJoseph Ritchie: Can we maybe talk on the organic growth guidance, the step-down to 3% to 4%.? We spent some time together in March. It still seems like the higher end of the range was going to be achievable for the year. So I'm just wondering, if -- from a near-term perspective, have things changed at all? Have things gotten off to a little bit of a slower start than originally expected in April?\nMichael Roman: Joe, I would tell you, back to March, we started to see the softness in Q1 coming through as we went through the month and we signaled that. And it was -- even at that point, it was specific to the market segments that we called out, and those played out as we thought they would through March. If you look at April, April is starting in line with our expectations. And so I think that the adjustment to the range was really looking to those specific markets that we saw coming through Q1, and we expect to see some improvement in a couple of those areas, but it's really -- that's what's driving the adjustment.\nJoseph Ritchie: Okay, fair enough. If I were to maybe just touch on price costs for just a second. So clearly, pricing is coming through a little bit better than expected. But also, from a cost inflation standpoint, it seems like it's a little bit more difficult this year to try to offset with substitute products. Maybe just an update on the expectations for the year for both pricing and also on the cost inflation side.\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes, Joe. You're picking up on those two points accurately. We see ourselves as off to a good start with our selling prices with it up 70 basis points and positive across all geographies. And for the year, we expect price growth to remain strong and that it will more than offset raw material inflation. But to that end, on raw material inflation, we are seeing more -- some increases in raw material prices. In fact, more than what we originally estimated when we gave the guidance back in December is particularly around crude derivatives and transportation and logistics expenses. For the year, we're still expecting our stronger price growth to more than offset the raw materials. And if you think back to the guidance that we set out for raw materials, and this may answer a little bit of Steve's earlier question too, we started the year expecting raw materials, commodity prices to be about a push, somewhere between a $0.05 benefit to a $0.05 headwind, depending on -- net of the projects that we do to offset that. Right now, we see that's somewhere between a $0.05 to $0.10 headwind. So that's part of what we're seeing impacting our earnings for the year. But that's being more than offset by the higher pricing that we're now also expecting for the year.\nJoseph Ritchie: That's helpful, Nick. Maybe just one clarification there, there's a new like kind of $0.05 to $0.10 range from a headwind perspective. Does that include the increased freight cost as well?\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes, it does.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa of JPMorgan Securities.\nCharles Tusa: So could you give us maybe a little bit of color on how the -- how we're going to trend kind of over the course of the year from a growth perspective? I know that you had the Easter timing here in the first quarter you had called out before. How does that play into the second quarter? And then how do we -- is there any lumpiness or volatility in growth in the second half as well around the third and the fourth quarter, just high level?\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes. Steve, as I look out over the rest of the year, April, we're seeing off to a strong and expected start for us. So as I look at the 3 remaining quarters of the year, I don't really see any discernible trend difference amongst those 3. All of them coming in, in line now with our expected 3% to 4% organic growth for the year. I don't really see any lumpiness there.\nCharles Tusa: Okay. Is there anything that you think abnormally impacted the seasonality in the first quarter here? Maybe your -- I mean, the price costs are still kind of neutral-ish, so I wouldn't think it would be price cost. But anything in the quarter here that depresses the result from a seasonal perspective?\nNicholas Gangestad: Other than the one thing we mentioned with the timing of Easter, that's -- as far as anything else seasonal, I don't think we see anything like that, Steve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: So in Health Care, growth has been soft over the last couple of quarters, but maybe a little below expectations. You mentioned oral care, obviously, has been -- it was flat, a little weaker than the last couple of quarters. You did seem to outperform in oral care last year, but kind of improved this year. What could get better in Health Care to reaccelerate as the year goes on? We know your long-term expectations for Health Care growth are above the high 2% range that you reported in the quarter.\nMichael Roman: Yes. Thank you, Andy. You look at Health Care, we had good growth in our medical consumables business, our food safety, our health information systems businesses, and we expect that trend to continue as we go through the year. Oral care was flat. We did see good growth internationally, especially in developing economies, but that was offset by some softness in the U.S. So if you look at that playing out, we expect to see some improvement there. But that is what's pulling down the organic growth in the first quarter. And we also -- our drug delivery business, as you know, was a project-based business and that can be up and down quarter-to-quarter and we saw Q1 down year-on-year against a strong comp that we had last year. So those -- was maybe more of a first quarter issue, but oral care flat was the real focus.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Okay. And then maybe just shifting to Industrial. There, you did have a relatively strong momentum in the second half of the year. You talked auto aftermarket [indiscernible]. What's interesting obviously is you also mentioned last -- whether  you're pulling that on rebates in Industrial. And obviously, you've had good pricing growth. Do you think that's had anything to do with sort of the slowing in Industrial, having maybe overpriced at all in Industrial? And how do you look at it sort of going forward?\nMichael Roman: Yes. As you heard, we had good growth in abrasives and industrial adhesives and tapes and in auto OEM over build rates. And all of those were part of that price performance as well. So I think that's a broad part of our portfolio, and that didn't see any volume fall off because of price. In automotive aftermarket, which was the decline in Q1, we saw strong growth in our products and solutions for retail. Car care was really the declines in auto body, and so it was a very specific market. And we saw no indications of a pull-in ahead of any price increases and really no changes. It was just a soft market for us as we went through that quarter. So it was really that. So I think we continue to see strong growth across the broader industrial portfolio.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Okay. And you don't think it's share loss or anything like that in auto aftermarket?\nMichael Roman: No, we don't see any indication of that at all, Andy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob McCarthy of Stifel, Nicolaus & Company.\nRobert McCarthy: I think following up on Andy's line of questioning. Obviously, you got some decent price to the U.S. Definitely, 1Q, I think, was up slight -- '18, plus 80 basis points there. But you did see some weakness, I mean -- and if you think about your overall kind of formula for leveraging global IPI and having some decent strength in the U.S., do you think it's fair to say you under indexed the U.S.? And don't you think it raises some questions at maybe some parts of your product portfolio, you might be facing some level of commoditization in Consumer and some consumer health care? And how do you react to that aside from probably defiance?\nMichael Roman: So Rob, again, I go back to -- we do see broad growth relative to those markets and overall economic backdrop. And so I think it's really isolated to specific market segments, and that's what we're seeing in the U.S. right now. And it's really been -- when you look broadly across the portfolio in the U.S., it's automotive aftermarkets, it's oral care and it's a couple of project-based businesses. We have some year-over-year comps with a couple of project-based businesses. Those are not price value kinds of changes.\nRobert McCarthy: And then just maybe coming out a different way. Obviously, your gross margin contracted year-over-year by about 60 basis points. Is there any kind of narrative there you can kind of give us in terms of mix, price costs? What's going on there that's become the main driver if you look at Slide 19 in terms of your Q on a -- P&L on a consolidated basis?\nNicholas Gangestad: Rob, one of the bigger things in there that you may not be seeing visibility to is what FX is doing to our gross margin. Clearly, we get some benefit to our earnings per share from a weaker U.S. dollar, but that's partially offset by our hedging strategy that offsets some of our risk from FX. All of those hedging losses become part of our cost of goods sold. And that brought down gross margin in 20 -- in the first quarter of 2018 as well as bringing down operating margin by 40 basis points.\nRobert McCarthy: Should we think about that currency translation drop through kind of like low teens, like a 10% drop through by definition of the rolling of the hedges and structurally? Or how do we think about the incremental margin coming from FX growth?\nNicholas Gangestad: The incremental margin, Rob, I haven't quite thought of it in that direction. Generally, what...\nRobert McCarthy: Sorry, the drop through from FX to the bottom line.\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes, it will vary depending where we are in the cycle with FX movements. Right now, we're at a point where we're going against a comp a year ago where we were having hedging gains. Now we're having hedging losses with the weaker U.S. dollar. So I can't put out one metric like that because it will vary quarter-to-quarter.\nRobert McCarthy: Well, like traffic and oversimplification.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Just in terms of geographies, the China strength was impressive, up double digits. Maybe give us a context about the end market drivers or the product drivers there. And part of the issue here, maybe this is just an overhang with all the headline news about trade war and protectionism and so forth, is that if things came to a boil, any boycott of American brands would likely put 3M at risk. And have you given any consideration to that potential development?\nMichael Roman: So Deane, I would say we saw broad-based growth in China, as you heard. And it was led again by our domestic-facing businesses, talked a bit about the trend here and how we're taking advantage of that. So health care, personal safety, some of the domestic-facing parts of our industrial businesses, industrial adhesives and tapes was a strong grower. We also are seeing continued strength in some key trends that are -- we're really taking advantage over their innovations, so air quality, water quality, food safety. And as we start the year, electronics has been in line with the broader China growth. So broad-based growth, led with that broader portfolio in the domestic businesses. When you look at the contingency plans for all the things that we can face in a particular market, that part of it is our broader portfolio and how we think about it with our different customer set. But I -- right now, we see we're well positioned with the China markets and the China customers to be in a good position, whatever the outcome is for -- or the outlook is for the economy there.\nNicholas Gangestad: Deane, this is Nick. Deane, I'll just add one thing. I think you're aware, our strategy in China has been we are putting local manufacturing there that we manufacture within China for our Chinese customers. And that's -- we think that's one other layer of protection we have in our strategy as we execute that in China.\nDeane Dray: That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, Nick, we see that the increase in buybacks announced today -- what's the expectation in terms of adding leverage? Beginning of the year, expected a range of $1.5 billion to $4 billion being added. Where do you expect to be on that range and what kind of timing?\nNicholas Gangestad: Deane, I'm not updating the expected range on leverage. I would say M&A is the biggest variable on what that -- where we'll end up with added leverage, and that's difficult to estimate the timing of that. The range we're seeing right now is our best estimate, the one we communicated in December. This adjustment in share buyback level doesn't impact our total estimated leverage that we expect to add for the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Maybe just the first question on the sort of productivity aspect of the earnings or EPS road map that you laid out previously. If I look at that, you had maybe $0.60 or so in aggregate coming from portfolio and footprint, business transformation and then productivity. So I just wondered, in light of the raw material headwinds and also the shortfall on organic volume growth, if there was any increased urgency around extracting higher savings from productivity this year, whether just pulling some forward or increasing the amount for the year as a whole.\nNicholas Gangestad: Julian, for the year, we're -- we still estimate our productivity level at how we originally estimated that in December. Looking at first quarter with our margins and the underlying productivity, our margins at 23%, underlying productivity was positive. But for the year, we expect that to improve going forward. Our lower volumes in the first quarter, we think, were one of the factors causing productivity to be slightly lower than what we're estimating for the total year. And as the year goes on, we're confident that we'll have productivity in the levels we estimated in December.\nJulian Mitchell: Understood. And then my follow-up would just be around the Electronics and Energy segment. Just trying to understand, you had guided obviously sort of a slowdown there back at the end of 2017. We did see that slowdown very clearly manifest itself in Q1. So as you look at the balance of the year, is there a sense that, that may start to accelerate from that Q1 low base as you move through 2018? Or you think that the current growth rate is representative of the year?\nMichael Roman: Yes. So I would say, Julian, that outlook, as we laid it out at the beginning of the year, it's playing out pretty much in line with that when you look at consumer electronics. We had strong growth in data centers and semiconductor markets, and we see robust demand for our products, our fluids solutions, our interconnect solutions in those markets. And that's offset by that, consumer electronics and the demand we see in those markets. And it -- but that's playing out as expected. And so we're right in our range for what we thought we would be doing as we come through the year.\nInge Thulin: This is Inge. One more comment, yes, around that business group because I think it's important when you talk about volume going forward and so forth. You have to remind yourself and we have to remind ourself the work that's been done relative to the portfolio. So if you go back many years ago -- now if we had tougher growth rate moving forward, we were really challenged on the margin side. And you can see now, quarter after quarter after quarter, and now a couple of years, that the structure is right and the relevance for the market is correct for us. So the margins is now very positive for us and on a high end even for the enterprise and it's sustainable as we move ahead. And I think that's the important element of that business as part of 3M. We manage that now very, very well despite some up and downs in volumes where -- because we know there is some business there that is more volatile, right? But I think the portfolio work now has put us in a place where we feel very, very good quarter-by-quarter in order to be able to deliver the return to you.\nJulian Mitchell: Maybe just on that point, would you characterize the sell in and the sell-through in electronics just being in good balance right now if there's any inventory?\nInge Thulin: Yes, it does. Yes, no increase, yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.\nLaurence Alexander: Two quick ones. Your comments were sprinkled with various end markets or various product lines that touch on construction. Is the traction that you're seeing there, better spending or more -- an increase in spending by your customers? Or is it an innovation cycle on your side? And secondly, with respect to the litigation settlement, can you update us on where you are, what is outstanding, what you see is a time line, if there are any issues to draw before we could reasonably expect to hear the use of shoes, however small, dropping?\nMichael Roman: Yes. So Laurence, on the construction side, so we continue to see strong growth from our home improvement business out of our Consumer Business Group, and that is -- a big part of that is the construction, the growth we see in construction. And the businesses that buy through that channel is -- has been increasing and is being a big, important part of that channel. It's a mix of strong growth in that markets as well as the products that we are bringing to them. I -- we put a lot of innovation into that part of the -- our portfolio, have expanded it and we position ourselves well for the growth that's coming in that end market. So Laurence, just on your second question, back to your second question, on the follow-up to the NRD settlement. We are the process of implementing the grant to the state, and we're working closely with the State of Minnesota, as expected. We are -- we think we've got focus there and well positioned as we move ahead.\nLaurence Alexander: But I guess, maybe just to clarify, is that a precedent for other states? Or does it rule out any similar issues in other states? I mean, just -- there's been a lot of media mudslinging around different scenarios, most of which we're seeing highly improbable. But maybe if you can just give your perspective on that.\nMichael Roman: No, this is a unique situation. This is our home state and something that we've been working on with them for a number of years. So this is a unique situation in both the nature of the case as well as the grant and the process that we're working through with them.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.\nJeffrey Sprague: Just two quick ones for me, if I could. Just back to the consumer question. It is kind of interesting or perhaps concerning, the -- some of the anecdotes you shared there. Do you see in your results potentially kind of a cracking in U.S. consumer strength that perhaps is not readily apparent yet from a macroeconomic standpoint? Or do you actually think it is just some timing noise and other idiosyncratic things going on in a couple of these channels?\nMichael Roman: Yes. Jeff, as you look at the U.S., that was actually one of the strengths of our consumer business as we came through Q1. We saw stronger growth there. And as we talked about, it was led by home improvement, but our home care business was also positive. We continue to see some slight declines in our office channel, but it was broad based, stronger growth in the U.S. market. So no, very much in line with improvements in low GDP and outlook for retail spending.\nJeffrey Sprague: And then just very specifically on dental, oral care, it's just kind of been a slog for you and Danaher and others, all these kind of distribution changes and things going on. Do you see any opportunity there that change the business model, perhaps go direct, not go through these various distribution channels? Are you doing anything proactive there to maybe kind of reshape, reposition that business in any way?\nMichael Roman: It's interesting. The channel for oral care has become more efficient over time. They really changed how they manage it. You see that in maybe our balance in the channel and how our sell in and sellout is balanced in the channel. So we continue to work with, I would say, the changes that -- kind of the constant change that's going on in our commerce channels more broadly. We see that across many of our businesses, oral care included. So I think that's -- our focus always is creating new models to serve our customers. We're focused on those end use customers and we work with our channel partners through their changes and really through new models that come as well. So we're focused on a broad range of strategies there in oral care and beyond.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for some closing comments.\nInge Thulin: Thank you. As I look at our first quarter performance, there are many positives, broad-based growth across all business groups, which included strong pricing, expanded margins and a double-digit increase in EPS. Equally important, we continue to evolve and build out our enterprise for long-term success. 3M is strong and we have the experience, market position and capabilities to continue delivering sustained profitable growth in 2018 and well into the future. Thank you for listening, and have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."}], "2020": [{"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 4, "year": 2019, "date": "2020-01-28 15:22:32", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, January 28, 2020. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2019 business review and 2020 outlook. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chief Executive Officer; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Nick will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Please turn to Slide 2. Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our 2020 quarterly earnings conference calls, which will be held on April 28, July 28 and October 27. Also note, we are planning to host an Investor Meeting in 2020. We will update you once we have finalized the date for the meeting. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Finally, please note that throughout today's presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of today's presentation and press release. Please turn to Slide 4, and I'll hand it off to Mike. Mike?\nMike Roman: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our team executed well in the fourth quarter and delivered results that were in line with our expectations. Although we continue to face growth challenges in certain end markets, our focus on productivity and cost management helped generate solid underlying margins and robust cash flow with a conversion rate of 186%. We also continue to build, invest, and transform for the long-term success of 3M. Earlier today, we issued a press release on the next big phase of our transformation journey, a new global operating model and streamlined organizational structure, which I will discuss in more detail. Today, I will also provide an update on our ongoing commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, including PFAS. Later in the call, I will come back to discuss our full year performance, including record cash flow and good progress on our strategic priorities along with our outlook for 2020 where we expect to return to growth. Please turn to Slide 5, where I will begin with a summary of our fourth quarter results. Organic growth company-wide in the fourth quarter was minus 2.6%, in line with our guidance. We continue to face softness in certain end markets, namely China, automotive, and electronics, which impacted overall growth. We delivered adjusted earnings of $1.95 per share, which includes a $0.20 Q4 restructuring charge that I will discuss shortly. Excluding that charge, we delivered EPS of $2.15 at the high end of our guidance. Finally, we generated underlying margins of 20.7%, which includes a 140 basis point impact from the Acelity acquisition, while reducing inventory levels by $115 million. Overall, I'm pleased with our team's execution and our ongoing progress in driving operational improvements. Please turn to Slide 6. I have talked to you often about the strength and vitality of the 3M value model. We have deep competitive advantages, unique technology platforms, advanced manufacturing, leading brands, and global capabilities, all of which make 3M greater than the sum of our parts. At the same time, we constantly evolve and build on our foundation, which we are doing through our four strategic priorities, including transformation. Over the last several years, we have been on a journey to transform how we serve our customers, how we work, and how we compete. The deployment of our ERP system has enabled new standardized business processes, new service models, and new digitalization capabilities across 3M. In EMEA and Canada, where we are furthest along in our transformation, we are seeing enhanced customer service, improved margins, better use of data analytics, and lower inventories. We are starting to see the same improvements in service, analytics, and inventories in the U.S. as well, which gives us continued confidence in our transformation journey. Importantly, our progress has enabled us to realign the company and further leverage our transformation capabilities. As you know, in April of last year, we moved from five to four business groups to better align around our customers and our four go-to-market models. This was the first step in our realignment. Since then, we have been working on reorganizing the entire company around our new business groups to take full advantage of our new capabilities. On January 1, we implemented a new streamlined global operating model designed to improve growth and operational efficiency. In the new model, our business groups now have full responsibility for all facets of strategy, portfolio and resource prioritization across our entire global operations. Under the prior model, area and country teams had responsibility for setting priorities in their respective regions, part of a distinct international organization. Now all of our international people report directly into the business groups and functions that they are part of, and there is no longer a separate international team. This new model has clear benefits to both 3M and our customers. First, it will drive more accountability to our business groups to strengthen performance and serve both global and local customers. Second, it will enable stronger customer insights in order to drive more powerful innovation. Third, it will empower our people with more freedom to make decisions and increase speed and service to our customers. Fourth, it will make us more efficient and help us continue to drive margin expansion by reducing layers, streamlining structure, and simplifying reporting lines. Finally, it will allow us to leverage similarities across markets, while maintaining the robust local capabilities and expertise that help differentiate 3M. 3M has both experience and success operating in a global model such as this. For several years, our electronics and auto OEM businesses have operated in a global model, and we've seen stronger customer alignment along with better service, innovation, and efficiency. In addition to our new model, we also made changes in 2019 to the way we support our business groups. To optimize the customer experience in each of our go-to-market models, we consolidated manufacturing, supply chain, and customer operations into a seamless end-to-end enterprise operations organization. This team plays a critical role in tailoring service and expertise to the needs of our customers and has been a key driver in enabling us to reduce inventory levels. We also brought together key capabilities around the world as part of a new global corporate affairs organization in order to advance our brand and reputation and build on our history as one of the best places to work around the world. As a result of these actions, today we are announcing a restructuring charge as we move quickly to our new alignment. The restructuring includes streamlining our organization by reducing approximately 1,500 positions spanning all business groups, functions, and geographies. On a pretax basis, we took a restructuring charge of $134 million in Q4, and we expect annual pretax savings of $110 million to $120 million, with $40 million to $50 million in 2020. In our new structure, we will also report geographic results under three areas beginning in Q1 2020: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, Africa; and Asia Pacific, with the same level of detail and transparency as we always have. Ultimately, as I've communicated to all 3M\u2019ers, this is a defining moment for our enterprise. We are modernizing how we run our business and building an organization for the future, and I'm more confident than ever in our journey to transform into a more agile, more efficient, and more competitive enterprise.  Please turn to Slide 7. Being a leader in sustainability and environmental stewardship is core to 3M and is a value that matters deeply to our employees, our stakeholders and to me personally. We started our groundbreaking Pollution Prevention Pays program more than 40 years ago, and we have continued to step up our leadership to address climate and environmental challenges. Last year, we moved our St. Paul headquarters to 100% renewable electricity while committing to move our entire global operations to renewable energy by 2050. 3M also produces a broad range of solutions that help our customers reduce their greenhouse gas emissions from our smog-reducing roofing granules to our films that make homes, electronics and automobiles more energy-efficient. From a governance perspective, we are also strengthening oversight of strategies related to sustainability, R&D and commercialization. In November, our Board established a Science, Technology and Sustainability Committee to ensure we are building on our strong innovation capabilities while advancing our already high standards for product and environmental stewardship. This commitment to sustainability includes stewardship of water, one of our most precious resources. As part of our responsibility, we are proactively managing PFAS, guided by the principles of sound science, corporate responsibility and transparency. We are committed to being part of the solution to ensure communities have confidence in their water. This includes addressing contamination at sites where we produced or disposed of PFAS. In addition, we will work with our customers and our other stakeholders in connection with other sites where PFAS concerns exist. Our efforts under these commitments led to a litigation-related pretax charge of $214 million in the fourth quarter, split roughly equally between the following two items: First, we updated our assessment of environmental matters and litigation related to our manufacture and disposal of PFAS, which included expanding our evaluation to other 3M sites that may have used certain PFAS material. Second, we updated our assessment of customer-related litigation based on ongoing settlement discussions. At the same time, we continue to work with the EPA and other authorities to ensure we are fulfilling our ongoing commitment to environmental stewardship. As previously disclosed, in 2019, 3M discovered and voluntarily informed the EPA and appropriate state authorities that discharges from our Decatur, Alabama facility may not have complied with permit requirements. We immediately idled the relevant processes and took steps to address these issues. In connection with our Decatur disclosures, 3M received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Alabama in late December 2019, and we are cooperating with this inquiry. In addition, in Q4 of 2019, as part of our compliance assessment of similar sites, we identified and also disclosed to the EPA and appropriate state authorities similar discharge issues at our Cordova, Illinois facility. We continue to support the EPA and the Alabama and Illinois state environmental authorities to help resolve these matters. We have a strong cross-functional team in place that is actively managing our environmental stewardship and PFAS. And moving forward, we will continue to update you as developments unfold. If you haven't already, I encourage you to visit our PFAS stewardship website, which can be found on our Investor Relations site under the heading About 3M. That wraps up my opening remarks. I will come back to discuss our full year performance along with our 2020 guidance after Nick takes you through the details of the quarter. Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8 with a recap of our fourth quarter sales performance. Fourth quarter organic sales declined 2.6%. Volumes were down 340 basis points, while selling prices were up 80 basis points. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increased sales by 5.1 percentage points, while foreign currency translation was a 40 basis point headwind to sales. All-in fourth quarter sales in U.S. dollars grew 2.1% versus last year. Looking at growth geographically. U.S. organic growth declined 3%, primarily due to declines in the Transportation and Electronics and Safety and Industrial businesses. Asia-Pacific declined 3% in Q4 with Japan down 7%, primarily due to a decline in our Electronics business. Organic growth was up 1% in China. This result is primarily due to last year's easier comparison. EMEA declined 3% while Latin America, Canada was flat. Please turn to Slide 9 for the fourth quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide fourth quarter sales were $8.1 billion with adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion. Adjusted operating margins were 19%, which included a negative 170 basis point impact from restructuring. Considering this impact fourth quarter operating margins were right in line with our expectations. On the right hand side of this slide, you see the components of our margin performance in the fourth quarter. Lower organic volumes and our continued efforts to reduce inventories to improve cash flow were both headwinds to margins year-over-year. Partially offsetting these headwinds were benefits from our Q2 restructuring actions. In total, these factors resulted in 110 basis point reduction to margins versus last year's fourth quarter. Acquisitions and divestitures combined reduced margins by 140 basis points mainly related to our acquisition of Acelity. Higher selling prices along with slightly lower raw material costs contributed 70 basis points to fourth quarter margins. And finally, foreign currency net of hedging impacts increased margins by 10 basis points. Let's now turn to Slide 10 for a closer look at earnings per share. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings were $1.95 per share and as Mike noted included a $0.20 impact from our Q4 restructuring, which was not factored into our prior guidance. Accounting for this item, earnings were $2.15 per share, right in line with the high end of our guidance range. Looking at the components of our year-on-year earnings performance. The net impact of organic growth, inventory reductions and other items I covered on the prior slide reduced fourth quarter per share earnings by $0.13. Acquisitions and divestitures combined, reduced fourth quarter earnings by $0.11 per share versus last year, primarily due to Acelity. Please note that this result includes the impacts of both financing and tax costs. While early, Acelity is off to a good start as our team delivered results better than expected. Turning to tax rate. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 20.3% versus 20.5% last year. As noted with acquisitions, M&A and restructuring categories in this table include their own year-on-year tax impacts with the remaining impact of $0.05 reflected in this line. And finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined 1.7% versus Q4 last year, adding $0.03 to per share earnings. Please turn to Slide 11 for a look at our cash flow performance. As Mike noted, we delivered another quarter of robust free cash flow with fourth quarter free cash flow of $1.8 billion. For the full year, free cash flow increased 10% to $5.4 billion as our teams delivered strong working capital management throughout 2019. Fourth quarter conversion was 186%, which included a 27 percentage point benefit from the significant litigation-related charges. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $538 million, with the full year totaling $1.7 billion. Also during the fourth quarter, we returned $1 billion to shareholders via dividends and gross share repurchases. And for the full year, we returned $4.7 billion. Please turn to Slide 12, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q4. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which declined 2.8% organically in the quarter. Our Personal Safety and Industrial Minerals businesses delivered mid single-digit organic growth in the quarter, while the balance of the portfolio declined. Looking geographically, organic growth increased in Latin America, Canada while Asia-Pacific, the U.S. and EMEA each declined. Safety and Industrial's fourth quarter operating margins were 20.9%. Overall, margins continued to be solid when considering negative organic growth, inventory reductions and restructuring impacts. Moving to Transportation and Electronics. As expected, fourth quarter sales were down 5.9% organically compared to last year, impacted by end market softness worldwide. Our electronics-related businesses showed sequential improvement, despite year-over-year being down mid-single digits organically as demand remained soft in consumer electronics and factory automation end markets. Our automotive OEM business was down 5%, a bit better than fourth quarter global car and light truck builds, which were down 6%. Transportation and Electronics fourth quarter operating margins were 20.8%. Similar to Safety and Industrial, margins were impacted by lower sales, inventory reductions and restructuring. Turning to our Health Care business. Organic growth was flat year-over-year against last year's strong comparison. Growth was led by mid single-digit increases in health information systems and food safety. Medical Solutions, our largest business was up slightly, while oral care declined low single-digits in the quarter. Looking geographically, growth was led by Latin America, Canada and EMEA, while the U.S. declined. Health Care fourth quarter operating margins were 21.3%, impacted by nearly 8 percentage points from the combination of the M*Modal and Acelity acquisitions along with restructuring. Taking these factors into account, margins were up 100 basis points year-over-year. Lastly, fourth quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was flat. Sales were led by mid-single-digit growth in home improvement and low single-digit growth in home care, while stationery and office and consumer declined. Looking at Consumer geographically, Latin America/Canada grew mid-single digits. The U.S. was up nearly 1%, while EMEA and Asia Pacific declined. Consumer's operating margins were a strong 23.4%, up 3 percentage point year-over-year, driven by portfolio and footprint actions we have been executing in this business. That wraps up our review of fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 13, and I'll hand it back over to Mike. Mike?\nMike Roman: Thank you, Nick. As I look at 2019, I'm encouraged how our team responded to the challenges we faced in our end markets: stepping up our execution, improving operations and driving strong cash flow as we move through the year. We finalized the restructuring we announced in April, effectively managed costs and reduced inventory levels by $370 million. With respect to the full year numbers, organic growth company-wide was minus 1.5%. We posted adjusted earnings of $9.10 per share, which included a $0.21 benefit from the divestiture of our gas and flame detection business. We increased cash flow by 10% year-over-year to $5.4 billion, an all-time high for our enterprise, while delivering a strong conversion rate of 118%. Additionally, we posted a good return on invested capital of 18%, including the impact of acquisitions. In 2019, we also returned $4.7 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And last year marked our 61st consecutive year of dividend increases. Please turn to Slide 14. Beyond financial results, I view 2019 as a fundamentally significant year for 3M as we implemented major change to position us well for the future. Earlier, I talked about how we are accelerating the pace of our transformation, and we also made significant progress on our other three priorities for long-term growth and value creation. I'll make a few comments on each, starting with portfolio. The ongoing review and reshaping of our portfolio is critical to maximizing value across our company. Since 2012, we have moved from 40 businesses to 23, while completing more than 10 divestitures and 14 acquisitions. In 2019, we continued portfolio, with particular progress in strengthening our Health Care business. We acquired Acelity, which accelerates 3M as a leader in advanced wound care, along with MModal's technology business, an ideal fit within our health information systems business. The integration of Acelity is going well, and the business is off to a good start. And M*Modal is outperforming our expectations for both growth and income. We also announced that we will divest our drug delivery business, which will enable us to focus more resources on our core Health Care portfolio. Beyond our efforts in Health Care, last year, we sold our gas and flame detection business. And earlier this month, we finalized the sale of our ballistic-protection business. Managing our portfolio is an ongoing process, and we'll continue to act on opportunities to maximize value across 3M. Our next priority is innovation, which is the heart of our enterprise. It differentiates 3M in the marketplace and supports organic growth and our long track record of delivering premium margins and return on invested capital. In 2019, we invested $3.6 billion in the combination of R&D and CapEx. These investments enable us to invent unique products and solutions and then deliver them efficiently to our customers through our disruptive manufacturing process technologies. That it is more than the breadth of our technology that sets us apart. It's also our ability to share, combine and apply our technologies across 3M businesses. Our adhesives, for example, are in cars and airplanes, electronics and medical tapes and in the products you're most familiar with, such as Command strips and Post-it notes. And as the needs of our customers evolve, we constantly develop new capabilities and applications to stay at the forefront of innovation. Last year, we expanded our periodic table to 51 technology platforms as we further refined our expertise in areas like meta-materials, computer vision and advanced robotics. We also continue to see strong returns from investments in our priority growth platforms, which serve emerging and fast-growing markets. For the full year, these platforms grew 10% as we create differentiated solutions for customers around health care, transportation, safety and infrastructure. For example, automotive electrification grew 9% as we continue to drive good penetration, with particular strength in automotive displays and lightweighting solutions. Going forward, we will continue to use 3M innovation to solve tough problems for our customers, improve people's lives and help create a more sustainable world. Turning now to people and culture, which is foundational to each of our other priorities. In 2019, we took significant action to develop our people and invigorate our culture, and the transformation initiatives I discussed earlier are at the center of our efforts. Our transformation journey is as much a cultural change as it is a technology change. We are simplifying workflows, equipping our people with new systems and tools and empowering them with more autonomy to make faster decisions. Given the level of transformation within 3M, a key focus of our development is managing change, and I am pleased how our team is stepping up to embrace these changes. At the same time, we are deepening our commitment to 3M's core values, including diversity and inclusion, 60% of our top 100 leaders are diverse, one-third of our corporate officers and Board members are women, and we are doing more to integrate inclusion into our daily life. Of course, underpinning everything we do is our code of conduct. And last year, 3M again was named one of the world's most ethical companies. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we made against each of our strategic priorities in 2019, and I am confident in how we are positioned heading into 2020. Please turn to Slide 15. As a result of our work, we are well positioned to return to growth in 2020. Our plan reflects our improved performance and expectation for low but positive global macroeconomic growth. We anticipate organic growth of flat to 2%, along with earnings of $9.30 to $9.75 per share. We expect another year of robust cash flow conversion rate of 95% to 105%. Finally, we anticipate a strong return on invested capital of 18% to 21%. In the appendix of our slide presentation, you will find additional details on our guidance, including a breakdown of our expectations for organic growth by business group and area. Before turning to Q&A, I have one additional announcement. Our Executive Vice President of International, Julie Bushman, has informed us of her intent to retire in April. Throughout her 36 years at 3M, Julie has been an exceptional leader and has created tremendous value for our company and our shareholders. Julie's leadership has been invaluable throughout her time leading our international team, including her role and working closely with me to lead the transformation announcements we discussed today. I thank Julie for her many years of service and many contributions. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please proceed with your questions.\nScott Davis: Hey good morning guys.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Davis: As far as the \u2013 I mean, there's some noise out there with this virus in China and stuff, and you sell a fair amount of products into \u2013 that benefit, but at the same time, there's some offsets and slower growth in China overall. But when you think about, Mike, the cadence of returning growth in 2020, is there a sense of when? Is it 1Q as you start to get into some easier comps or is it more towards the back end of the year?\nMike Roman: So Scott, I would start with the model for returning growth in 2020 is based on that broader macro, that outlook for the broader macro. It also is looking at some of those key markets that we talked about that were challenges for us in 2019. China, for example, one of the challenges in 2019. We see that in our model for 2020 returning to low-to-mid single-digit growth for the total year. In both cases, I would say, we see growth strengthening as we move through the year. So Q1, positive growth for the overall enterprise in the middle range \u2013 middle of the overall guidance of the range, maybe a little slightly lower end of the guidance of the range. And China, in particular, before we got to the last couple of weeks with the coronavirus really becoming the focus, we were looking at a sluggish start to China in first quarter really based on automotive, and the build rate's expected to be down mid-single digits and maybe even high-single digits. And so it's \u2013 that was kind of our pacing. Now coronavirus, it's kind of changing things as we go and we're seeing what you're seeing. We're seeing increased demand for our respiratory protection products, and we're ramping up our production worldwide, in China, around the world to meet that demand. At the same time, we're seeing what everybody else is seeing, that there's \u2013 the businesses are shutting down, extending their shutdown beyond Lunar New Year. So, we're really watching day to day what that's going to mean for our outlook for China, but I'll give you kind of the frame we had and then how we're kind of looking at it as we see the updates day by day.\nScott Davis: Okay. That's helpful, Mike. And just as a quick follow-up. Will Acelity be accretive to your growth rate in 2020? Will that be above your guidance range in your view?\nNick Gangestad: So Scott, this is Nick. We \u2013 Acelity is, of course, incorporated in the guidance that we're giving there. Throughout the year, most of its growth will be coming through what we report for acquisitions versus organic growth, but when we compare it to the underlying growth that was a revenue that was there before we acquired it, we see its growth as accretive to the overall 3M growth rate that we're projecting.\nScott Davis: Okay, super helpful. Thanks, good luck guys.\nMike Roman: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, good morning.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Hey, so just wanted to touch on the additional PFAS charge here. I mean I think I understand the Alabama and Illinois plant issues, but what's the trigger for the customer litigation charge? I mean, obviously, there has to be a trigger to get you to recognize that charge. Maybe just touch on \u2013 there's obviously a speculation about EPA regulation. Where do you stand on that issue?\nMike Roman: Yes. So maybe I'll take the charge first, Nigel. So, we played out in the prepared remarks that there are two aspects to the charge. One is our ongoing commitment to resolve the issues where we manufacture and dispose the PFAS. The other part of the charge is related to really ongoing negotiations with customers. As part of our commitment is to do our part to help customers address the PFAS issues they face, and we've got our negotiations and mediation as far enough along that we can identify what's probable and estimable around a group of customers. It's multiple customers. It does account for the Wolverine cases that we've been \u2013 we've talked about in the past, but it's multiple customers, and really the next step of what we can understand is probable and estimable. So then in working with \u2013 one of the commitments we did make in last fall is to work in support of the EPA as we move forward with their regulatory plan around PFAS. They've got a \u2013 they've laid out a plan to move forward. We are working to support that with our investment in research and understanding \u2013 helping the understanding of PFAS, providing our data and really doing things like helping to provide a clearinghouse for all of the information and data around PFAS. And so, we continue to be working in support of the EPA in our work on our resolving, our manufacturing disposal sites, and then also on moving the regulatory standards forward.\nNigel Coe: Thank you. A quick follow-on on the 2020 guidance. On the cash flow, the $5.3 billion to $6 billion of free cash, are you simply assuming delevering of the balance sheet in the bridge?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. Nigel, we\u2019re not \u2013 as we ended 2019, we had debt-to-EBITDA ratio of roughly \u2013 just a little over 2.5 times. We see that coming down probably about 50 basis points to be two or just slightly over two times debt to EBITDA, so that's part of our overall capital structure planning in 2020.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Thanks, Nick. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks, good morning everyone.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Joe. \nJoe Ritchie: Hey, Mike, can you expand a little bit on the commentary on this, the new restructuring initiatives that you have in place and how that differs from business transformation, fully recognizing that it sounds like you're streamlining the organization as well? But any additional color you can provide there would be helpful. (Auidt End)\nMike Roman: Yes. And Joe, what I laid out is really the next phase of our transformation journey, and it's taking advantage of everything that we've done, deploying the ERP, the ecosystem around it, the service models that we put in place, the capabilities, the technical capabilities to really manage our business, digitize a lot of what we do to manage our operations and our business processes. And so it became clear that we could take full advantage of that with how we operate our businesses globally. And last spring, we announced moving from five to four businesses. At the time, it was \u2013 it looked like a realignment of the company, but where does it go? And this is really the next part of the story. We aligned around our customers and our go-to-market models. And with the launch in the new year of the new model, we are going to operate globally around those go-to-market models. And that includes how we operate our businesses everywhere around the world. It includes taking advantage of the capabilities we put in place with business transformation, and then It also includes this really consolidation of our manufacturing, supply chain and customer operations end-to-end to really optimize for those go-to-market models. So it's a significant change in really how we align the customers, how we bring our innovation to market, how we streamline and simplify 3M around the world. It is taking advantage of business transformation, but it's really transformation, but it's really multiplying that impact as we move ahead.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, thank you. And then maybe just my follow-on, focused on the Transportation and Electronics segment. Clearly, that's a segment that has \u2013 had a tough 2019, and I think that there's some optimism in 2020 that we'll potentially start to see a rebound, particularly in the electronics side of things. And so if we were to start to see better growth, what kind of operating leverage would you guys expect to see out of that business? And in your commentary, Mike, earlier around positive organic growth in the first quarter, is this a segment that is also going to be positive in Q1?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. Joe, let me take that one. First of all from \u2013 to the second part of your question, Transportation and Electronics, for the year we've guided that negative 2% to positive 2% organic growth. Our view right now, as we see all four quarters in that range. Right now, and just to go a little off track, the Safety and Industrial business is the only one that we see a potential that that one would be below its range in the first quarter and then in the next three quarters within the range that we've guided. As far as leverage that we expect in Transportation and Electronics, this is one of the businesses where as we see us returning to growth in that, that this would be accretive and would be adding to our leverage that we see that. A specific percentage, we typically don't put out, but it would be beneficial and we'd see the margins, the accretive margins there very similar to what we see for the total company, that as we rebuild the revenue there that we would be seeing that maybe an extra 10% going to increasing the margin as that \u2013 as the revenue improves there.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. Thank you both.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Good morning. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew.\nMike Roman: Good morning, David.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Good morning. Can you provide details on how your core gross margin will trend in 2020 given the unusual inventory related effect in 2019?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. The gross margins and our overall margins, but a part of \u2013 a big part of it will be our \u2013 through our gross margin improvement. We see overall operating margins improving 50 basis points to 100 basis points in 2020. And in the first quarter, we expect them to be roughly flat prior to the impact of Acelity. Acelity, we again \u2013 we \u2013 because that was not part of our base in the first quarter, we expect that will be a negative impact to our total company margins of about 100 basis points in the first quarter, and will impact Health Care's margins by 400 basis points to 500 basis points in the first quarter. But the underlying margins in first quarter, excluding that we see roughly flat and then some expansion, because our primary inventory reductions that we were executing were occurring in the second, third and fourth quarter. And as we move into that that range then we \u2013 that's when we expect to be seen margin expansion, particularly gross margin expansion in 2020.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it. And for the follow-up, what are the sort of tailwinds do you see within Health Care? And do you see potential upside to the 2% to 4% organic guidance for the full year as you get to the second half of the year? Thank you.\nMike Roman: Yes. If you look at 2020 David, Health Care is going to be a leader for growth for us and that is really on some of the strengths that we saw coming out of 2019. We see continued strength in health information systems and with the M*Modal addition being part of that in our food-safety business. Our medical solutions business, we see that benefiting from the strong market \u2013 outlook for market growth in Health Care. And so we see, and I would say, continued strength in developing markets helping to lead that growth forward. So it's some of the areas that we saw strengths in 2019 and then some of the things that we've been able to build upon with our acquisitions and leverage even stronger positions against a good macroeconomic outlook.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Inch: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nNick Gangestad: Hey, John.\nMike Roman: Good morning John.\nJohn Inch: Good morning guys. Nick, can we start on the EPS road map, Slide 27? So you've dialed in minus $0.25 for 2019 headwinds. I think it's interesting. It's not a range. It's an exact precise number. What exactly is in that? For example, like our compensation headwinds, so having to pay people more money, is that in there? And anything you could say on that? Was there flex around it? What is going on there?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, John, there's two precise things in there, which is why it's not a range. About one-third of that is from gains we took in 2019 on disposal of certain properties, certain assets we had, that I talked about during our third quarter earnings call. The other two-thirds of that, John, is coming from variable compensation. With our results that were delivering \u2013 delivered in 2019, our variable comp is below our planned variable comp level. And we've built our plan for 2020 that we would be returning to planned variable comp. And that's why we're calling that out as a 2019 headwind.\nJohn Inch: And can I ask you, Nick why is that fixed? For instance, let's just say the economy got better as 2020 progressed and you did much better than your zero to 2% core growth. Does that variable number also not dial up? Or is it kind of a fixed bonus? Like, why wouldn't the $0.25 possibly dial a little bit higher as a drag?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. So in 2020, if we start to see our compensation being different than that, then our normal practice would be that becomes part of productivity. So if we are paying more than our planned variable comp that would become a headwind to our productivity that we're projecting in 2020.\nJohn Inch: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, Nick, can you remind us what's going on \u2013 or Mike. What's going on in Europe? I had in my notes \u2013 I thought that you were sort of on deck to maybe downsize your European footprint, I think pro forma, like about a third of production facilities, with a lot of this happening in the back half of 2019. Where do we stand on that? And I noticed that, for instance, Europe, on the core sequentially got worse. Was that actually \u2013 was that self-inflicted because of this associated internal disruption or actions? Or is there something else? Just is it just macro in Europe? Just where do we stand in Europe overall and the runway even to your 20% plus margins that you talked about at the last Analyst Meeting, Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. John thanks for asking that question. And there are several moving parts in there. First, let me talk to the margin, and then I'll talk to the growth. 2019 was a very good year of progress for us with our operating income margins again expanding in Europe to approximately 19%, very much along the trajectory that we were projecting that we would be on to be moving this to a 20% operating income margin by 2020. As part of that, we've been taking a number of action over the last few years. Some of them had been footprint actions, and we are starting to see some of that benefit manifest in our 2019 results going forward into 2020. Also, there's been some portfolio adjustments, where there are certain product lines where we've been going through and prioritizing and deciding either to exit or to de-prioritize and de-resource. And as we look at our organic growth in 2019 as well as, in particular, you're asking about fourth quarter of 2019, that's been impacted, impacted by 50 basis points to 100 basis points of organic growth by some of our \u2013 what we have planned and done from a portfolio standpoint as part of our move to shift our portfolio in Europe. Much of the rest has been macro of what we're seeing. Plus, a little bit right now what we're seeing in the fourth quarter is a comparison that we're going against fourth quarter last year in Europe. This was very much in the range we're expecting. But macro, we're continuing to see auto builds down in Europe, and that does impact our overall EMEA results.\nJohn Inch: But EMEA is up. Do you think it hits your 20% target in 2020 or maybe even a little bit better?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. We see ourselves very much in-line to be hitting that. Could be a little ahead, but I wouldn't get too far ahead on that. We see ourselves right in line to be hitting that.\nJohn Inch: Got it. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nNick Gangestad: Hi, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Hey, Mike, I was hoping to circle back on the restructuring announcement today, and I wanted to put it in context with what we're seeing across the multi-industry sector, where a number of companies are pursuing simplification via larger spinouts, bigger, bolder moves versus kind of what I would characterize, 3M has been more surgical. Have you looked \u2013 as a result, you look more like an outlier in terms of your simplification approach. Is it \u2013 what's your response there? Is it really company-specific? Are there opportunities to do something bigger? Is that \u2013 might be another next phase? But if you could give us some color there, that would be helpful.\nMike Roman: Yes, Deane. We \u2013 what I framed it up is this is part of our transformation journey. And if you look back, even back to the Investor Day in November of 2018, we laid out a plan for margin improvement over the coming years, and a big part of that was from transformation. So there was a plan by us to really keep moving forward in this. This announcement today is the next phase of that plan to move forward with an alignment around those four go-to-market models, our customers, better leverage all the business transformation investments we put in place. And we are optimizing as we go. We're building on the capabilities we've put in place. You saw that in 2019 start to come through our EMEA and Canada results in terms of margins and service and inventory management improving there. We \u2013 it was part of getting on top of inventory in North America, too, as we deployed the new capabilities. And so I wouldn't call it a \u2013 I wouldn't think of it as a one-step in the middle of this. It's part of our transformation journey. And so we'll continue to optimize off of this. This is \u2013 enables \u2013 the charge that we took in Q4 enables us to move quickly to the alignment, get the full benefit of it as we go forward. It's really, we think, going to be an important part of what positions us to deliver growth and better efficiency as we go through 2020 and beyond.\nDeane Dray: That\u2019s helpful. And then just staying on the restructuring, the payback for 2019, did \u2013 that's $40 million to $50 million in savings. Just based upon the size of the restructuring that seems a slower payback, does that have more to do with the timing of how you'll do these reductions?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Deane, that really is a function of this. As we move to streamline the \u2013 our operations there, not all of it is happening right away. There's parts of it that phase in over the course of the year, and that's why it's only having a $40 million to $50 million impact. Some of it, a minority position, part of that will come in the first half of the year. The vast majority of that $40 million to $50 million comes in the second half of the year.\nDeane Dray: Got it. Thanks helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nJohn Walsh: Yes, good morning.\nMike Roman: Hey John.\nNick Gangestad: Hey John.\nJohn Walsh: Wanted to talk about the price performance in the quarter and specific to the U.S., but happy if you want to broaden it out. As we think about that 1.7% price increase, that's a higher number than we've seen here in the past. Is that priced because of innovation and sustainable? Or did you hold price, and that was kind of impacting why the volume was down in the U.S.?\nNick Gangestad: John, the price growth \u2013 first of all, let me expand it to the full year for U.S. price growth. With that 1.7%, that brings our full year price growth to 80 basis points. John, I think that's the more helpful number for you to look at and focus on. Often in a quarter-to-quarter basis, there's going to be what is it comparing to in the quarter in the prior year. So I won't overreact to the 1.7%. Our view is the 80 basis points that we did in the U.S. in total 2019, that's indicative of what we're doing. And to the first premise of your question, what we overall see in price growth is a function of the value we are creating. It's the innovation we have in our products and continuing to update the product lines and the products that we offer there. And that is a big driver of that. But I won't focus on the 1.7%. I'd focus more on the full year, the 80 basis points.\nJohn Walsh: Got you. And then maybe coming at the flat to up 2% organic just a different way. If we think about 2019, particularly on the automotive side, you did have some impact from channel inventory destocking. I don't know if it's possible, but have you thought about what the growth rate would look like just with the absence of those headwinds? And how much of that kind of flat to 2% is just a normalization versus the macro getting any better?\nMike Roman: John, the return to growth of zero to 2% that is really reflecting both the macro and then I think a closer look at the markets that we've been challenged within 2019. So electronics, automotive, China. And in 2019, as you noted, there was an impact from channel reactions. As they saw the decline in those markets, they reacted, took out inventory. So part of the year-over-year, in those markets, comparison is going to be a more stable channel. We do see more balanced inventory in those channels. I would say electronics; we're seeing the early signs of maybe some encouraging outlook in areas like semiconductor, fabrication and data centers. In automotive, the outlook for the year is still negative build rates. Slightly negative, I think, is the broader economic view. We're a little more conservative than that in a slower start to the year. But again, I would say our view is \u2013 also has that idea of balanced inventory in the face of those outlooks.\nJohn Walsh: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Good morning, guys.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Andy.\nNick Gangestad: Hey Andy.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Mike, can we go back to Health Care for a second? I know that you changed the reporting last year and put separation and purification, and that's continuing the growth a little bit. But you, I'm sure, recall that Health Care was supposed to be a 2% to 4% grower in 2019 and reported a little under 2% and the 4% to 6% through 2023. So I know you're saying 2% to 4% for 2020. Has the impact on Health Care just been, I guess, unexpected cyclicality? Or have you sort of reassessed the long-term growth of the business? And is there any sort of thought about accelerating portfolio optimization in that particular business beyond selling drug delivery?\nMike Roman: Well, Andy, I would say, as I highlighted in my speech, we have been focused with our portfolio actions on Health Care. As you mentioned, drug delivery and the plan to divest that, adding Acelity, adding M*Modal into our health information systems. And if you go back to Q4, the growth \u2013 organic growth in Q4 was positive across most of the portfolio. It was led by mid-single-digit growth in health information systems and food safety. Medical solutions was up slightly in the quarter. Oral care declined in the low single digits. And so that was maybe the focus of the softer growth in Q4. We did see strong growth geographically in areas like China and other parts of the world. So that's kind of what we carry into 2020. And we see medical solutions improving. The market outlook there is strong, and our position is strong. We see health information, food safety continuing. We see separation and purification getting a little better. And so we \u2013 all of that together positions us in a stronger growth for the outlook for the total year.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Mike, that's helpful. And then, Nick, just looking at the walk for 2020 again. Do you still see the potential for additional property sales? So there may be an element of conservatism in that item. And then you talked about a pretty wide range for this year in terms of productivity impacts from zero to $0.25. It seems that's like a little higher than usual. Is productivity more dependent on what organic growth is this year and that's why it's a little hard to pin down in 2020?\nNick Gangestad: Andy, I just want to make sure you asked, where the potential for other property sales and if that's what you said, no, we're not anticipating anything of any material magnitude on gains or losses from property sales in 2020. In terms of the range that we have for productivity between zero and 25% \u2013 $0.25, that's might be a little wider than normal. And I think it does reflect as we're coming off a year where our margins were declining as we were having noticeable drops in inventory as well as we're going through the transformation and the restructuring charges we've called out and isolated the restructuring charges, but that's also a driver of our productivity and we're isolating that, and just the interplay of that adds a little more complexity for that. And we see the zero to $0.25 is like our best estimate right now. And of course we're going to be striving to be on the higher end of that, but it's where we are building our plans right now.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Thanks for that Nick.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi. Good morning guys.\nMike Roman: Good morning Josh.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Just a follow-up on Andy's question a little bit on productivity, maybe slightly a different way. I guess Nick, how does zero end up in the range? You mentioned kind of the under-absorption and destocking issues, which I think caught you by surprise in the first quarter of last year, in particular on the volume drop. What would be the driver of the lower end of that range? Is it \u2013 if demand is better and like you said the incentive comp is a hit to productivity? Just trying to understand what the downside could be or what even drive the pressures to that?\nNick Gangestad: Josh a couple of things. First of all, as would typically be the expectation if our growth is on the lower end of our range, I think that puts a little pressure to us on the lower end of the productivity range that we've laid out here, and included in that productivity range there's positive things that we're doing such as where we're seeing where the utilization of our factories in comparison to 2019. But it's also \u2013 we're also facing into as we do every year wage inflation so offsetting wage inflation is part of that. We also have other things that are impacted in there. For example, what we've called out under other and other pension expense that hits the non-offline is being flat year-on-year. Included in our productivity there is a between $0.06 and $0.07 headwind for increased pension expenses, that's part of that productivity number. So there is a negative headwind \u2013 there is headwinds we're facing and there as we face a zero to 25%.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the demand outlook. I think clearly there is an expectation maybe a few months ago that we were on this kind of linear recovery and maybe a mid-year bigger inflection in demand across the industrial universe. It seems like January has been a little slower for everyone. If you guys had a snap the line today versus some of the potential may be green shoots you could have been seeing 30 days or 60 days ago, as anything seen pushed out or off track or is this just kind of a timing issue and we shouldn't read anything into January?\nMike Roman: Josh, I think you laid it out. The way we looked at that low growth macroeconomic especially in industrial, industrial production index kind of view of that it was getting better as we went through the year. That's the way we built our outlook for the year, our plan. I would say the biggest change since that has been what's going on in China. And it's \u2013 that will be the \u2013 have the biggest impact on how the first quarter plays out and then how we move further into the year. So I think that's the most important thing to be watching out.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. Appreciate the color. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in.\nNick Gangestad: Hey, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Just a quick question following up on inventories. I think Nick or Mike; you'd said that you had a $370 million drawdown in 2019 overall. Maybe just help us understand what the margin impact of that drawdown was for the full year 2019. And also, as you sit here today, do you view your channel inventories that your customers and partners as being fairly normal? Or is there a bit more to go of destock in Q1? And then, switching back to 3M itself on inventory, do you have that old medium-term goal of a $500 million reduction, where do we stand on that?\nNick Gangestad: Julian, several questions all at once. So first of all, on the $370 million of inventory reduction, our estimate that that's negatively impacted our operating margins or our gross margins in 2019 by 50 basis points to 100 basis points. That's true both for the fourth quarter and also true for the full year about 50 basis points to 100 basis points. And we see that flipping to be part \u2013 that's part of our guidance of the margin improvement in 2020 is having that headwind behind us. As far as channel inventories, there's always some puts and takes. I'd say we're seeing nothing abnormal right now with channel inventories. We have, of course as we've said throughout the year we've seen some reductions in our inventory \u2013 channel held inventories, but right now, I'd characterize it is fairly normal where we stand with inventories. And then we \u2013 in 2020 we do anticipate that we will bring down inventories a bit more, nothing on the magnitude of the $370 million that we did in 2019, but we expect we will be \u2013 we'll continue our progress of taking down our inventories slightly in 2020. As far as the guidance we had given prior of $500 million. We see the progress that we made in 2019 as most of that reduction getting us back to where we were when we first said that and some of that starting to make progress on that $500 million. We still see opportunities in the coming years for us to operate our supply chain even more efficiently and gather even more of that $500 million inventory reduction through our cash flow in the coming years. We've made some progress in 2019, we'll make more in 2020 and we'll make more in 2021.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.\nMike Roman: To wrap up. In the fourth quarter, we leveraged the strengths of the 3M business model to navigate market conditions while delivering strong cash flow and solid margins. We also continue to make significant progress on our transformation journey with the rollout of our new operating model. We enter 2020 in a strong strategic and financial position poised to return to growth and deliver value for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the 3M Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, October 24, 2019. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2019 business review. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Nick will make some formal comments, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Today\u2019s earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading, Quarterly Earnings. Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our future investor events. Please turn to Slide 2. Our Q4 earnings conference call will be held on January 28th, 2020. Please note we will be providing our 2020 guidance during our January call. As a result, we will not be having a 2020 outlook meeting later this year. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note that throughout today\u2019s presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation and press release. Please turn to Slide 4 and I\u2019ll hand it off to Mike. Mike?\nMike Roman: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The 3M team executed well and delivered a strong operational performance in the third quarter, building on our progress in the second quarter, while the macroeconomic environment remains challenging, we continue to effectively manage costs, improve productivity, and invest for the future. We exceeded the cost savings plan that we laid out in April, at the same time reducing inventory by $180 million. This is on top of the $250 million reduction in Q2. Our underlying margins were strong, and we generated robust free cash flow with a conversion rate of 106%. At the same time, we are making good progress on our four strategic priorities for value creation, portfolio, transformation, innovation, and people and culture. For example, two weeks ago, we finalized our acquisition of Acelity, which is an exciting addition to 3M's health care portfolio. In Q3, we also divested our gas and flame detection business and announced the sale of our ballistic protection business, all part of our ongoing effort to optimize our portfolio. Later in today's call, I will also discuss our guidance for the full-year and provide an update on PFAS. Please turn to Slide 5 for a summary of our third quarter results. Organic growth company-wide was minus 1%. We continue to face softness in certain end markets, namely China, automotive and electronics, which represent 30% of our company. Growth in the rest of our business was positive. And we saw strength in end-markets such as residential construction, medical and consumer retail, which Nick will discuss. We also continue to see good returns from our investments in innovation, including the priority growth platforms we have shared with you in the past. Year-to-date, these platforms are up 9% as we create differentiated solutions for customers in areas such as auto electrification, connected safety, and structural adhesives. Turning to EPS, we delivered GAAP earnings of $2.72 per share, a 5% increase year-over-year. Please note that this includes a $0.14 benefit from the Q3 divestiture that I talked about earlier. We generated underlying margins of 23.8% with all business groups above 23%. For the second consecutive quarter, we improved our margins on a sequential basis while reducing inventory, which shows that our productivity actions are working. We also saw notable improvements in both EMEA and Canada, two areas where we have deployed our new business processes end-to-end. In these areas, we are seeing improved margins, better use of data analytics, lower inventories and enhanced customer service, which gives us continued confidence in our ability to realize the benefits from our transformation journey. In summary, I'm pleased with our team's progress in the third quarter. I thank them for their efforts and continued focus as we move forward. That wraps up my opening remarks. I will come back with some additional comments after Nick takes you through the details of the quarter, Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 6 with a recap of our third quarter sales performance. Third quarter organic sales declined 1.3%. Volumes were down 160 basis points, while selling prices were up 30 basis points. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increased sales by 60 basis points. Well, foreign currency translation was a 130 basis point headwind to sales. All-in third quarter sales in U.S. dollars declined 2% versus last year. Looking at growth geographically, the U.S. declined 1% organically. Consumer and health care each delivered solid growth in the quarter. This was more than offset by declines in safety and industrial and transportation and electronics. These two businesses were impacted by weakness in end markets and channel inventory adjustments which further softened as we moved through the quarter. Asia-Pacific declined 4% in Q3, Japan's organic growth was up 3% with broad base strength across most of our businesses. Organic growth was down 9% in China driven by continued weakness in automotive, electronics and export related markets. For the year, we expect organic growth in China to be down mid single digits. EMEA grew 2% with positive growth across all businesses. Latin America, Canada grew 3% led by strong growth in Canada and Mexico. Please turn to Slide 7 for the third quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide third quarter sales were $8 billion, with operating income of $2 billion. Operating margins were 25.2% which included a 140 basis point benefit from the Q3 divestiture. Overall, I'm pleased that our actions to drive productivity continue to gain traction with strong underlying third quarter margins of nearly 24%. On the right hand side of the slide, you can see the breakdown of our third quarter margin performance. First, the biggest impact to Q3 margins was the year-on-year decline in organic volume, along with our actions to lower production volumes and reduced inventories to improve cash flow in the quarter. Partially offsetting these headwinds were benefits from the restructuring actions taken in Q2, as well as net gains related to property sales. In total, these factors resulted in a 160 basis point reduction to margins, versus last year's third quarter. Acquisitions and divestitures contributed a net 100 basis points to margins, primarily due to the gain from this quarter\u2019s divestiture, which was partially offset by the M*Modal acquisition. Higher selling prices continue to more than offset raw material inflation, contributing 30 basis points to third quarter margins. Well, selling prices came in a bit lower than expected, our sourcing efforts to reduced raw material costs resulting in a net benefit, which we expect to continue as we move forward. And finally, foreign currency net of hedging impacts increased margins by 80 basis points. Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at earnings per share. Third quarter earnings were $2.72 per share, which included a $0.14 benefit from this quarter\u2019s divestiture. Excluding this benefit, overall earnings were solid as the 3M team delivered strong operational performance. Looking at the components of our year-on-your earnings performance, the net impact of organic growth, inventory reductions and the other items that I covered on the prior slide, reduced third quarter per share earnings by $0.16. Acquisitions and divestitures combined increased third quarter earnings by $0.10 per share versus last year. Foreign currency net of hedging was an additional $0.05 per share tailwind in the quarter. Our third quarter underlying tax rate contributed $0.08 to per share earnings year-on-year. The lower rate is primarily a function of last year's tax reform and the benefits it created for U.S. based companies with a significant portion of their manufacturing in the U.S. And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 2.6% versus Q3 last year, which added $0.07 to per share earnings. Please turn to Slide 9 for a look at our cash flow performance. As Mike noted, we delivered very strong cash flow in the third quarter. Free cash flow was $1.7 billion with a conversion rate of 106% which included a negative 27 percentage point combined impact from the Q3 divestiture, and cash payouts of previously accrued respiratory related legal settlements. For the full-year, as a result of increasing cash flow, we are raising our expectations for conversion to a range of 105% to 110% versus 95% to 105% previously. Third quarter capital expenditures were $349 million and remain on track to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion for the year. During the quarter, we paid $828 million in cash dividends to shareholders and returned $142 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases. Please turn to Slide 10, where I'll summarize the business group performance for Q3. I will start with our safety and industrial business, which declined 3.3% organically in the quarter. Similar to the first half of the year, we saw continued end market softness and channel inventory reductions, which impacted most of our portfolio. Looking geographically, safety and industrial\u2019s organic growth was led by a 2% increase in EMEA and a 1% increase in Latin America, Canada. Well, the U.S. and Asia-Pacific each declined. Safety and industrials third quarter operating margins were 26.8%, which included a 3.9 percentage point benefit from the gas and flames detection divestiture. Overall underlying margins in this business were solid in the quarter when considering negative organic growth and inventory reductions. Moving to transportation and electronics. Third quarter sales were down 3.4% organically compared to last year. The electronics related businesses declined high single digits organically, as demand remains soft in consumer electronics, semiconductor and factory automation end-markets. Our automotive OEM business was down 3% in line with third quarter global car and light truck builds. Advanced Materials grew mid single digits organically well both transportation safety and commercial solutions each grew low single digits. Geographically, Latin America, Canada grew 7%, EMEA was up 1% organically. Well, the U.S. and Asia-Pacific each declined mid-single digits. Transportation and Electronics third quarter operating margins were 25.2% down 250 basis points. Similar to safety and industrial, margins were impacted by lower sales and inventory reductions. Turning to health care, the business delivered 2% organic growth in Q3. Organic growth was broad based across most of our health care business. Growth was led by a high single digit increase in Health Information Systems. We continue to invest in this business, including this year's acquisition of M*Modal, which recently launched a new AI clinical documentation software that provides real time insights to clinicians. Medical Solutions, our largest business in health care was up low single digits in the quarter. We are excited to have Acelity join this team, which Mike will cover shortly. Food safety grew organically mid-single digits with oral care up slightly. Separation and purification was down mid-single digits, primarily due to softness in China. Looking geographically, health care grew across each area. Health care's third quarter operating margins were 26.7% impacted by 1.5 percentage points from the M*Modal acquisition. Also impacting margins were inventory reductions, Acelity acquisition related costs and investments in priority growth platforms. Lastly, third quarter organic growth for our consumer business was nearly 3%. Sales were led by  mid-single digit growth in home improvement and low single digit growth in consumer health care. Well stationery and office and homecare declined. We saw continued strength in many of our leading brands in particular Filtrete, Command and Nexcare. Looking at Consumer geographically, EMEA, Latin America, Canada and the U.S. each grew low single digits, while Asia-Pacific declined. Consumers operating margins were 23.2% in the third quarter up slightly year-over-year. That wraps up our review of third quarter results. Please turn to Slide 11. And I'll hand it back over to Mike. Mike?\nMike Roman: Thank you, Nick. I would like to make a few comments about our acquisition of Acelity, which was finalized earlier this month. We are excited as we bring together two innovative companies focused on improving health care outcomes for patients. Acelity offers an impressive range of medical solutions, including their groundbreaking negative pressure wound therapy. They are an ideal fit within our health care portfolio, complementing our existing business and further accelerating 3M as a leader in advanced wound care, which is a significant and growing market. Acelity has annual revenues of $1.5 billion and year-to-date, they have delivered organic growth of 5% and EBITDA growth of more than 10%. We look forward to leveraging the fundamental strengths of 3M, especially our global reach and technologies to build upon these results and drive even greater value. We expect the acquisition to be $0.25 dilutive to GAAP EPS in the first 12 months or $0.35 accretive excluding purchase accounting and anticipated one-time expenses related to the transaction. We are pleased to welcome the talented people of Acelity to our 3M team and are confident in the value this acquisition will deliver to our customers and our shareholders. Please turn to Slide 12 where I will discuss our guidance. Today we are updating our guidance to incorporate the Acelity acquisition along with our expectation of continued softness in China, automotive and electronics. With one quarter remaining in the year, we are providing our guidance for Q4. We anticipate earnings in the range of $2.05 to $2.15 and an organic sales decline of 1% to 3%. On this slide, you will also see our updated full-year guidance for EPS and organic growth. Before turning to Q&A, I would like to make a few comments related to PFAS. We continue to proactively manage this issue. And I would like to provide some specific updates of what we have done since our last earnings call. As you may know in early September, we testified before Congressional Subcommittee in Washington D.C. We reminded the committee that the weight of scientific evidence does not show that PFAS cause adverse human health effects at current or historical levels. Opposition shared by public health agencies and independent science review panels. In our testimony we also announced a number of commitments that build upon our existing efforts related to PFAS including supporting new coordinated research into PFAS, establishing a clearinghouse to share best practices on detection, measurement and remediation, supporting nationwide science based regulation and continuing to work with former customers to help ensure that unused AFFF containing PFOS is properly handled. We also reaffirmed our commitment to ongoing remediation of our manufacturing facilities and historical disposal sites. With respect to litigation, the AFFF multi-district litigation is still in the early phases and at this time no trials have been scheduled. Outside of AFFF, the earliest we expect other product related trials to begin would be in the Spring of 2020. Moving forward, we will continue to keep you updated as developments unfold. In summary, as I look across our company, I see the strength of the 3M model. We have deep competitive advantages in our unique technology platforms, advanced manufacturing, global capabilities and leading brands. We also have experienced teams that know how to manage through macroeconomic slowdowns, which our businesses tend to see early. In these situations, we put an even greater emphasis on improving our operational performance and reducing costs, enabling us to generate strong cash flow as we did again in the third quarter. And throughout the business cycle, we remain focused on winning with our customers and keeping them at the core of everything we do, a great strength of the heart of the 3M culture. As a result, we are well positioned to lead out of this slowdown, and deliver strong growth and premium returns as our markets recover. Thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning guys.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Mike or Nick, can you give us more color into your revenue guidance for Q4, if you look at sales comps. They're reasonably close to Q3 and Q4, you are forecasting continued deceleration at the mid-point of your guide, so you are expecting some of your markets just still get worse in Q4 and could you give us some color by segments are the biggest changes there in safety and industrial, and then in health care, are you going to reach the high end of your range. And how much of that is the China slowing that you mentioned?\nMike Roman: Andy I would say when you look at Q3 versus Q4, Q4 has a very similar dynamic to Q3. You start with industrial production GDP, they're pretty much in line quarter-to-quarter. We, as I said in my remarks are still anticipating some that slowing in China automotive and electronics could continue through Q4. So that outlook continues to remain the same. I would say our view of Q4 is on the top line, much like Q3 and with a range around it. And then we are and our focus continues as you expect to focus on execution. There are growth opportunities, that 70% that has positive growth in Q3, there are growth opportunities there, so we're going to be pursuing those aggressively and there are much of health care as part of that.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Okay, Mike and maybe shifting gears, Nick, can you give us more color and how you're thinking about all the moving pieces around margin obviously good performance in the quarter, you got to around 23% in Q3 and you came in closer to 24% ex-divestiture. So you talked about second half restructuring, currency tailwind lessening impact from inventory destock. And then you've got the transformation optimization ramping up. So can you talk about which of these variables were better than expected? And if it's possible, could you give us some early color and how you're thinking about these variables into 2020?\nNick Gangestad: Okay, Andy, quite a bit you asked there. First of all, we are I am very pleased with our margin performance in Q3. When we strip out the gain on our divestiture nearly 24%, and we're seeing productivity actions that we\u2019re taking gaining traction. And at the same time, we're continuing to lower our production volumes and inventories with our focus on improving cash flow. So very pleased with that. Now when we look at what's going on in the margin performance itself in the quarter, there's about 150 basis points that we lay out that's negatively impacted from organic growth, inventory reductions and other items and about a third of that headwind is just directly related to the lower organic growth. And then the remaining two-thirds is tied in with our lower production on lowering our inventory levels. And it is partially being offset and being benefited by our restructuring actions, which are coming in exactly as we expected. And we also had a gain on a sale of some property that will just go into a little more depth on. We continue to do have a portfolio process where we're reviewing our assets that we have in place looking for are they optimal? And can we be moving to more cost effective operations, we continually do that. And then in the third quarter, we consummated a transaction disposing of an office building that resulted in a net benefit of about 50 basis points to our margin, or about between $0.06 and $0.07 per share. So those are the main things going on in the quarter from a margin perspective. If I as far as next year, Andy, I think it's really too early. We're so focused on delivering 2019. We'll give guidance on that in January.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: All right, thanks Nick.\nNick Gangestad: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning.\nMike Roman: Good morning, John.\nJohn Walsh: I guess, maybe going back to electronics and automotive markets, maybe even China as well, in the Q, you have the reported numbers, you kind of give us some direction on the local currency growth on the call, but are you actually seeing the second derivative start to improve in those end-markets. So if you look at some of the external data, electronic markets declines have kind of stabilized, at least where they are in terms of negatives and gotten a little bit better sequentially, auto could potentially flip next year as second derivative gets better, but can you talk specifically to your businesses and those that touch those markets, what you saw in the quarter?\nMike Roman: Sure John. Yes, just maybe kind of look across all those starting with automotive, so automotive the build rates are still negative and actually, I would say, the projections, they were worse than the projections maybe bit better than what we saw in the first half but still negative and so that was something that is an update to how we look at the second half of the year, I think we had a more conservative view of the overall projections. And so we are planning for this. We did see additional channel reactions to those negative build rates. We had talked about in the Q2 call that we thought a majority of the channel response to the decline in automotive and electronic more broadly took place in the first half of the year, but we did see some additional adjustments, a big part of that in I would say in China, but more broadly than that as well.  Electronics continued to be a drag in terms of end markets, they were negative growth as well. There's some signs out there that people are optimistic it\u2019s going to improve. We have some early indications that semiconductors is looking like it might start to improve. Certainly there's been some good consumer electronics, OEMs and brands that have talked about increasing sales. We've yet to see that necessarily play through the supply chain for us, but it's, I think the Q3, Q4, what I said earlier to Andy's comment, we see auto electronics and China kind of in line between Q3 and Q4. So we haven't seen that what we call a bottom and an upturn yet, although there are some signs in electronic side anyway, that there's an outlook for improvement coming.\nJohn Walsh: Okay, thank you for that. And then I guess as we think about at least the acquisitions and I know, you don't want to get into next year, but maybe we can talk about the underlying you're seeing in the back half this year, obviously M*Modal will flip from being a headwind to a tailwind based on your prior guidance for that business. We have Acelity coming in, but can you talk about the underlying health care business either in terms of incremental, if you were to take out all the noise, are you seeing anything different than history? Or maybe just help us understand what's going on there in an underlying basis?\nNick Gangestad: Hey, John, just to clarify you\u2019re talking about growth or margin when you're saying that?\nJohn Walsh: Sorry, on the margin side, on the margin side, because there's going to be a lot of noise in that margin number, particularly on Q4 through the acquisition dilution.\nNick Gangestad: Yes, thanks for clarifying that, John. So what we're seeing in health care, from year-on-year margin performance, the biggest thing as I said earlier is coming from our M*Modal acquisition and yes, that will start to flip next year. Other things going on there, we're continuing to invest in a number of priority growth platforms. If those are a number of growth platforms that you've seen us lay out and health care has a disproportionate amount of those and we continue to invest in that. We also in the current quarter is some investments we're making as we get ready for the Acelity, as we were getting ready for the Acelity acquisition, that that's, that's part of that. Just from a historical standpoint, we reorganized this business earlier this year, and added our separation purification business to be part of this. And I think, John, we restated and shared with those were on a restated basis for last year and the year before that, the health care business was operating on about a 28% operating income margin.\nJohn Walsh: Great, thank you for that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell, Barclays. Please proceed.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning.\nMike Roman: Hey, good morning.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: Good morning, maybe just starting with the health care division, not so much on the margin side, which I think you've clarified that maybe organic growth. So I think the organic growth year-to-date in health care is running at about 2%. Also, just wondered, when you're looking at that, maybe over the next 12 months, what are you expecting to accelerate that number and related to it separation purification rolled over, it sounded like having been flattish in Q2. How long do you expect that downturn to last and maybe tied to health care? The Acelity GAAP dilution has shrunk a bit versus what you said at the time of the deal. What drove that?\nMike Roman: So, Julian, I would start with just this remains a very attractive business, the end markets are very attractive with some strong growth trends, the demographics play well here. So, as we look forward, we see that as a strong growth driver for us. If you look in the quarter that the 2% growth, it was positive across nearly all of health care and it was led by good growth again in Health Information Systems and food safety, strong growers. Medical solution was up low single digits. The headwind that we faced with separation and purification, as you talked about, and that was primarily due to elevated channel inventories in a few areas of the world. And one of those is China, where we have a significant separation purification business, so that was the headwind, we did have both drug delivery and oral care. We're up slightly in the quarter and we expect drug delivery to continue to improve sequentially as we go forward and oral care continues to grow strongly, globally we saw some softness in the U.S. And we think the strength globally will carry us to better growth as we move ahead. So the overall markets have strong portfolio and the medical solutions business getting stronger with the integration of Acelity. By the way, the results in health information are reflecting some of the early synergies that we're getting from our M*Modal acquisition bringing those teams together that's really starting to play out in the market for us as well with our customers. So I think we do see it improving as we go into next year.\nNick Gangestad: And Julian in regards to the improved guidance that we're giving in regards to Acelity, we had previously said that in the first 12 months, we expected it to be $0.35 dilutive to GAAP earnings and we now expect it to be $0.25 dilutive in the first 12 months to GAAP earnings. That\u2019s $0.10 better EPS impact is primarily related to lower than expected financing costs. We saw interest rates from the time we announced that to when we actually obtained that financing improve. That's one piece and the most significant piece, we also are seeing better than expected EBITDA projections for that business than we were assuming back in May when we announced this deal.\nJulian Mitchell: That's good to hear. Thank you, Nick. Maybe one quick follow-up switching tack, just looking at the firm wide P&L for Q3. Very good performance on SG&A to sales coming in at 18%. Just wondered how much you thought that was sort of variable costs, or something temporary, like currency affecting that number or that ratio and how much is related to fixed cost reduction efforts that Mike you've been putting in place the last 12 months, and whether that sort of lower SG&A to sales run rate may be sustainable.\nNick Gangestad: If I look at this year-on-year, third quarter last year to third quarter this year, we're down about 80 basis points year-on-year. That's the combination of a couple of things. First of all, FX is not having a very material impact on that on as a percent of revenue, because it's, it affects both the numerator and the denominator, not a big change there. The two biggest things, Julian that are impacting that. One is the restructuring actions that we took in second quarter, we're seeing that benefit, the second and that that I see as sustained. The other thing that's impacting that is the gain we had on the sale of the building that I mentioned earlier, that that will not be a repeated action. It's about half and half.\nMike Roman: And Julian I would just as Nick said, we're executing well against our plan for the restructuring actions. Our teams are also responding to the dynamics that we see in the market and I think you see good operational and cost discipline as part of every business. So those are both playing through.\nJulian Mitchell: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin: Yes, good morning.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Andrew.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: And just a question, sort of another broad question on growth, as we think auto probably will remain a headwind, specifically North America and even if China bottoms into 2020. Just wondering, what kind of set of macro assumptions do we need for 3M to grow top line organically in 2020? Overall, I'm not asking for your forecast. But if you could just outline what's the baseline macro scenario that gets 3M growing in 2020? Thank you.\nMike Roman: Andrew I\u2019m probably not ready to get the forecast. But I would say what you talk through just automotive electronics and you think about broader across what we've been talking about in our businesses, absent a recession and or some other major downturn in the markets in 2020, we expect to have positive growth across the company. You'll see know, at least in a year-over-year comparable improvements, less headwinds in automotive and electronics. As I talked about earlier, we're seeing some early signs that we might have some upside in electronics going forward, though, that has to play out. Right, we are focused on Q4 and Q4 will tell us a lot about what to expect certainly in early 2020. But absent a recession, we expect to have positive growth.\nAndrew Obin: And just a follow-up on electronics, historically, you guys have been very good at calling out electronics a lot better than other suppliers into the industry. Seems it was one area of the shortfall in the quarter. Can you give us more specifics as to what sub segments within electronics end market. And I'm, looking at one of the slides where you give the full blown disclosure, what specific end markets or products drove deceleration of this quarter versus previous quarter? Thank you.\nMike Roman: Maybe I will talk about\u2026\nAndrew Obin: In 18, I\u2019m referring to Slide 18.\nMike Roman: Yes, I will talk about the four end markets in electronics broadly that are -- that we talked about when we talked about driving our growth, consumer electronics, we saw softness in that, continue to come through in Q3. Factory automation, there's no sign that that's turning around at this point, and that that also remains soft. Auto electrification, we saw lower build rates in Q3 in electric, in automotive electrification related platforms and make some models and so that was impacted by the overall auto build rate. And so that was that we still had some growth in our auto electrification portfolio, but not as strong as we had seen earlier in the year. And then semiconductor, I would say it declined into the quarter but as I said, there may be some early signs that we\u2019ll see that pick up as we go forward. So, that's kind of the view of the four. So literally three of them were soft in the quarter and our frame is to, that's the outlook for Q4 as well.\nAndrew Obin: Terrific. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Tusa: Hi guys.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Steve.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: So given you aren't going to do the kind of a year-end meeting, will there be a point where you guys kind of it just seems to me like a lot has changed since we last kind of sat down and walk through the strategy like a little less than a year ago. Will there be a time here in the next six months or so and certainly in the context of like maybe what you might learn on the PFAS front, where we'll kind of all get together and reset kind of the long-term view or are you still of the view that, steady as she goes, there's really no change to kind of the longer-term framework and algorithm you provided, last fall or winter, whatever that was in Minnesota?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Steve certainly the first year of our five year plan hasn't turned out as we anticipated, and given the slowdown in those key end markets, we've been talking about. We do have parts of our five year plan that are just as a reminder are doing well. We're on strong are on track for strong performance in free cash flow conversion and return on invested capital, but you're talking about growth when we look at growth in the outlook. Our Q4 earnings calls where we'll give an outlook for next year which is really the next indicator of where we are to get back on track with the longer five year plan. It's I think we are taking the right actions, I think it's early to today to give an update on the five year plan, but we'll be looking for the right time to do that as we come out of our guide for next year.\nSteve Tusa: Okay, so there's no like you're still kind of a, hey we'll see what happens here. And we may or may not reset that. I mean, is there a chance that you'd look at that? Or is there basically no chance that this is basically just a cyclical element in your first year and you will assume everything kind of bounced back?\nMike Roman: We\u2019re always looking at the long-term plan versus what we see in the markets, and I think as we get a better view of 2020 we will incorporate that and then we'll come back to.\nSteve Tusa: Okay, and then just one last thing on the -- on kind of the leverage the core underlying leverage. I mean, I appreciate you guys had you know some pretty significant inventory headwinds. It still seems to me, especially with the property sale, that there's a bigger decremental kind of volume impact even when you strip out the impact of inventories, is there anything that kind of changes that over the next couple of years? Are you guys spending more than you would otherwise be spending in kind of a tougher environment? I mean, how do we think about the type of growth you guys need to have, that kind of 40% incremental margin or some real leverage on the margin as things come back up because it looks to me like the decremental leverage remains a little bit tough when you strip out everything but volumes?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Steve when part of our year-on-year comparison is as you noted, aggressively pulling out inventory out of our own supply chain, we're estimating year-on-year that's having a 150 to 200 basis point negative impact on our margins. So to partly answer your question reaching a point of more stability on our amount of inventory in production that we have in our supply chain. That in itself is in the future going to start to create some of a tailwind to us when we\u2019ve depleted that inventory out. And by the way, we in our guidance here, we're estimating that we're going to take about another $50 million of inventory out of our supply chain in the fourth quarter.\nSteve Tusa: Okay, and then one last quick one on price cost? Is that that material benefit, that\u2019s kind of like, detached from volume, right? So like volume goes down, obviously your materials are going to go down, or is that how does that kind of reflect that dynamic? Just remind me about, just remind us of that?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, that's detached from volume. That's looking at what we're getting from prices versus what we're paying for our raw materials. And we really don't factor in a volume component to that.\nSteve Tusa: Yes, okay. Great, thanks for all the details. You guys were very helpful.\nNick Gangestad: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Inch: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, John.\nJohn Inch: I just want to pick up on the point of the year-end meeting, is this just a suspension for this year based on economy or an influx, or this permanently you're not going to hold these anymore? And so I'm actually curious, how do we get our gift bag of stocking stuffers?\nMike Roman: Well, John, it\u2019s definitely we think it's the right thing to do this year. So we have a really clear  view of what we saw in the quarter as we start the year. We think we can give a better outlook at the earnings call. We did it last year, too. And the dynamic was similar. We saw changes in the end markets coming and we thought it was a better place to give, I think just better quality outlook for the year. So we're going to do it again this year.\nJohn Inch: Yes, I don't disagree. Honestly, November last year was a little early. Just based on the way things were fluctuating, that is not really that much of a surprise. I do want to ask you though, the U.S. did seem to step down in the quarter kind of versus that trajectory and not sure that we're hearing that really from other companies. So I'm curious, kind of what's your read Mike and Nick, on the U.S., what kind of got worse? Was there some inventory? Is this transitory or, what's kind of going on in the underlying and Asia also seem to get a little worse too, but I think you sort of explained that with the additional inventory step down that kind of occurred in some of those end markets, but what's going on in the U.S.?\nMike Roman: Sure, John. IPI as I said earlier, IPI is kind of similar Q3 to Q4 worldwide, but the U.S. we saw significant decline in IPI and a revision down into third quarter and Q4 actually is projected to go negative. So you're seeing a broader impact on industrial production, broader manufacturing, we're certainly seeing that and that's impacting our safety and industrial business, our auto businesses is certainly caught up in that. We have good growth areas in much of health care. There's some segments, consumer and retail spending continues to be strong in the U.S. And there's some other segments like construction where we've seen significant growth opportunities, but that broader industrial manufacturing set of markets is weighing on the U.S. results. And then we saw with that slowdown, we saw additional channel actions in the quarter. And so that was part of what you saw coming through our numbers, especially our safety and industrial business.\nJohn Inch: And I'm assuming I mean, obviously, we all saw the September I assume print, I'm assuming everything you've seen thus far in October doesn't is the trend since September kind of more or less the same with respect to the United States or is there any other, is there any difference thus far realize that you still got another week to go but?\nMike Roman: Well, I would say as we've talked in the past channel tends to react pretty quickly. So we it's early days in October, we'll see if there's additional reaction there, but I think I would say what I said earlier that Q4 and Q3 kind of in line and October starting out as expected.\nJohn Inch: And then just lastly, Nick on the $0.35 of Acelity accretion, how much like how should we spread that there's obviously going to be some in the fourth quarter through the next four quarters. How would you spread that? And then what about the restructuring savings that we took in the second quarter from those actions? How much hit the third quarter? And how would you expect, again, sequentially the restructuring savings from your second quarter actions to play out?\nNick Gangestad: So the restructuring savings, just as a reminder, we expected an annualized benefit of $225 million to $250 million where we expect $110 million of that to be impact the second half of this year, and that's playing out as we expected and it's almost evenly split between Q3 and Q4. And then the balance of that we expect to benefit the first half of 2020. That that's in regards to the restructuring. As far as Acelity and now you're on to, you're not talking about the GAAP impact, but now from a $0.35 once we exclude the purchase accounting and the transaction and the integration costs, we expect that a large chunk of that's going to be hitting in Q4 right now, all we\u2019ve guided, we expect about $0.15 on a GAAP basis, but on a non-GAAP basis, we're not providing guidance yet. But of that $0.35, we will be seeing that more evenly spread over the next four quarters.\nJohn Inch: Maybe the point is the fourth quarter what how much of the fourth quarter been as Acelity, is that $0.15 of your fourth quarter guidance?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, from a GAAP perspective, it's a $0.15 headwind to us in the fourth quarter and then another $0.10 headwind in the first three quarters of 2020.\nMike Roman: Yes, John that is included in our guidance.\nJohn Inch: Yes, okay. All right, we will work details offline. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nMike Roman: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nMike Roman: Hey, good morning, Deane.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Hey, I\u2019d like to circle back. I know inventory has come up multiple times during this call. But maybe you can just clarify the interplay here, you're referring to customer channel inventory adjustments, and we've seen this multiple quarters now you called it out with safety and industrial, just because of lower demand, it gets reflected in your organic revenue growth. So we get that but then, as 3M, you're also taking inventory down. You did $180 million this quarter, you said there's another $50 million. The interplay between the two, how what inventory you actually taking down is all worth the result of lower customer demand? And then Nick, help us understand the cash flow impact as you liquidate this inventory?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Deane this is impacting our cash flow positively. And it's the single biggest driver, while you're seeing us increase our estimate of cash flow generation for the full-year, as we're realizing these benefits of reducing inventory within our own walls. Some of that is in response to what we're doing, responding to what we see a lower, lower demand right now. So that's, that's part of it Deane, but part of it is also that we're seeing opportunities for us to be managing our own supply chain more effectively. And that was part of what we've talked about for the last few years around business transformation. I would say we are starting to see some of that benefit. And that's part of the reason why we have this confidence that we can be bringing down our inventories and improving the cash flow as you're seeing.\nMike Roman: Deane, I would add that and we had a plan coming into the year to take down inventory significantly. And follow on to our go live in the U.S. last year, August. We have built inventory ahead of that. We talked a lot last year about what customers did Q2 to Q3, but we built inventory to manage through that. We didn't take all of that out by the end of 2018 and had a plan to do that in 2019. And so what you're seeing part of significant part of what we're doing is that plan and executing it while we see a slowdown and are having to manage our operations against that slowdown.\nDeane Dray: That clarification was very helpful. And just as a follow-up, I know there was some SG&A questions but it also looked like corporate costs came in lower. Was that all, was real estate gains there and then interest also looked lower and what were the dynamics there?\nNick Gangestad: The real estate gain that was all in corporate Deane, you're correct on that. As far as interest expense, the total net interest expense came in slightly lower and this will be the last what I'll say low quarter for a while be and this is part of the $0.15 guide. We're saying on Acelity because late in the quarter we issued more debt and we'll be seeing our interest expense increase in the fourth quarter. So we ran, I would say pretty steady interest expense over the last three quarters, we will be seeing that uptick in going into Q4.\nDeane Dray: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please proceed.\nScott Davis: Hi, good morning, guys.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Scott.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Davis: Is there any color you can give us an how the rating agencies view the PFAS overhang, do they circle a number around it and that's called one turn of debt or something like that and just, or is it just not? We're just not far along enough along on that yet?\nNick Gangestad: Scott, I described it as I'd say both our rating agencies as well as everything else -- everyone else on the equity side as well is interested in what that that will be, it's something they're watching, and monitoring just as we're monitoring, I'm sure same as your monitoring as well, but there's not a specific thing that I know of that they're building in their estimates for that for our rating.\nScott Davis: Okay, and I have and cycle timing is always tough, but you're taking down inventories now and then, presumably, sometime in 2020 things get better. I mean, is there a top line impact? Do you think missed orders or risk at all in the inventory plan? Or is it just or inventory so high that it's just, it's just not an issue?\nMike Roman: Yes, Scott, I would say, really what I was talking about this, this big part of our inventory actions this year are follow-on to our go-live in the U.S. and that we don't see that impacting our service. That's getting us back to where we should be. And I would say we what I highlighted in EMEA and Canada as we get deployed end-to-end, we actually see additional benefits and we can get more efficient and manage cycle times differently and days of inventory outstanding will go down and service will go up. And so we're seeing that kind of virtuous combination. So I don't nothing we're doing is putting at risk service. And I would say it's a indication that we're moving forward and getting a position to have better service at lower inventories.\nScott Davis: Are the customers holding less inventory to your mind?\nMike Roman: Well, when you go through distribution across a number of our models, they're all getting more efficient, they're driving out structure and cycle time as well. So I think some of what you see in inventory reductions in the channel is just them driving more efficient models. Big part of it this year is the slowdown in the end markets. But in general, I think you're seeing all supply chains get more efficient, at least the ones related to us. We are seeing them get more efficient inside our four walls and then with our channel partners as well.\nScott Davis: Okay, super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Joe.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: So maybe my first question, just touching on the decremental margins. I think, Nick in your prepared comments, you highlighted the good decremental in safety and industrial. And I'm just trying to figure out the divergence between the decrementals in that business versus the decrementals in the transportation and electronics business. And so any insight that you can provide on either how much of that is either mixed or end-market specific as to as opposed to how those businesses are being run, and how to think about those decremental margins moving forward?\nNick Gangestad: As far as the decrementals between SIBG versus TEBG that I think there's a lot of things in common, Joe actually more than what they're different where they're both seeing volume reductions impacting them as well as taking inventory. And as well as taking inventory out. On the TEBG side, there is also some mixed benefit that's impacting the TEBG numbers a bit more than the SIBG numbers, partly from the geographies in which TEBG sells as well as the businesses where we're seeing the growth versus negative growth this quarter.\nJoe Ritchie: So is it is it fair to assume that as things, things stay negative for the next couple of quarters? The decrementals then in the transportation and electronics business should remain kind of at pretty high levels. Whereas, you'll be you'll be able to manage safety and industrial a little bit better?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, over time Joe, as I'm sure you've observed this to TEBG will have higher incrementals and higher decrementals partly given the fixed asset base that we have there that when things are going up, we tend to see a lot more of that fall to the bottom line and when things are going down, we'll see more of that, that flow. So it'll tend, it will follow what's happening with our volumes in the coming quarters Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, fair enough. And then Mike, maybe one question for you, as you kind of think about things on a higher level, not too long ago, you guys performed a strategic review of the Health Information Systems business. I'm just wondering, given what we're seeing in the markets today, is there another thought to kind of look across the portfolio closer to see, if there's any opportunity from a divestiture standpoint?\nMike Roman: Joe, we are always evaluating our portfolio. It's an ongoing process. It's one of the things as we built to become a more active Portfolio Manager, it's really become an active ongoing process and we're focused in that, as I've shared in the past that we're focused on optimizing the value of our portfolio, on an ongoing basis and looking at everything from what we do with our organic investments to where we focus our acquisitions, and what we do with to optimize all parts of our portfolio, including divestitures. And we showed examples, again, where we were, when we identified parts of our portfolio that we could create greater value by divesting them, we're ready to take those actions. So I think it's, I think of it as a very active portfolio pipeline on an ongoing basis and something we top priority for us.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, good morning.\nMike Roman: Hey Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Hey, Nick, could we just go back to the inventory impacts. I think you said 150 and 200 basis points. So was that $150 million, $200 million, please clarify that?\nNick Gangestad: That was 150 to 200 basis points impact based on our year-on-year change in inventory levels and throughput that we're putting to our factories.\nNigel Coe: Yes, okay, can we just dig into that because that implies a $500 million gross margin impacts, just based on the 150 on revenues. And theoretically, that comes back in 2020, as you think about inventories, but it seems like apples for apples, you\u2019re cutting inventory by about $400 million excluding disposals. So I'm just wondering how on earth, it can be as big as that impact just because of the fixed costs absorption. So maybe just kind of clarify that point please.\nNick Gangestad: So Nigel, part of that analysis is looking at how much we built inventories in the third quarter of 2018 compared to how much we reduced inventories in the third quarter of 2019. And in the third quarter of 2018, we were still building inventories fairly substantially. And that's now slipped. So all of that 150 to 200 will not pull forward into 2020 because some of it is a statement on the benefits we were getting in 2018.\nNigel Coe: Got it. Okay, that helps. We'll take it offline on that one as well. And then you kind of alluded to this in the answer to I think Joe's question on the geographic mix location of the sales and you're growing in EMEA, which is your lowest margin regions still, you\u2019re declining heavily in Asia, which is your highest margin, so maybe just address the mix impacts that you\u2019re seeing right now on margins?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, so some of our businesses and that as we look geographically, Asia-Pacific is one of our higher margin places. And EMEA is one of our lower margin places, so geographic mix is having an impact on us. On the EMEA side, you're accurate in saying, it is our lower margin parts of the world. However, I will point out and thanks for bringing that up. We've been on a journey of rate increasing our margins there. And we are very pleased with the progress we've been making in 2019 on our progression to moving our West European margins up to 20%. 2019 has been a substantial step towards reaching that by 2020. And we were highly confident will be there by next year.\nNigel Coe: Got it. And then just one quick one, Nick, on the FX hedge the eight basis points of impact this quarter. How does that evolve going into 2020? Do we flip into a slight negative in 2020 means any views on that?\nNick Gangestad: It depends on whether you're asking about margin or EPS. We continue to have a number of unrealized gains that if currencies stay where they are. We'll see those gains flowing through in the next two years from our hedging. Right now, I'm not willing to say whether I think it's going to be a benefit or not because there's just too much volatility in the FX market to say but if you look at our 10-Q that we\u2019ll be issuing, we lay out here is the amount of unrealized FX hedging gains that we will unwind in the next year or two.\nNigel Coe: Fair enough. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nLaurence Alexander: Good morning. Just one last inventory question. On the last call, you reduced inventory by about $70 million more than in Q3, but the margin impact was about 50 basis points less, is there -- is that what just simply because of the year-over-year comparison issue that you're speaking of or is that also because of which business lines you were reducing inventory in?\nNick Gangestad: No, Laurence, it's solely a function of the comp that we're going against in 2018.\nLaurence Alexander: Okay, and then just to clarify the 200, 150 to 200 basis points, I think what that Nigel was referring to. I think some of the questions on the call I have framed it has a year, as a full-year impact. Is it a full-year impact or is it just a Q3 impact?\nNick Gangestad: That was just a Q3 comments on the impact it's having on our total margin.\nLaurence Alexander: Okay, thank you.\nNick Gangestad: Yes.\nMike Roman: Thanks Laurence.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.\nMike Roman: To wrap up, I am pleased with our team's progress in the third quarter, which demonstrates the strength of the 3M model and our ability to perform across the business cycle. Moving forward, we are focused on delivering greater value for our customers and shareholders building on the momentum from our execution and results in Q3, driving strong cash flow and improving growth. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does concludes the conference call for today.

Welcome to the 3M Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, July 25, 2019. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2019 business review. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Nick will make some formal comments, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Today\u2019s earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading, Quarterly Earnings. Please note we are reporting our results under our new business group structures starting with the second quarter. Additional business group performance details can be found in the appendix of this presentation along with our May 30th, 8-K and our Investor Relations website. Lastly, let me remind you and mark your calendars for our third quarter earnings call which will take place on Thursday, October 24th. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 2. During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Finally, please note that throughout today\u2019s presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in particular, measures which exclude the impact of the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation and press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and I\u2019ll hand it off to Mike. Mike?\nMike Roman: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am encouraged by our company\u2019s progress and performance in the second quarter, coming off a difficult to start to the year. While we continued to face slow growth conditions in key end markets, our execution was strong. We implemented our restructuring while effectively managing costs and reducing inventory levels, which I will discuss on the next slide. Our team is building momentum going into the second half as we focused on what we control and as a result today we are affirming our guidance for the full year. At the same time, we remain focused on our four priorities for long-term value creation, portfolio, transformation, innovation and people and culture. In the second quarter, this included our acquisition of Acelity, an excellent complement to our health care portfolio and which we expect to close in the fourth quarter. Please turn to Slide 4. As you recall on our last earnings call, we laid out specific and aggressive actions to strengthen our performance. In the second quarter, we made significant progress with each of those actions. First, the restructuring has been finalized across the enterprise, which resulted in a pre-tax charge of $148 million. We continue to expect annual savings of $225 million to $250 million with $110 million in the remainder of this year. Beyond the restructuring, we are driving increased cash flow through several other actions. For example, we adjusted our manufacturing output and reduced inventory levels by over $250 million in the quarter. We also curtailed indirect costs by more than $80 million year-over-year. While we are making positive strides in our operations, there is still more to do and we will remain focused on managing costs and improving productivity. As we do this, we will continue to invest in organic growth, the research and development and CapEx to deliver on our promise to innovate for our customers. Please turn to Slide 5 for a summary of our second quarter. Organic growth companywide was minus 1% in line with our expectations. Growth was led by our Health Care business at 4% which was a good improvement versus Q1 and consumer grew 1%. We saw continued end market softness in China, automotive and electronics, which tempered growth in our other two businesses. Growth in Safety and Industrial declined by 5%, while Transportation and Electronics was down 1%. With respect to EPS, we posted adjusted earnings of $2.20 per share, which includes a $0.21 charge for restructuring and a $0.07 benefit from a pending divestiture, which Nick will cover in his remarks. Underlying margins were 22.2% which excludes 140 basis points of impact from the restructuring. So we are making good progress relative to our Q1 margins, up 21.4%. Importantly, we delivered this improved margin performance even while reducing production and inventory, which reflects the strength of the 3M value model. I wanted to take this opportunity to thank our people for rising to the occasion and for executing our plans with focus and urgency. And while there is more work left to do, 3M\u2019s foundation remains strong. We have deep competitive advantages [indiscernible] advanced manufacturing, global capabilities and leading brands. We have market leading businesses and strong relationships with our customers. Moving ahead, we are focused on investing for the future and continuing to deliver operational improvements which will enable us to better serve our customers and maximize value for all of our stakeholders. That wraps up my opening comments. I will come back to discuss our guidance after Nick takes you through the details of the quarter. Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 6. Second quarter organic sales declined 0.9% in line with our expectations. Volumes were down 140 basis points while selling prices were up 50 basis points. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increased sales by 10 basis points. While foreign currency translation was a 180 basis point headwind to sales. All in, second quarter sales in U.S. dollars declined 2.6% versus last year. Looking at growth geographically, the U.S. was flat organically versus last year\u2019s 6% comparison. Last year\u2019s second quarter was boosted by increased customer demand ahead of our U.S. ERP go-live. Health Care grew mid single digits with Consumer up low single digits. Transportation and Electronics was flat while Safety and Industrial declined. Asia Pacific declined 90 basis points in Q2 with Health Care delivering positive mid single digit organic growth [indiscernible] while each organic growth in China was down 80 basis points with growth in Health Care and Transportation and Electronics, which was more than offset by declines in Safety and Industrial and Consumer. For the year, we now expect organic growth in China to be down low to mid single digits versus a prior expectation of flat. As we continue to experience challenging end market conditions, particularly in the electronics and automotive industries. EMEA declined 3.6% on a nearly 6% comparison in last year\u2019s second quarter. Latin America/Canada grew 70 basis points with Brazil, Canada, and Mexico each up low single digits. Please turn to Slide 7 for the second quarter P&L highlights. Companywide, second quarter sales were $8.2 billion with operating income of $1.7 billion. Operating margins were 20.8% which included a 140 basis point impact from our second quarter restructuring and other actions. As anticipated, the biggest impact to Q2 operating margins was the year on year decline in organic volume along with cost absorption penalties from lower production volumes as all business groups work to reduce inventories in the quarter. These factors resulted in a 200 basis point reduction to margins versus last year\u2019s second quarter. Acquisitions and divestitures combined brought down margins by 50 basis points primarily due to the acquisition of M*Modal. Higher selling prices continued to more than offset raw material inflation contributing 30 basis points to second quarter margins. For the year, we continue to expect selling prices to more than offset raw material costs. And finally foreign currency net of hedging impacts increased margins by 40 basis points. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at earnings per share. Second quarter adjusted earnings were $2.20 per share. That was a bit better than we anticipated, primarily due to improved productivity along with the held for sales status related to a pending divestiture, which I will cover shortly. Let me now cover the reconciling items to second quarter earnings. Negative organic growth along with absorption penalties from lower production and inventory levels reduced per share earnings by $0.19 [indiscernible] divestitures combined increased second quarter earnings by $0.01 per share versus last year. This result includes a $0.07 tax benefit related to the held per sales status of the pending divestitures of the gas and flame detection business that we announced in June. Restructuring and other actions lowered Q2 earnings per share by $0.21. Our second quarter underlying tax rate was higher year on year, which decreased earnings by $0.07 per share. And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% versus Q2 last year, which added $0.07 to per share earnings. Please turn to Slide 9 for a look at our cash flow performance. Second quarter free cash flow was $1.2 billion with a free cash flow conversion rate of 110% which includes a 14 percentage point benefit from the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary. Second quarter capital expenditures were $421 million, up $56 million year-on-year. For the full year, we continue to anticipate CapEx investments in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. During the quarter, we paid $830 million in cash dividends to shareholders and returned $400 million to shareholders through growth share repurchases. We continued to expect full year repurchases to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. Please turn to Slide 10, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q2. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business which declined 5% in the quarter. Similar to first quarter, we saw continued broad based softness and channel inventory reductions across most of the portfolio. These factors particularly impacted our automotive aftermarket, abrasives and closure and masking systems businesses. Personal safety was up low single digits in Q2 against the double digit comparison a year ago. And roofing granules turn positive this quarter, growing low single digits organically. Looking geographically, Safety and Industrial\u2019s organic growth was led by a 1% increase in Latin America/Canada, well Asia Pacific, EMEA and the U.S. each declined. Safety and Industrial\u2019s second quarter operating margins were 22.1% with an underlying decline of approximately 200 basis points. Margins were impacted by negative organic growth, reductions in manufacturing output and inventory along with our second quarter restructuring actions. Moving to Transportation and Electronics. Second quarter sales were down 120 basis points organically compared to last year. The electronics-related businesses were down low single digits organically with growth in display materials systems more than offset by declines in electronics materials solutions. Our automotive OEM business was down 5% year on year impacted by a 7% decline in second quarter global car and last year strong comp. Transportation safety was up mid single digits and advanced materials continued to deliver strong organic growth up high single digits in the quarter. Geographically, organic growth was flat in both the U.S. and Latin America/Canada, well Asia Pacific and EMEA declined. Transportation and Electronics second quarter operating margins were 24.1%, down 240 basis points. Similar to Safety and Industrial, margins were impacted by manufacturing and inventory reductions along with a 30 basis point impact from restructuring. Turning to Health Care, as anticipated, this business improved versus first quarter as our team delivered 3.5% organic growth in Q2. Organic growth was broad across most of our Health Care business, led by a high single digit increase in health information systems. Medical solutions, our largest business in Health Care was up mid single digits and we continue to look forward to Acelity becoming part of this business later this year, up low single digits.  Finally, drug delivery was down mid single digits in line with our expectations. On a geographic basis, Asia Pacific and the U.S. led the way each up mid single digits. Health Care second quarter operating margins were 26.4% which included a combined 210 basis point impact from the M*Modal acquisition and restructuring. Lastly, second quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was nearly 1%. Sales grew low single digits in Consumer Health Care, stationery and office and home improvement. While home care declined. Looking at Consumer geographically, organic growth was led by a 2% increase in the U.S. and Latin America/Canada, while Asia Pacific and EMEA declined. Consumers operating margins were 20.6% in the second quarter which included a 40 basis point impact from restructuring.  That wraps up our review of second quarter results. Please turn to slide 11 and I\u2019ll hand it back over to Mike to discuss 2019 guidance. Mike?\nMike Roman: Thank you, Nick. Today, we are affirming our guidance for the full year. We expect organic growth of minus one to plus 2% along with adjusted earnings of $9.25 to $9.75 per share. Please note that this guidance does not include the pending Acelity acquisition or the pending divestiture of our gas and flame detection business. We also continue to expect a return on invested capital of 20% to 22%. And a free cash flow conversion rate of 95% to 105%. While there is uncertainty in the global macroeconomic environment, we are maintaining our guidance, as we will see continued momentum from the actions we implemented in the first half.  [Indiscernible] PFAS, specifically, PFOA and PFOS, which are the subject of a litigation we face. As CEO, there are few things that I want people to know about this issue and our company. First, 3M voluntarily phased out of the production of PFOA and PFOS in the early 2000s and was the first company to do so. Since then, we have been committed to using our expertise and resources to improve the knowledge of PFAS, support remediation and give people confidence in their water. 3M has invested $100 million in testing water sources. We have invested another $50 million for filtration systems as these substances can be effectively removed, which 3M has been doing for more than a decade. We have entered into voluntary agreements with states and communities where we manufactured these compounds. We have also contributed to peer-reviewed journals, backed by hundreds of studies conducted by 3M and other researchers on the potential effects of PFAS. At the same time, we are continuing to work with the EPA along with state and local governments to support thoughtful regulations and solutions based on science and facts. We also believe that an independent scientific body should partner with regulators to review all available [indiscernible] continues to evolve. The scientific evidence does not show that PFAS caused harm to people at past or current exposure levels. More broadly speaking, being an environmentally responsible company is core to 3M. We started our groundbreaking Pollution Prevention Pays program more than 40 years ago and we continue to step up our leadership to address climate and environmental challenges. Earlier this year, we committed to move our entire global operations to renewable energy. And last year alone, 3M solutions helped our customers avoid 15 million tons of emissions. Sustainability is a value that matters deeply to our people, to our customers, and to me personally. It is a point of pride for 3M and we will defend with vigor our company\u2019s reputation in the court of law and in the court of public opinion. That concludes our prepared remarks and we\u2019ll now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning guys.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Andy.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Andy.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Mike or Nick, can you talk about the cadence of the quarter as it went on? Some industrial companies have talked about a bit of a stabilization late in Q2, did you see that at all in Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, and last quarter you said these stockings from your customers cost you something like a 100 basis points of revenue growth was similar impact in Q2 as it does look like your auto OEM business performed a bit better than the underlying market. So have you seen any signs of industrial or auto destocking this closer to ending?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Andy. Throughout the quarter, the trends were pretty stable as we saw our sales progress through each of the three months. I can\u2019t say we really discerned any positive or negative trend as the quarter progressed. If I shift it internally, we did see our momentum in terms of reducing in regards to channel inventory I said about last quarter about 100 basis points of what we impacted channel destocking. We were again seeing channel destocking impacting us in the second quarter in particular in the SIBG business, safety and industrial business group. We think that was a very similar destocking impact to what we saw in the first quarter and as far as automotive, we were in most noticeably impacted by destocking in China and that just was not the same event in the second quarter. It was a pretty much more normal relation of auto builds to our penetration and less channel destocking going on in relation to auto.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Okay. Nick, that\u2019s helpful. And then you mentioned in the presentation that you\u2019ll save $110 million in the second half of the year $0.15. It will help to have a decent step-up in EPS in the second half even outside the benefit to make the midpoint of your guide. So how much of the step-up is in your control? Can you give us some more color on how much of your business transformation and stocking optimization initiatives can help you in the second half? I think there'll be programs in terms of savings that are continuing to ramp in second half and in 2020.\nNick Gangestad: Yes. Andy, a few things are going on. First of all, we have been progressively taking more and more inventory out of our own operations. We think some of that that\u2019s going continue into the second half of the year. So that will continue to be a headwind that we are facing in the second half of the year. We will be getting the restructuring benefits of $0.15 that we talked about as well as I\u2019ll just say overall disciplined cost management in light of what we would call a slowing economy right now. So some of that our own discipline in execution will be impacting us in the second half. On the margin, there are some other things that will impact us. FX, which has been a neutral to a headwind in the second \u2013 in the first half of the year, that will be likely if FX rates stay where they are, that they will be coming positive to us in the second half of the year. But mainly it\u2019s just going to be improved execution over what we saw in particularly in the first quarter.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Thanks Nick.\nNick Gangestad: Thanks Andy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Joe.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey Nick. Maybe just kind of staying on the \u2013 how to think about the margins for the rest of the year, obviously, like a big headwind this quarter was the manufacturing and inventory reductions. And you guys have given some estimates for what you expect, productivity to be like this year and clearly, you are also moving ahead with indirect cost reduction. So I don't know, is the right way to think about it as you progress through the year that these things are going to offset each other? Or should we be thinking about them as a tailwind? I'm just trying to understand how to think this through.\nNick Gangestad: Joe, if I think about where we are going to end for the full year, let me just start out by saying when I look at collectively where all the sell-side analysts are in their view of the total year. My view is it looks like you collectively have it dialed in about right. What I\u2019m seeing collectively amongst all of you means it lines up very closely with our own internal view of how things will progress for the full year. If I look at in particular in Q3, Joe, right now we are expecting organic growth in the second quarter to be somewhere between flat to a low single digit organic growth. And as far as margins, what we\u2019ve been seeing happen throughout the year and what we expect to continue to happen as we progress into Q3, Q1 to Q2, absent the restructuring actions, was a sequential improvement in margins as we focus on execution. We think that sequential improvement going into Q3 is going to continue. So we expect our margins to be 23% or higher in the third quarter. And so what we are seeing there is some momentum building on our margin story. And so I'd say, Joe, those are the headlines to think about and how you are thinking about the second half of the year.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. That\u2019s super helpful, Nick. And I guess maybe, Mike, very, very helpful, commentary earlier on PFAS. I guess just as \u2013 obviously, it's hard to assess how this all shakes out, but I\u2019d be curious to get your views on like timing on when we could think about when we\u2019ll start to get some sort of resolution, as it continues obviously to be a bit of an overhang on the shares?\nMike Roman: Yes. Joe, I wouldn't think about timing. In respect to timing, let me kind of talk about what we can say today. And it's not a lot, but it\u2019ll give you a couple of things to look at. The first trial, if there is a trial, related to the Wolverine cases in Michigan that would be at the end of first quarter. These are kind of fuzzy time lines. They're not fixed. But that's kind of the expectation when the first trials related that if there is a trial would come to us. AFFF, the MDL, the multi-district litigation, we wouldn't expect any actions on that until late 2020. So those are kind of a frame of the litigation and timing. And as we learn more \u2013 as I said in my comments, we're gaining and understanding all the time. And as we learn more, we\u2019ll update you as we go.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of Merrill Lynch, please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin: Good morning. Can you hear me?\nMike Roman: Yes good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Yes. Just a couple of follow-up questions. Could you just walk us through core gross margins ex restructuring sequentially versus the first quarter and how should we think about progression on that side of the equation through the year? Thank you. That\u2019s the first question.\nNick Gangestad: Okay, Andrew. A little bit of this will be a repeat from what I said to Joe, but our core underlying margins\u2026\nAndrew Obin: Gross margin, yes.\nNick Gangestad: Gross margin. Thank you for clarifying that Andrew. So our gross margins in the first quarter if we pull out the costs related to some litigation activity that we had in the first quarter, our core underlying gross margin was 48%. In the second quarter that went down. If I pull out the restructuring down to 47.5%, and that's being impacted, we think we estimate by a 100 basis points to 150 basis points in the second quarter by the aggressive actions we're taking and pulling out inventory in our production. So underlying operations, we're seeing good execution on what we're working there. And we expect those gross margins to continue to be impacted by us taking actions on our inventory. But we also do see our gross margins improving slightly into the third quarter.\nAndrew Obin: So if we pull that out, just to clarify, if we pull that out, you're sort of recovering slowly from that 48% into sort of more historical range of 49%, 50%. That's a fair statement if you take out inventory,\nMike Roman: Andrew that's a fair statement.\nAndrew Obin: And then on inventory, I assume that improved free cash flow forecast for the, I think, it's Slide 23 upon Slide 24, that's all working capital, right?\nMike Roman: Yes, we\u2019re keeping our projection of free cash flow conversion. Well I think you're actually going into a deeper slide. Improved working capital is the biggest thing impacting our free cash flow conversion and dollars for 2019.\nAndrew Obin: And if you were to quantify how much incremental working capital reduction opportunities do you have for the next 12 to 18 months?\nMike Roman: I'll isolate it just to inventory, right now, Andrew, in answering that question, 250 that we took out in the second quarter, we think there's another $100 million or $200 million that we can be taken out of the second half of 2019. And then as far as 2020, it's a little early to say, but we've been targeting to get down to 85 days of inventory outstanding. That's where we're targeting to get to the end of this year. If we're going to bring that down further in 2020, I\u2019ll likely be giving that guidance later in this year or early next year.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Thank you.\nNick Gangestad: Hey Julian.\nMike Roman: Hey Julian.\nJulian Mitchell : Hi. Maybe just focusing on Q3, so I think you talked about flat to slight organic sales growth firm wide. Maybe just help with a couple of aspects of that. One would be, does that assume further channel destocking and how severe would that be in Q3? Not your own under production efforts, but that channel destock. And then what are you assuming for the Transport and Electronics business within that, after what was a pretty good Q2?\nMike Roman: It's probably good to step back. I recognize we've been seeing, the global economies slowing as we came through second quarter, but this is a trend that we've been seeing since late last year. And I would say if you look at now third quarter as we move sequentially forward to deliver on what Nick was just talking about, it really is a stabilization of the markets that we\u2019re facing and the trends that we\u2019re seeing. And to go below that it would have to \u2013 the economies would have to degrade even further. And if you look at channel Nick talked about what we saw in the second quarter relative to the first quarter, we think when you look at the total year as it plays out a majority of the inventory adjustments in the channel are taking place in the first half. So it will be a lesser impact even though there\u2019ll be some impact in the second half. So that plus a easier comp as you get into Q3 if you look at it with our ERP deployment last year that would all add up to that trend. And just on your question about TBG we would see them down in the second half from where they are in \u2013 sequentially from where they are in second quarter. But in line with the market outlook that we\u2019ve talking we don\u2019t \u2013 I think early in the year people had been talking about, been hoping for a stronger recovery in automotive and electronics. But we see a more conservative view of that now with build rates down and continuing to be soft as we go into second half may be stabilizing a bit versus where they are in the second quarter, but still down. So we see sequentially down in TBG.\nJulian Mitchell : Thank you.\nNick Gangestad: Hey Julian just to add a little bit what Mike said there for Transportation and Electronics in the third quarter particularly, we expect that to be down low to mid-single digits in the third quarter. And that\u2019s in line with what we\u2019re expecting as far as guidance for the full year for Transportation and Electronics. We\u2019ve guided that we think for the full year that somewhere between flat to down 3%. And if I had to estimate right now, I'd say we're much \u2013 we\u2019re leaning more towards the low end of that range for Transportation and Electronics for the full year.\nJulian Mitchell : That's extremely helpful. Just following-up on that Nick, as you said, that's trending towards the lower end. Also I think from a regional standpoint you took down your China assumption for the year. So maybe help us understand in the context of the overall reaffirmed organic sales growth guide for 3M for 2019 which of the regions or segments that are coming in maybe at the higher end or looking a little bit brighter today than back in April?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, so healthcare as far as the guidance that we've given for the full year on that, that's when we see more likely in the high end of the range; and Transportation and Electronics more likely towards the low end; Consumer. I'd put right in the middle of the range that we've laid out. And the SIBG we see it in the range, but that also could be in this bottom half of the range. And as we guided a negative one to plus two for the full year, last quarter and as we're affirming it, there was also a sense that we had there may be some places where things come in a little weaker and we're seeing that happen and that gives us the ability to continue to maintain that guidance, going forward.\nJulian Mitchell : Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning.\nNick Gangestad: Hi, Nigel.\nMike Roman: Hi, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Hi. Just want to keep kind of follow-on that one really. Just kind of think about what the all means to that minus one plus two. So, it seems like you sort of biased in towards slightly below the midpoint based on what you see today, would that be fair, Nick, sort of looking at maybe flat to up slightly for the full year?\nNick Gangestad: Yes Nigel, I mean the midpoint of that range is up 50 basis points, so flat to up 50 to a 100 basis points, like that's I think of very fair zone for where our most likely landing spot is.\nNigel Coe: Okay, that's helpful. I'm not sure I missed some of the prepared remarks. Did you quantify the impacts of inventory headwind this quarter? So that down 90 bips, what was the sell through that you saw, excluding inventory headwinds?\nNick Gangestad: Now there's, Nigel, there's two different inventory points we talked about on channel inventory contractions that last quarter in the first quarter we said it was about a 100 basis point impact to revenue. We think second quarter was something similar to that. And Mike also clarified that we think well we still have some ahead of us for channel contraction, we think the majority is behind us. In terms of within our company as we have been reducing inventories ourselves, reducing our production, we've said that \u2013 I've said that we think that impacted our margin in the second quarter by a 100 basis points to 150 basis points.\nNigel Coe: Okay. That's very clear. Thanks for the detail. And my follow-on question is really on the location and implications of some of the one time of this quarter. There was $0.07 tax gain, did that land in the tax line or was that somewhere else Nick? And then secondly, the restructuring is 1.12 operating, 3.6 non-operating. The payback was based on $0.20 of restructuring. Is that the right way to think about it or does the payback sort of come down because some of it is non-operating and maybe just touch on the nature of that non-operating restructuring charge.\nNick Gangestad: Okay, Nigel I\u2019ll just parse out the two pieces you're asking about, the $0.07 benefit we incurred in relation to the held for sale status for our Gas Detection business, that ran through the tax line, the income tax line of our income statement. The $148 million impacting our operating expense and the balance $36 million of non-op. And that's exactly in line with what we were expecting. We were estimating approximately $150 million. The fact that some of it is hitting non-op versus operating doesn't impact at all the projected benefits we have going forward of approximately $110 million yet this year and on an annualized basis, $225 million to $250 million. As far as where that restructuring happened, I would say geographically it happened around fairly well dispersed around 3M. And as far as business of the $112 million that was in operating expenses of that restructuring, about 75% of that was in our corporate and unallocated section, and about 25% of that was in our businesses. Now the benefit, that $110 million of benefit, that will be felt by our businesses through the second half of the year and it will be fairly proportionate to the size of each of our businesses as far as the benefits that you\u2019ll see in the second half.\nNigel Coe: Great. Thanks Nick.\nOperator: Alright, next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi. Good morning guys.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Nick, just a point of clarification on the inventory de-stock that you saw externally by your customers. You said that 100 basis points in the first quarter kind of look similar in the second quarter. But auto, I think, China auto specifically got better. So within that something must have gotten worse. Where did we see that get worse?\nNick Gangestad: As far as anything that got sequentially worse versus the first quarter Josh, nothing comes out particularly strong. I think in aggregate in China we continue to see China destocking on a more broad basis. So we didn't see it in our automotive business of any significance. What we saw across our Safety and Industrial business that view Josh was very similar in terms of the total destocking impact that we were seeing of a 100 basis points both quarters.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then I know it's a little early to think about 2020 but I guess thinking back with historical context for how destocking and re-stocking cycles go, should we expect to just be selling to kind of market demand as we get to the end of this? Or presumably in China there's kind of a bit of rational exuberance on both sides of the equation that as soon as things turn destock turns into restock. Has that historically been the case or should we just think about 2020 starting point as, hey, maybe we will lose some of that destocking headwinds?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Josh, maybe a couple things. If you look at the channel and I would say the value chains, customer value chains, they react to the dynamics in the end markets pretty quickly. What you saw in the destocking the first half, they were reacting quickly to the build rates and automotive electronics. We expect that to stabilize in the second half. We'll see some additional destocking because of some of the slowing that we saw in second quarter, but it'll stabilize. So really to start to think about what happens in 2020 or even late in the year, it will depend on the end market dynamics. If they recover and their demand goes up, then you would see a pretty strong turnaround in restocking. But if it stabilizes and the projections and outlooks economically are more stable in the second half, then it would be balanced as we get into the second half. And then it depends on what happens in demand as we go into 2020.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then just to follow-up on business transformation and the savings associated with that. Obviously there's a lot of moving pieces in the organization right now with restructuring, and some of the demand dynamics and the internal destocking. How are you benchmarking on some of the business transformation savings and kind of non-savings related kind of other benefits that would happen throughout the organization? Is that's something where those kind of go by the wayside or harder to execute on? Just an update on how that track. \nMike Roman: Yes we've always talked about transformation as a focus that starts and ends with a customer. But it is really making us more agile, more efficient and more competitive and that that creates value, all of those create value. And it also helped us realign the company around the four businesses, the go-to-market models of customers that we have. So it's enabling us to connect our customers even better as we move ahead. And it's a lot more than an ERP deployment. It's the entire ecosystem around that and it's digitizing our enterprise. All of that's adding efficiency. And so we are committed to the savings that we talked about at the beginning, it\u2019s the value realization that we would have by the end of 2020. But it does help us drive productivity. It does help us become more efficient broadly. And we talked about how that starts to show up in our margins over time. It's an enabler for us to continue to create premium margins as we move ahead. So it is going to be a driver of the savings that we've talked about, but also of that efficiency that will carry us forward.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: All right. Thanks guys.\nNick Gangestad: Yes thanks Josh.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, good morning.\nMike Roman : Good morning Steve.\nNick Gangestad : Good morning.\nSteve Tusa: The $0.07 of the tax benefit, I mean my tax line was relatively in line. Was there then a kind of a higher than expected effective tax rate and does that sustain itself? And also is that a $0.07 benefits kind of now in a run rate per kind of quarter here, or is that just kind of a onetime discreet item?\nNick Gangestad : Steve first of all, it's a \u2013 let me just describe it in a little bit of detail. The gas detection business that we own is in a position where we plan to sell it and the tax basis that we're holding that asset at is greater than the plan selling price. But it's also the book value of what we hold with that asset is below the plant's selling price. So when we sell it, we will take an operating income capital gain on that. But from a tax perspective it will be a loss. Now I'm a bit over my skis here describing accounting nuances to you, but the accounting rules are, once you place this asset in a held for sales status if it's in a tax loss position, you take the tax benefit immediately even before the deal actually concentrates. So that $0.07 is a result of us putting it in that status. So that's not an ongoing repeating thing that will be seen. As far as the underlying operations, no see there's not any big one thing offsetting that. There's always little nips back and forth in the tax rate. And the underlying tax rate for the full year we still think is going to be in the range of 20% to 22%.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And then gain when it comes to the divestiture, you said, that still $0.20 and that's still to come and not in the guidance.\nNick Gangestad : It's still not in the guidance.\nSteve Tusa: Pre mature?\nNick Gangestad : Yes, that's still not in the guidance.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And then one last one, just on the second half are you planning for kind of there's a lot of things moving around, but are you planning, is this in your mind kind of normal seasonality for you guys for the second half of the year?\nNick Gangestad : Normal seasonality if I look at\u2026\nSteve Tusa: Normal.\nNick Gangestad : But the only thing that's abnormal is last year was a bit abnormal for us with some of our pull ahead sales into second quarter. So from a sequential basis we're not seeing this year progressing on an abnormal path. I think it'll be fairly normal.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And then just one last quick one, this $0.07 it's in the tax line, correct in the models that $0.07?\nNick Gangestad : That is correct, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nMike Roman: Hey Deane.\nNick Gangestad: Hey Deane.\nDeane Dray: Hey, the three problem areas that have been pressuring 3M for like more than past year auto electronics in China. So the China you called out has continued to be soft but notionally on a geographic basis is quarter it did not stand out as a particular negative. So can you comment on that and what kind of color you see across your businesses in China, in particular related to kind of the tariff and trade frictions?\nMike Roman: Yes, Dean, we do talk a lot about China auto electronics and kind of get them all together, but maybe just if you step back and look at China for 3M we continue to see strength in our healthcare business up high single digits. And so that was driving a strong growth for us. We also saw strength in our Medical Solutions business in particular. Transportation and Electronics was up low single digits in the quarter. We saw significant decline in Automotive OEM, but that was, countered offset by electronics up low single digits. We saw strong growth in our Transportation Safety business there and our Advanced Materials business. So there was some strength areas that helped trying to balance out. As I said earlier, sequentially we see Transportation and Electronics a little softer in the second half. And so we're taking a conservative view around build rates in electronics outlook as we built our view of the second half. And that's part of impacting China. But second quarter, some strengths and a good performance against a strong comp year-over-year.\nDeane Dray: That's helpful. And then on electronics, everyone wants to paint electronics all with the same brush, both product lines and geographies. But you made the comment earlier that display film was actually up and relatively strong and it was electronics material solutions that were softer. Maybe just share with us the nuances about why you would see those different dynamics within the supply chain. Maybe there's some semiconductor exposure there as well, but color would be helpful there.\nMike Roman: Yes I think that your last point is the place to start. Our electronic materials solutions business has a broader exposure in electronics, including semiconductor, fabrication, data centers, which continues to be a helpful market and growing. But it's got a little different exposure. Display materials, certainly has the consumer electronics piece. The biggest part of the revenue there is consumer electronics, but we're also moving into higher growth areas like automotive electrification and we continue to see growth there. We continue to see some good results. And I would say consumer electronics, we saw a little bit of an uptick in displayed demand in second quarter, little stronger than maybe we even expected as we started into the quarter. Some of that is you start to see a little bit of buying in anticipation of the second half season for consumer electronics. And so we saw a little bit of that starting in second quarter. And that that hits display materials more so in a much bigger impact than in electronic materials.\nDeane Dray: That's helpful. And just last one is more of a comment than a question is I really appreciate the comments about PFAS, and where that stands and the level of transparency that 3M is providing here. I'm just struck by how much misinformation is on the Internet regarding the chemical. Referenced it to being a forever chemical. And the reality is there are a number of very effective ways to remediate the chemical from water. They're all proven to be effective. The question of how much you want to spend, how big is the water body and your timeframe. So the remediation on this looks like it's doable and you all are taking an appreciated approach to this. So just wanted to have that.\nMike Roman: Yes thank you Deane. And we understand the concerns people have about their water. We take the issue seriously, but we're also seeing that we can make a difference in remediation and we'll continue to be transparent and update you as we go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Inch: Thanks everyone. Good morning.\nMike Roman: Good morning John.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning John.\nJohn Inch: Nick just to clarify. So the $0.20 when you say it's not in the guide, just to be clear, the $9.25, $9.75 would not include the $0.20 of pending gain from the sale of gas and flame. Is that correct?\nMike Roman : John that's correct. It does not include the pending gain from the sale of our gas detection business, nor does it include any impact that will come from Acelity when and if that in and when and if that closes which we expect will be later this year.\nJohn Inch: Right. And then Nick in the P&L the other expense income line of minus $256 million versus $51 million a year ago, I'm assuming Venezuela charge of $162 million is in that. And is the delta, the $36 million of nonop restructuring kind of getting you to $58 million? And does that number run through \u2013 doesn't look like it\u2019s running for the adjusted number, but maybe you can help me with just the bridge there.\nNick Gangestad: Yes, that other, that will include the Venezuela, will also include $36 million from the restructuring actions we took that were not part of operating expense, those were the two biggest things in there.\nJohn Inch: There's nothing else in there as consequences. And $36 million does run through, as a cost, runs through the adjusted number, is that correct?\nNick Gangestad: That is correct. That is correct.\nJohn Inch: Okay. Are there any, just while we're on gas and flame, are there any other businesses, I guess this was part of safety, right? Was there any other businesses Mike or Nick that you're looking at that may be potential candidates for divestiture?\nMike Roman : John, portfolio management is one of our top priorities and as you know it's been ongoing process for us. And we're actively managing this aspect of the portfolio and their fit with our value model. We've shown that when we don't have the right fit, we'll take action. But that's something ongoing process we'll keep you updated.\nJohn Inch: I guess my question is, would \u2013 did this just come about? Or were you've been working on it for a little while, or what was the genesis of it?\nMike Roman : This particular case, the gas detection business, when we made the acquisition of Scott Safety, this was part of our strategy at the time of acquisition. So this was we've talked about on portfolio how we think about complementing our organic priorities with acquisitions that leverage our fundamental strengths. Scott Safety was one of those, moves us into a high value space. And gas detection we identified that early that wasn't part of our strategy and now we're acting on it. \nJohn Inch: Got It. And then just a couple more cleanups. I think you said \u2013 maybe Nick can you just update us on your expectation for share repurchase in the second half? And then I think you raised the dividend by 6% in the first quarter. Maybe Mike, philosophically you've got a lot of \u2013 you got a few pressures on your cash call at the moment. Are you committed still to an annual dividend increase kind of looking out?\nNick Gangestad: Yes John, let me take that. First, as far as the dividend our position for many several years has been that we expected to grow, our dividend to grow in line with earnings over time. Now this particular year is with the 6% increase that's outstripping our earnings growth, but the concept of us continuing to increased earnings our dividends year-over-year, I'd say that's a philosophy and approach we continue to expect. But I would say as far as expecting a dividend increase that over time it will parallel fairly closely our earnings per share growth. And then John remind me of the first part of the question.\nJohn Inch: Sorry share repurchases.\nMike Roman: Share repurchase, yes.\nNick Gangestad: I've guided $1 billion to $1.5 billion for the full year. That would imply at most just a few hundred million in the second half of the year.\nJohn Inch: And, I'm sorry for this last point. Obviously the earnings are going down, is the philosophy you grow dividends with earnings, but if your earnings are going down, are you just going to hold the dividend, or and then wait for the catch up? Is that kind of the implication? I'm not actually trying to hold you to a number I'm just trying to understand the philosophy.\nNick Gangestad: No, the philosophy would be over time. I would think unlikely that we would decrease full flat or decrease a dividend even if there was one year of an earnings decline. If I go back to other times in our history where we've had an earnings decline, we still have some small increases in our dividend.\nJohn Inch: Got it. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning.\nMike Roman : Good morning John.\nNick Gangestad : Good morning John.\nJohn Walsh: So in the prepared remarks you kind of talked about higher pricing being able to offset inflation for the full year. Just want to pull apart that price piece and just we've seen a deceleration right for the full year on an absolute basis.\nNick Gangestad : Yes, I'll go even further John. So we've averaged about 70 basis points of price growth in the first half of the year. My best estimate for the full year is we'll be right in that range. So I wouldn't characterize it as a deceleration. I think about 70 basis points first half. I think something in the range of 70 basis points that can have is our best view on that now. And remain quite confident that it will more than outpace what we're seeing from a raw material and tariff inflation impact.\nJohn Walsh: Got you. And then just thinking about the third quarter organic growth the flat to up low single digits that still implies that the growth on growth would decelerate because you have an easier comp in Q3 of 2018, just maybe some color that you saw exiting the quarter, June, July, anything you can kind of talk to as the trajectory seeing currently.\nNick Gangestad : John's the biggest trajectory change that I'll say that that colors the flat to up low-single digits in the third quarter as far as versus a comp is my earlier statement that we expect Transportation and Electronics to be down low to mid-single digit. I think that will be the thing that colors why sequentially versus an easier comp it's not quite the same level of growth you would expect. When I look across the rest of our businesses your analysis you just went through, I think, is a pretty valid analysis.\nJohn Walsh: Great, appreciate it. Thank you.\nMike Roman: Yes thanks John.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed.\nLaurence Alexander: Good morning. I have two quick ones. Can you just give a little bit more detail on what trends you're seeing in aerospace, it seemed a bit weaker than what we've heard from other companies. And secondly, on PFAS or PFOS and PFOA, that litigation area, can you characterize whether the U.S. standards are tougher or easier than in Europe? And maybe just sort of help us get in front, get ahead of where the food contactor base is because I think that that's like another cloud of noise that shouldn't really be affecting you. But I think sort of people are, sort of focused on the European side there?\nMike Roman: Yes, Lawrence maybe starting with aerospace when we talked about the business we talked about Automotive and Aerospace together as one business and when you look at the divisions that we share and that we report the revenue from its together. Our aerospace business actually has shown some good growth as we come through the first half of the year. So it's smaller than our automotive business, but it's an important business for us in doing well. So I don't think we're saying anything different, in that respect.  What I would say about, thinking about Europe versus U.S. and PFAS or PFOA, PFOS regulations, the regulations are really evolving right now. I don't think it's clear to \u2013 I don't think I can clearly compare U.S. versus other international Europe regulations it\u2019s very evolving and we're working with regulators broadly both federal and local.\nLaurence Alexander: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning fellows.\nNick Gangestad: Hi, Jeff.\nMike Roman: Hi, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Hey obviously a lot of ground covered. I thought it might be interesting to just flip the script a little bit to things that look okay or a little bit better. So in particular your confidence level and consumer maybe being kind of middle of the guy, healthcare may be better. Just a couple finer points on what you see going on there what would drive that? Where are we at in kind of the drug delivery, comps, et cetera?\nMike Roman: Yes, so I would say if you look at healthcare, we talked about at a good quarter. And behind that is a strong market growth. So this was a \u2013 we\u2019re not a place where we got good market dynamics and our businesses are performing well. We had our biggest business, our Medical Solutions business, up mid single digits, we saw strength in the U.S. we saw strength in China as I talk about it. Our food safety business was up mid-single digits, our Health Information Systems business was up high single digits. So it's pretty broad-based performance as we went through the quarter. We did see a decline in drug delivery as we expected in mid-sing digits in Q2. We\u2019re talking about how we see that stabilizing as we go through 2019 and we do see some improvements sequentially as we go into the second half in that business. So that will actually help the overall performance of the Health Care business. So second half we also have the same comparables year-over-year dynamic. We have a little easier comparable in the second half. So strong market dynamics, a portfolio performing well, broadly and I think, a strong of performance against comps in the second half. You look at Consumer we're at 1% and as Nick's comments said, kind of the middle of the range as we look for the total year. If we look, we got good balance between our sell in and sell out. And all of our businesses in the second quarter were growing with exception of our home care business. And we see that sell out dynamic setting up a good middle of the range kind of performance in the second half against some growth in retail spending in the macro.\nJeff Sprague: Is there anything that conclude or any comp issue as it relates to that home care business? What was actually going on there?\nMike Roman: I think we saw maybe a little bit of a comp year-over-year we had some of the same go-live of the U.S. ERP deployment impacting that business. And I would say consumer is larger in the U.S. than some of our other businesses. About half of our global revenue is in the U.S. So it's a bigger footprint. So it has a slightly higher impact when you have that pull ahead, and it did impact all of those businesses in 2018.\nJeff Sprague: Alright, thank you guys.\nNick Gangestad: Yes thanks Jeff.\nMike Roman: Thanks Jeff.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments\nMike Roman: To wrap up, I am encouraged by our Company's progress in the second quarter. Our execution was strong in the face of continued slow growth conditions and key end markets. As we effectively managed costs and improved our cash flow. Moving ahead and we remain focused on continuing to drive operational improvements, investing for the future and delivering for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the 3M First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, April 25, 2019. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. \nBruce Jermeland: Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2019 business review. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Nick will make some formal comments and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Please note that today\u2019s earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading, Quarterly Earnings. Please turn to Slide 2. Before we begin, let me remind you to mark your calendars for upcoming earnings calls on July 25, and October 24.  Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1a of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Finally, please note that throughout today\u2019s presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular measures which exclude the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and significant litigation-related charges. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation and press release. Please turn to Slide 4, and I\u2019ll hand it off to Mike. Mike?\nMichael Roman: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. The first quarter was a disappointing start to the year for 3M. We continued to face slowing in several key end markets, which impacted both growth and margins, and our operational execution fell short of the expectations we have for ourselves. Today I will lay out a number of aggressive actions we are taking to drive productivity, reduce costs and improve cash flow, as we manage through challenges in some of our end markets. In addition, I will provide an update on two litigation issues that affect affected our results. And provide updated guidance for the full year. I will also discuss the realignment of our business groups that we announced last month which will enable even greater growth and operational efficiency. Please turn to slide 5 for a summary of our first quarter numbers. Organic growth company-wide was minus 1%, lower than we anticipated. We saw end market softness in China, Automotive and Electronics, which we have discussed throughout the quarter. We also faced channel inventory adjustments, which negatively impacted several of our businesses. With respect to EPS, we posted adjusted earnings of $2.23 per share down 11% year-over-year. This excludes significant litigation charges related to the PFAS and respirators, which I will discuss later in my remarks. Underlying margins were 21% in the quarter, down 160 basis points with adjusted income of $1.7 billion. Our earnings and margin shortfall was due to a combination of two things. First negative organic growth in the quarter and the second weak productivity, especially in our Industrial related businesses within Asia Pacific and the United States. As the actions we took were not sufficient to offset the broad-based softening we faced in those markets as the quarter progressed. Please turn to slide 6. We are moving quickly to strengthen our performance and address the challenges we face and the actions on this slide are underway. First, we are reducing approximately 2,000 positions, through both voluntary and involuntary actions. Reductions will span all business groups, functions and geographies with emphasis on corporate structure and underperforming areas of the portfolio. On a pre-tax basis we will take a charge of approximately $150 million in 2019, and we expect annual savings of approximately $225 million to $250 million, with $100 million this year. Job reductions are never easy, but they are necessary to make us stronger and a more competitive enterprise as we move forward. Beyond restructuring, we are also driving cash flow by reducing inventory levels and accelerating actions on indirect costs. Importantly, while we take these actions we remain focused on our customers and balancing short term pressures with the long-term success of 3M. That is why we will continue our investments in growth, which includes research and development and our priority growth programs. This is a playbook we know how to execute and we are confident it will enable us to maximize value for shareholders as we work through the market slowdowns and our related actions, positioning us for strong growth as our markets recover. Please turn to slide 7. As I mentioned earlier, two significant litigation matters related to PFAS and respirators impacted our quarter and resulted in a total charge of $548 million or $0.72 per share. We increased our respiratory reserve by $313 million to address the costs of resolving all current and expected: coal mine dust lawsuits in Kentucky and West Virginia. We also established a PFAS reserve of $235 million to cover certain environmental matters and litigation related to the manufacture and disposal of PFAS at five 3M facilities, including three in the United States and two in Europe. This reserve does not include any product claims related to PFAS. We continue to work closely with the EPA and other regulatory bodies to support science-based regulations of these chemistries. We also continue to work with the communities we serve to ensure they can have confidence in the quality of their drinking water, additional details will be available in our upcoming 10-Q filing. Please turn to slide 8 for an update on our 2019 guidance. While we remain positive on the global macroeconomic environment, growth conditions in certain markets have been slower than anticipated going into the year. As a result, today we are updating our range for organic growth to minus one to the top plus 2%, against the prior range of one 1% to 4%. In addition, we anticipate adjusted earnings of $9.25 to $9.75 per share which includes the restructuring impact versus the previous range of $10.45 to $10.90. We now expect a return on invested capital of 20% to 22% against the prior range of 22$ to 25%. We continue to anticipate a free cash flow conversion rate of 95% to 105%. I'll come back to make some comments on our new business group alignment after Nick takes you through the details of the quarter. Nick\nNicholas Gangestad: Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide 9. Organic sales declined 1.1% in the first quarter, with volumes down 200 basis points and selling prices up 90 basis points. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures reduced sales by 50 basis points. While foreign currency translation was an additional 3.4 percentage point headwind to sales. All-in, first quarter sales in U.S. dollars decreased 5% versus last year. Geographically the U.S. declined 40 basis points organically, Consumer and Electronics and Energy grew low-single digits, while Industrial, Safety and Graphics and Health Care declined. Asia Pacific was down 3.6% organically in Q1, impacted by the slowdown in China, Automotive and Electronics markets. Health Care delivered positive high single-digit organic growth in the quarter, while Industrial, Consumer and Electronics and Energy declined. Organic growth was down 4% in China/Hong Kong against an 11% comparison a year ago. Japan organic growth declined 7%, or excluding Electronics increased 2%. Latin America/Canada and EMEA each grew 1% organically in the quarter. Please turn to slide 10 for the first quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide first quarter sales were $7.9 billion, with adjusted operating income of $1.7 billion and adjusted operating margins of 21.4%. On the right-hand side of this slide, you can see the components of our margin performance in the first quarter. Declines in organic volume and weak productivity reduced margins 180 basis points year-on-year. Productivity challenges were most pronounced in our Industrial related businesses within Asia Pacific and the United States. Acquisitions and divestitures combined brought down margins by 40 basis points, primarily driven by our acquisition of M*Modal which closed in February. Higher selling prices continued to more than offset raw material inflation contributing 30 basis points to first quarter margins. And finally, foreign currency net of hedging impacts increased margins by an additional 30 basis points. Let's now turn to slide 11 for a closer look at earnings per share. First quarter adjusted earnings were $2.23 per share, down 11% year-over-year. As you see, a number of factors impacted first quarter earnings. Most significantly, negative organic growth and weak productivity reduced per share earnings by $0.19 in the quarter. This was notably different from our outlook in January. The rest of our EPS factors are in line with our original expectations. Acquisitions and divestitures combined reduced first quarter earnings by $0.07 per share versus last year. Foreign currency net of hedging was an additional $0.05 per share headwind in the quarter. As expected, our underlying tax rate increased year-on-year, which reduced Q1 earnings $by $0.05. And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding 4% versus Q1 last year, adding $0.09 to per share earnings. Please turn to slide 12 for a look at our cash flow performance. First quarter free cash flow was $657 million, with a free cash flow conversion rate of 74%, which includes a 24 percentage point benefit from the litigation-related charges. First quarter capital expenditures were $391 million, up $87 million year-on-year. For the full year, we now anticipate CapEx investments in the range of 1.6 billion to $1.7 billion versus a prior range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. We increased our first quarter per share dividend by 6%, resulting in $830 million in cash dividends paid to shareholders during the quarter. Gross share repurchases were $701 million in the quarter, and we continue to expect full year repurchases in the range of $2 billion to $4 billion. Please turn to slide 13, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q1. Please note additional business group performance details can be found in the appendix of this presentation. As mentioned earlier, throughout the quarter we continued to see soft end market trends in China, Automotive and Electronics, along with channel inventory adjustments. These trends primarily impacted our Industrial, Safety and Graphics, and Electronics and Energy businesses. Our Industrial business saw a broad-based slowdown across most of its portfolio, posting an organic sales decline of 2.8% to start the year. This slow organic growth within Industrial was most pronounced in our automotive business. Our automotive OEM business was down 9% year-on-year, impacted by a 6% decline in first quarter global car and light truck builds, along with channel inventory reductions, particularly in China. A positive note, advanced materials continued to deliver strong organic growth in the quarter, up high single digits.  On a geographic basis Industrial's organic growth was led by 1% increases in both Latin America/Canada and EMEA, while the U.S. declined 2% and Asia Pacific declined 8%. Industrial's first quarter operating margins were 20%, down 280 basis points, impacted by sales declines and weak productivity. Moving to Safety and Graphics, first quarter sales were flat organically against last year's 7% comparison. Personal Safety continued to deliver solid results in Q1, up 3% organically, while each of the other three businesses declined. Geographically, organic growth was led by Latin America/Canada and EMEA, each up 2%. Asia Pacific was flat, while the U.S. was down 3%. Safety and Graphics first quarter operating margins were 23.2%, down 380 basis points. The year-on-year operating margin decline included a negative 110 basis point impact from a gain on a divestiture last year, along with slow growth and weak productivity. Next our Health Care business was up 1% organically in the first quarter. Holding back growth in Health Care was the continued softness in our drug delivery business, down nearly 20% organically in the first quarter, which negatively impacted overall Health Care organic growth by nearly 2 percentage points. Organic growth was led by food safety, up high single digits followed by health information systems up mid-single digits, while medical solutions and oral care were each up low-single digits organically. On a geographic basis, Asia Pacific led the way up 7%, with EMEA up 3%. The U.S. declined 3% impacted by drug delivery. Health Care's first quarter operating margins were 28.1% which included a negative 230 basis point impact from the Q1 acquisition of M*Modal. Shifting to the Electronics and Energy business, organic sales declined 3% in the first quarter. The Energy side of the business grew 5%, while the Electronics related businesses were down 6%, with declines in both display material systems and Electronics material solutions. Electronics related growth was impacted by soft end market demand in Consumer Electronics and factory automation, along with channel inventory adjustments. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by a 2% increase in the U.S., while Asia Pacific declined 5%. First quarter operating margins were 23.8%, down 110 basis points year-over-year. Lastly, first quarter organic growth for the Consumer business was 1%. Sales grew in our home improvement business, up 3% organically, while home care and consumer health care declined. Looking at Consumer geographically, organic growth was led by a 3% increase in the U.S., with particular strength in our Filtrete and command brands. EMEA declined 1% as we continued to adjust our portfolio in this region and Asia Pacific declined 3% impacted by lower Consumer demand for respiratory solutions. Consumer's operating margins were 19.5% in the first quarter. That wraps up our review of first quarter results. Please turn to slide 14, and I'll hand it back over to Mike to discuss the business group realignment. Mike?\nMichael Roman: Thank you, Nick. Earlier I laid out actions we are taking to address our near-term challenges. At the same time we are continuing to build 3M for the long run. Effective April 1, we moved from five to four business groups in order to better serve our customers and better align our businesses to their markets. The new business groups are organized around customers and go-to-market models and include Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, Health Care, and Consumer. This realignment will enable us to accelerate growth, maximize value across the portfolio, and take greater advantage of our transformation progress. It will also further streamline the organization and help us achieve the 200 to 300 basis points of margin expansion that we laid out last November as part of our five-year plan. We will start reporting results under this structure in the second quarter. Please turn to slide 15, and I will take you through our 2019 guidance for the new business groups. We expect organic growth to be led by Health Care with a range of 2% to 4%, followed by Consumer at 1% to 3%. Organic growth in Safety & Industrial is expected in the range of minus 1% to plus 2%, with Transportation & Electronics at minus 3% to flat. That wraps up our prepared remarks. In summary, while our recent performance is disappointing, our business model remains strong and we are making the necessary changes to accelerate 3M into a stronger future. Thank you. And we will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin: Good morning, guys.\nMichael Roman: Morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Just a question on margins. I think the last time you had this kind of revenue decline, as I look at my model was sort of 4Q \u201815 and 1Q \u201816 and sort of the operating leverage impact was a lot less I think in 1Q \u201816 margins actually went up. So I'm just trying to understand what happened with the margin decline in the quarter and specifically also, as I look at the gross margin, what surprised me once again looking at my model, the last time you had gross margins that low I think was 4Q \u201908 or 1Q \u201809, so that\u2019s very odd? Thank you.\nMichael Roman: Thank you, Andrew. Maybe I\u2019ll l start and I'll ask Nick to give some more detailed comments. The two drivers of that, one is the organic growth and the organic growth as we talked about was led by China, Automotive and Electronics, which are strong gross margin businesses for us globally. So that was one of the contributing factors. And then the adjustments that came in the channel, along with that slowing growth in those markets, that drove challenges for us in productivity in the plants. And we took actions to adjust our production levels and our costs there, but we didn't get ahead of it. So those were a couple of the big contributor really driven off of that slowing the majority of that slowing from those end markets\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes. Andrew, a couple things to add in there. As we were going through the quarter and seeing lower volumes and we of course adjusted the output coming out of our factories. So for the first quarter, compared to the first quarter last year, we were seeing the output in our factories down between 4% and 5%. Unfortunately we did not pull spending down proportionately. Our spending was down about 1% in our factories during that time. And that had a negative impact on our margin. Also on the - in there was the impact of a bit of a geographic mix, if you look at where we make higher margins and lower margins, the declines that we saw in Asia Pacific had an outsized impact on our margin this quarter.\nMichael Roman: Andrew, I would also add, we - as I said in my speech, we didn't respond aggressively enough to what we were seeing. And so we\u2019re behind the curve as we came through the quarter. That's why we're stepping in aggressively with the actions that we are\u2026\nAndrew Obin: Let me ask the question maybe another way. We were surprised I think the Asia top line growth was fairly well telegraphed, maybe Japan surprised a little bit, but it's North American decline that also surprised me. And you continued sort of - you did note weak productivity in North America multiple times. And I was just wondering, how much - and I know we sort of finished the customer-facing ERP rollout. Can you just give us an update? Are you rolling out on the factories your key factories in North America, are you rolling ERP on the manufacturing floor, and is that disruptive? Thank you.\nMichael Roman: Andrew, just to update on the ERP, we've actually been very pleased with the success that we've had in the deployment in the U.S., and it has been around the businesses and not deployed to the factory level at this point. It's improving every month in our performance and what we can deliver to our customers. So that's been something that's been going well for us. When you look at the U.S., the growth, - organic growth in the U.S. was led by Industrial business, and really the automotive OEM and aftermarket businesses. There are some pockets in Safety & Graphics. And so the same kind of comments I had is as we saw slowing growth and some of the channel reactions, our production levels and our productivity didn't get ahead of it, and that was an important part of what we saw in the U.S. There are some other pockets. There are some pockets in Health Care with drug delivery in the U.S. that also contributed to that. But that gives you the background in the U.S.\nAndrew Obin: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nMichael Roman: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: So I'm just thinking about the organic growth guide for the year of minus one to plus two, obviously slower start towards the low end to start the year. I guess, I'm just \u2013 as I'm thinking about, how you guys actually get towards that higher end of the range as we progress through the year. I'm just curious like did trends get any better as we exited the quarter? I know comps get tougher as we progress through the year. I'm just trying to like put some context around that guidance for the year?\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes. So Joe maybe I'll start. The \u2013 it was led by the markets that we called out and the channel reaction to some of that. That doesn't end up being an all year action. That is something that happens pretty quickly. So we don't see that necessarily be a contributor as we go through the year. And some \u2013 we do see some outlook for improvements in those markets. Health Care we have talked about challenge, we see with drug delivery being a headwind for us in the first half of the year and that gets better as we go through the year. Consumers basically at the bottom end of their range and the sellout remain strong. And in Safety and Graphics, we have a couple of pockets there. Our personnel safety business is off to a strong start to the year. And so up mid-single digits or low- to mid-single digits and we expect that to continue. The other pockets are more project delays in particular businesses and we expect those to improve as we go through the year. So it's really taking a look at each of those businesses and the guidance that we gave to those fits with Q1 and then where we see the rest of the year.\nMichael Roman: And Joe on the comp issue consistent with what we've been saying we see second quarter as our toughest comp and third quarter as our easiest comp and that's primarily driven by the what we had talked about a year ago as far as the timing of revenue related to our U.S. ERP go live. So we saw almost 6% organic growth in second quarter last year followed by 1.3% in the third quarter. So those are the two where we see the comps differentiating. All-in we saw the \u2013 we saw and we continue to see the first half as a slightly tougher comp for us than in the second half of the year.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And if I could just follow up just on the margins for a second. So taking a look at your gross margins for the quarter. It's hard for me to go back into history and see a time where gross margins were down as much year-over-year. And Nick you referred to it a little bit when you responded to the lower growth environment in your response from a cost-out perspective at the factory level. I just want to understand that a little bit better because it's just historically this hasn't part of the hallmark of how you guys have executed.\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes Joe. Just one thing I think I need to make sure is clear with you and with everyone. In the gross margin on a GAAP basis is $235 million charge related to PFAS. So in the numbers that you're seeing there on our GAAP results, not all of that hit SG& A other 235 of that is recorded in gross margin. And Andrew that may go back to your earlier question too. So that's maybe when you're looking at our GAAP results the one thing you're seeing. That said, we still saw declines in our gross margin percentage, primarily driven by what I just talked about at the lower volumes not offset with commensurate declines in spending. Pulling out the PFAS charge we saw are underlying gross margin decline about 100 basis points.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. Thanks for that clarification. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, guys.\nMichael Roman: Good morning, Andy.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Nick, you mentioned productivity is the issue, a big issue in Industrial in North America and Asia Pacific. If we go back over time industrial has been a segment where 3M has consistently struggled to grow margin and obviously productivity we talked about was worse in Q1. So could you talk about the transformation helping North America? I know you mentioned it's helping, but it's hard to see. I mean can you talk about your confidence that you can improve productivity in the quarters, especially in North America and Europe where you've talked about an expectation of big margin improvement going forward.\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes. So Andy, when you look at Industrial there's a couple of things around productivity that we're focused on. And the first one is it is getting in line with the growth that we see in the business. And automotive OEM, automotive aftermarket those are challenged end markets that we're especially aggressive getting on top of and in terms of our productivity. But it's more broad than that because -- especially in the U.S. we are a net exporter out of the U.S. and we do support business around the world and in particular in Asia. And so we're impacted by a broader softness in those markets as well. So it's a bigger productivity challenge in particular in the U.S. but in Industrial more broadly. And so the actions that we're focused on they're targeting that, getting ahead of the curve so to speak. And then it's taking advantage of all the other things that we've talked about the levers for creating greater value. And Business Transformation is a big one of those. Now we haven't deployed that in the U.S. into the plants. But we've made good progress with the go live, since the go live of last year and we continue to see good benefits and value coming out of the ERP deployment in Canada and EMEA. And our margins more broadly including industrial has been improving there and in part because of what we're doing in Business Transformation. So that's going to be an important lever as we move ahead. But the near term is getting ahead of the impact of the slowing end markets and the channel and getting our productivity in line.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Okay Mike. And maybe shifting gears. Can you talk about the cadence of your business performance through the quarter and what you've seen to the extent that you can talked about in April. Theoretically, there's been more enthusiasm in places like China given an increase in our tax cuts that could help markets like China auto or electronics. So have you seen any improvements in any of your short cycle businesses over the last few weeks or a month or two?\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes, Andy, certainly as we went through first quarter we talked a bit about the slowing that we saw as it went through the quarter and that continued right through the end of the quarter. And really, led by those markets, China automotive, electronics. So those are all the ones we've been talking about. There is \u2013 I think the outlook is, that gets better. When you listen to the projections and the economic projections in those areas, we haven't seen that. Our April is basically on track with what we're laying out for our total year guidance. But seeing a market improvement in those markets, I think, we'll see \u2013 we'll get an answer as we move further into the quarter, into the second quarter.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Thanks, guys.\nNicholas Gangestad: Thanks, Andy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Inch: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.\nMichael Roman: Good morning, John.\nJohn Inch: Good morning, guys. Mike, you opened the call talking about you, sort of, were positive \u2013 remain positive on a global macro. But I'm trying to understand, maybe, back to Andy's question, there are a degree of evidence, right, that electronics markets in Asia, maybe even China and China auto and so forth, are bottoming. Why you would you take the 2,000 hedge action now? I mean, are you implicitly signaling that you actually don't think that there is going to be much of an improvement in the foreseeable future? Or is this kind of a catch-up from something you should have been doing before and you were just hopeful things were not going to kind of fall apart to the degree they have?\nMichael Roman: Yes. John, so your point about the global macro is right. There is an expectation that there will be a broader growth in the global macro and maybe a bit slower as we come through the year in terms of global industrial production in particular. In the markets that we're talking about, they certainly have been slowed. But people have a view that it gets better as we get into the second half. I think, to a degree it's realigning ourselves. The actions we're taking is realigning ourselves with what we see in the market and what we've been working through as we come through for sure, kind of, the end of Q4 or end of Q1. If the markets recover, we \u2013 this is our playbook. When we see a slowdown, we realign our costs, we realign our operations, we take some targeted restructuring action and then we're in a good position to lead out. So I think this aligns us with what we today, really what we need to do in order to deliver on our commitments and then positions us to lead out of it. And so, if we do see that improvement in the second half, we'll be well positioned to lead out, even with these actions that we're taking.\nJohn Inch: In other words, you don't have to hire people back if things turn? Is that what you...\nMichael Roman: No, I think, we're aligning ourselves as we go forward, taking advantage of some of the things that we're doing to \u2013 with business transformation to leverage that. So this is \u2013 it's never easy to do this. And it is \u2013 you're asking question around something that we think very hard about. And I really am taking on very personally, we've got to think about what do we need to do near term and position ourselves for the long term. And we're going to continue to invest in growth into R&D and R&D growth programs and priority growth opportunities more broadly. So we're making sure to make this restructuring and realignment targeted to what we what we have to manage through. And so, will we need to hire people in the future? Yes, of course. As we go forward we will, where we see the opportunities and we'll invest. But in the near term, we've got to realign ourselves to be ready to deliver on those statements.\nJohn Inch: Got it. I want to shift gears to PFAS. If you go by the K, the litigation over the past couple of years definitely seems to be rising. There's a lot of reasons that people have potentially thrown out. First, I want to confirm that you do not have insurance in any context to pay for any of these litigation costs. I think the 850 to Minnesota was paid out of cash, right? And then the second thing is could you guys just give us a sense of what exactly is your playbook for dealing with this? Are you just going to litigate concurrently? Or are you going to try and bundle this and deal with it? I just -- it's hard to know from where we stand right why this isn't potentially an asbestos round two that unfortunately ended up bankrupting dozens of U.S. companies. And I don't think you're in that situation but anything you could say to that will be helpful.\nNicholas Gangestad: Hey, John I'll just start talking about insurance and then I'll pass it over to Mike for your broader question. In regards to insurance and coverage for that for environmental claim such as PFAS, we do have places where we think we have insurance coverage and we are in discussions with insurance carriers regarding those matters. But that's going to take time for that to play out, John. That's -- don't look for that in the short-term for something to happen on that front.\nMichael Roman: Yes. And John just regarding the litigation activity. I mean, we are actively depending ourselves in all of this litigation. And it's difficult to know the timing and outcome of any particular litigation. And what we were able to do with the reserve this quarter is to really establish reserves that help us resolve the litigation that is related to environmental matters. And I would say litigation were a direct defendant around our manufacturing disposal. As I said in my comments, it is not covering any other product related PFAS litigation. And when you have the manufacturing in view where it's probable and estimable, the product litigation at this point that were defending ourselves against is not probable an estimable. And so we will update as appropriate and as we get some clarity on that. So it's really -- there are two different aspects of it there that we're managing.\nJohn Inch: Would it be fair to say this is going on for years. I don't see any a milestone event that potentially stops there. Is that a fair thing? It looks like the EPA is going to potentially come out with even more articulate regulations or guidelines or something like that.\nMichael Roman: Yes, and we continue to work with the EPA and other regulatory bodies on the foundation for the regulations that are being talked about and what will come. EPA, of course, announced a management plan for this and we're working with them to support where we go forward there. We actually are supportive of a federal approach here so we don't end up with a state-by-state approach that's different or patch work kind of approach. But it is something that is evolving and we'll continue to help be part of that with the EPA. And like I said, we'll update you on our litigation matters as appropriate.\nJohn Inch: Got it. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning.\nMichael Roman: Good morning, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: Morning. Maybe a first question for Mike. So just trying to think about the last few months at 3M. You had the outlook meeting in November with some medium-term goals. Then you had a sort of re-segmentation more recently, and then today restructuring alongside another guidance reduction. So I understand that the restructuring and the guidance reduction, obviously, very closely linked. But I'm trying to understand what else has changed since that November meeting where it sounded like a case of steady-state high CapEx, high R&D the same segments. Then we heard the segments being changed. Now, the CapEx commitment seems to be wavering per the CapEx cut this morning. So, maybe just talk us through more broadly how your own thoughts about running and organizing and managing 3M have changed in the past few months.\nMichael Roman: Sure. And I'll go back to that in November Investor Day. I would say first of all, the realignment of the business group us was part of our thinking at that point. We weren't ready to announce it and implement it. There were things that we have to do to get ready for that. But it was part of -- even as I talked about, it's part of our expectations that will drive improvements of 200 to 300 basis points in our margin. And it really is set up to help us leverage best our business transformation and end-to-end streamline our connection to customers. So, it's part of the longer term strategy. As we came into the year, as we walk through the quarter -- even as we came in, we certainly acknowledge that we're seeing slowing in some of those key end markets. It got more severe as we go to our earnings call -- in the Q4 earnings call in January. As we went through February, we saw additional slowing and we're talking about it. And we were taking actions all along the way. We were doing things. We've been doing things along the way to adjust and address that slowing we are seeing, but we didn't get ahead of the curve. And so the restructuring and the other actions we're taking is to really do that now. So, it is -- I would say it's still rooted in that five-year plan and our commitment to investments and growth in R&D and the strategies that we talked about there is still very much part of it. The 3M model is strong. We've got to near-term execute and get in line with what we're seeing in these end markets. And that became kind of the new, I would say, set of actions that we had to step into and we're doing that. But again we know how to execute this playbook. We'll be rallying the team around us as we go through the next couple of days and I'm confident that we will step into it as we go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. And then my second question maybe around any updated thoughts on the portfolio. Should we view the re-segmentation as opening the door to any divestments? Does the guidance reduction make you think that maybe more portfolio pruning is needed? And on the other side of the ledger, should we expect more acquisitions now that M*Modal has closed? Or is it more of a case of there are some internal things to fix, let's fix those first and think about M&A maybe next year?\nMichael Roman: Julian I'll start here as I always do. Organic growth is our first priority. So, we're going to continue to focus investments there as I said even as we go through this restructuring. But we still maintain flexibility to invest in the long-term value of the enterprise. And so acquisitions we have built strong capabilities to make acquisitions that fit with our fundamental strengths that fit in our most attractive markets. And we've been executing that. We still see that as a value driver for us in the future. And so we continue to stay active looking at acquisitions. We're going to continue to step into compelling acquisitions that leverage that strategy and capabilities that we have to create value. On the divestiture side, we've been actively managing a portfolio since 2012. And over the last three years, we've strengthened parts of our portfolio. It was a case we're always looking at how do we maximize the portfolio. And we're looking at businesses regardless of size on how we do we do that and how do we maximize value for the company and it's really around the fit with our fundamental strengths and we'll continue to actively manage it as we go forward. It's an ongoing process and we'll be focused on creating value with that as well.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nMichael Roman: Good morning, Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Just on the comment on inventory destocking, Mike and Nick, do you have a sense for what that might have cost you in the quarter?\nNicholas Gangestad: Josh, so for the quarter we still built inventory.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: I mean, your customer's destocking. I'm sorry. \nNicholas Gangestad: I'm sorry. I think it very easily could have impacted our total revenue by 100 basis points.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful.\nMichael Roman: Josh just to give you a little color too. The automotive slowdown in China was one particular case where we saw significant impact in our growth from channel. And so where you see a slowdown in a particular market, like electronics or automotive it's accompanied with a change in inventory, everything from finished goods back through the value chain. And so that is a \u2013 that's clearly visible in those cases.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. And then just pivoting back to an earlier question on some of the PFAS litigation, as a non-attorney this is maybe more obvious to other folks than myself. But given that you already have kind of one fight example in Minnesota with an 850 settlement. Is there a reason why adding the other four in there might not just be 850 times four. Is it kind of a easily digestible answer? Or is it a lot of hey it depends and there's a lot of differences?\nMichael Roman: Well, our manufacture footprint is different in every one of those sites and so that's part of it. But it really \u2013 I guess, if you can take from this is, it's not simply that \u2013 not simple math of multiplying times five. We've \u2013 we now define probable and estimable for the litigation that we face in those five sites as \u2013 with this reserve. So that is our \u2013 the way we have had determine what is estimable across that.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. Thanks for that. And then just one last one on some of the re-segmentation. I understand this is not the quite the same thing as ERP was last year. But could we expect some sort of disruption to the customer side with some of the restructuring and re-segmentation being implemented? Thanks.\nMichael Roman: The realignment of the businesses is really \u2013 really the key focus for us was the customer and really aligning to them aligning to the customer segments and the type of customer and the go-to-market model. So we are actually \u2013 we've been moving towards this with some of the go-to-market model, capabilities that we've been putting in place and the way we leverage Business Transformation. This actually steps it forward even more. So I think this is not only focused on the customer I think the customers will see this as a positive step forward. And we'll see it as better aligned to them as we globally as we move ahead.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Okay. Thanks Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nMichael Roman: Hey, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Hey, I missed the very beginning intro comments. And we've touched on this channel inventory adjustment topic a couple of different times, with Josh's question just then. But can you just clarify how much was any kind of 4Q pull-in getting ahead of tariffs, getting ahead of price increases? And maybe you also had some of this ERP pull-in as well. How much of a factor is that in terms of this inventory adjustment?\nMichael Roman: Yes Deane we talked about a bit on our Q4 call. We saw the channel as well as balanced as we came into the year. We didn't see a pull-ahead in Q1 into Q4. The ERP impacts were largely Q2/Q3; we saw some tail of that into Q4. And it's hard to tell there may be a small tail as we come into this year as well which would be more playing out of some inventory. But that's a U.S. kind of view. The -- when I look at it, even as we went through the quarter, I would say Health Care channels are well balanced. We certainly saw our balance between sell-in, sell-out, and consumer. It was the Electronics and Automotive driven changes that really led to the channel impact. And maybe a few pockets in Safety and Graphics in areas like transportation where we had some project delays. But the bigger was in the Industrial and Electronics areas. So, that developed as the quarter went along and the response was very, very direct and we saw that in Q1.\nDeane Dray: Got it. And then on -- to go back to your comments about the lag in realigning your cost with the lower demand through the quarter. It would be interesting hearing from you about what was different about your response time. Is this -- just -- is this inherent to the 3M short cycle business? You just don't have that visibility; so therefore, you can't ramp down the cost structure that quickly. Does that put you at a disadvantage here in terms of the responsiveness? When you I look at decrimentals, companies that can ramp down costs quickly, typically will see a 25% decremental and you're well lower than that. So, it look like it did get away from you, but some color there will be helpful.\nMichael Roman: Yes. Deane we did take actions as we saw slowing growth. We're reducing production plants, we're adjusting demand plan. And we're trying to look ahead as much as we can into our customers get a clear view. And I would say in the direct businesses, we got a pretty clear view. It was a matter of how fast can we react. And we took actions in the end our volume that we produced went down in line obviously with our organic growth, but our costs didn't. And that was one of the challenges. And some of that is fixed cost some of that is variable costs and we need to do something on both of those. And so that's where the restructuring is targeting that. And that's not unusual in these situations in the industrial slowdown in 2015-2016; I face the same thing in leading that business and even in 2009. We have to take restructuring actions to really step into a bigger slowdown and in most particular markets that's what is taking here. And so the steps we took now we'll get ahead of the curve.\nDeane Dray: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please proceed.\nScott Davis: Hi, good morning guys.\nMichael Roman: Hey Scott.\nScott Davis: Hi. I want to change gears a little bit because I think the -- I think most people at this point kind of get the issues. But I want to talk a little bit about R&D productivity and payback because just back the envelope, I don't think 3M historically has outgrown the Industrial group, in fact, it seemed to have undergrown some of the higher end peers out there and certainly spent a lot of money on R&D. Obviously there's a higher margin structure that is supported by that. But how do you fix that? How do you get the growth rate to really accelerate from these levels, which are really, basically just GDP type levels over time over really almost any time period you look at?\nMichael Roman: Yes, Scott, so you're right. Our investment in R&D and I would say innovation more broadly is fundamental to what we promised our investors and that is strong growth. Growth that outgrows the macro over our business cycles and deliver premium margins, deliver premium ROIC. And innovation is fundamental to that. In fact, it's the differentiator in our ability to do that. And I think in a quarter like this and even the cycle that we've been going through it's right to challenge our growth aspect of that. And what we are doing is really focused on that as well. And I would say this our capacity and our demonstrateability outgrow the macro over time has come from two important factors. One is our investment in innovation. Our ability to deliver new penetration opportunities with our innovation, new priority growth platforms as we talk about. And so those are very much a focus for us. It's also important that we do that in markets that are accretive to the macro that we're choosing. And that's our portfolio management. Make sure we're prioritizing in the most attractive market spaces. And so that is -- we often talked about the priorities organic growth in our capital allocation approximately 6% to sales and R&D and 4%, 5% to 5.5% in CapEx. But we prioritize that. It is really important that we prioritizing that and that's what we do to get that growth where we needed to be. And we did it in markets in that are most attractive. That's the focus. That\u2019s when I talk about continuing to invest in growth that's what I'm talking about.\nScott Davis: Fair enough Mike. And when every add, I mean, you've been on board now you're not brand-new, but you're relatively new I think in comparison to many CEOs. And do you think you need to change the compensation scheme at all? Or is there something that as far as getting incentives more aligned with faster execution, because and I don't mean this to be mean. But if you go back really think about the 20 years or so I've covered your stock. 3M always seems to be a little bit behind on the restructuring curve almost never ahead. And even if you get this one right you're still behind. So do you need to change anything around the incentives or compensation scheme to get some of your leaders to move a little faster?\nMichael Roman: I think compensation is an important part of this. And we've updated and modified our compensation over time to do just what you're talking about to really align our leaders with what we need to deliver. And in particular, our promise to our investors, our organic growth, our EPS growth, our ROIC, our free cash flow. That is how they're aligned. They are aligned to the four promises. And were we -- should we take another look at that? I would say that's our normal course for us. We're going to take stock of what we're doing, how we're doing it and compensation is an important piece and we look at that as well.\nScott Davis: Okay. Good luck guys. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLaurence Alexander: Good morning. So, just wanted to touch on two things. First, is there -- as you think about the -- when I think about the call -- you talked about the -- this kind of sequencing, it's usually a multi quarter episode, I mean I'm thinking about like the way you slice it down [indiscernible] a few years ago. Can you just be clear, have you seen any actual churn in your order patents? Or is it just affects of sequential stabilization?\nMichael Roman: Lawrence, I mean you broke up a bit, so I'm not sure I got a question. But I think you're asking about the softening and the slowdowns that we're seeing. They can sometimes last longer. Do we see any indication that those are turning or not expected last long, is that the kind of\u2026\nLaurence Alexander: Right. Did you see \u2013 have you seen any actual turns in order patterns? Or is it really just more -- everybody's forecasting the back half therefore?\nMichael Roman: Well, I would say we haven't seen a sharp turn in softening markets. We're in line as we go into April with our expectations. I would say maybe we see that the inventory adjustments slowing down. I mean, those don\u2019t tend to be fourth quarter unless there's another macro event that drives it. Those will adopt pretty quickly. That -- and we're seeing maybe some signs of that as we go forward. But we certainly don't see what these particular markets automotive electronics. They're forecasting, a stronger second half and we don't see the early indication of that yet. I think it makes sense to a degree what they're talking about, but not early days of April have we seen that.\nLaurence Alexander: And then just secondly on the litigation side. How much have you -- have you done a full scrub of the exposures? I mean, when you have a scientific -- culture scientific debate sometimes the debates look different after the fact. So have you gone through and just scrubbed the way the debates were handled within the firms so that there's no surprises as the litigation proceeds?\nMichael Roman: Lawrence, I would say this is a top priority, an issue for us as an enterprise and we are taking it with that in mind. And we have -- we formed a corporate affairs organization as part of our business realignment. Really it brought together a lot of the people that are working on this among other issues because there's broader brand and reputation strategy that they are focused on. But we have -- we've invested in I think a bigger capability around how do we look at it, how do we manage it, and how do we -- how we really take our brand reputation and take that forward as a company. So the answer is we are stepping up to it. It is emerging issue that has certainly gotten bigger as we went through the last year. And I would say we're stepping into it with every capability and with a lot of good counsel as well.\nLaurence Alexander: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, good morning.\nMichael Roman: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: So when I look at the annual bridge on EPS, I think you guys this year were planning on about $0.30 to $0.40 from transformation productivity and pension tailwind. Are you -- are those still isolated items? Are those still on track? \nNicholas Gangestad: Yes. Steve, the pension impact, the underlying business transformation productivity, the footprint action savings, those are all on track. But with the lower growth, the two things changing lower growth and all other productivity, those are the two components that are bringing that that part down, as well as the charge that we're anticipating in Q2 for the restructuring actions.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Yes. And that entire charge is coming in Q2. You're going to take that or run that through EPS?\nNicholas Gangestad: We think the majority of that \u2013 it could be all of it, but we think the majority that will be in there.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Can you just give us a little bit of color on what you kind of expect now for margins? Whether it's second quarter, the year, I mean, the more detail the better it is, so we call all kind of calibrate and reset ourselves from this level, operating margins.\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes. Steve, when we take into account our recent acquisition of M*Modal, when we take into account this restructuring charge, we are seeing margins down likely 100 basis points for the year, with those two items contributing just over half of that total decline in the margins. And that's different, where, from a three months ago, saying we were expecting margins to be up. The core underlying productivity, even with these actions we don't think it's going to be accretive to our margins yet this year. We think that will come later.\nSteve Tusa: Right. And one last quick one. So you mentioned Minnesota on the PFAS stuff. I thought you guys already took a charge for Minnesota. Was that \u2013 are you saying, we already took that charge, so we're just reminding you of it? Or was there an incremental charge in Minnesota?\nMichael Roman: Yes. Steve, it was -- I would say, a bit of a reminder. But it was \u2013 just to let you know, this encompasses those facilities. There is \u2013 there was a small part of it that just \u2013 is part of Minnesota as we look ahead. But it was \u2013 the 850 was the majority \u2013 the vast majority of what we faced in Minnesota.\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes. That charge -- the 850 is the last year, Steve. \nMichael Roman: Yes.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. No, no. I was just \u2013 I'm trying to, kind of, like, I just \u2013 I don't know whether the \u2013 I thought the 850 kind of ring-fenced it, for a lack of a better term. So the fact that there's kind of another charge in Minnesota, I'm just trying to kind of \u2013 I definitely haven't done \u2013 I'm not a lawyer, I don't know how to work on this. So I thought kind of the 850 took care of Minnesota.\nMichael Roman: Yes. And that's the way to think about it, Steve. We\u2026\nSteve Tusa: Okay.\nMichael Roman: This was just to make it complete, so that we didn't leave Minnesota out and then have it kind of question by exception.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys. Thanks for detail.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nNigel Coe: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nMichael Roman: Good morning, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Yes. Hi. I just want to pick up on Steve's point there. What was the trigger point to make this NRD charge probable and net submitable? I know there was a ruling in New Jersey. Was that the sole trigger point? Or was there something else that we're missing?\nMichael Roman: With the NRD I think really what you're talking about Nigel is a year ago. I think what you're really asking is, what's the triggering point for us to be taking this charge now in the first quarter. And we've been working on that with a number of the parties, where we have litigation going on. And we reached a point where we felt that based on the progression of those, the facts on those cases and where we stood with potential settlements, we actually did have some settlements occur in first quarter, which gave us better visibility in how to estimate more broadly across all our manufacturing sites, what we see is our liability.\nNigel Coe: Okay.\nMichael Roman: And by the way\u2026\nNicholas Gangestad: The New Jersey is not one of the places where we manufacture. That's a different lawsuit related to the use of the product and not related to our five manufacturing sites Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Okay that's great. And then just one quick one on kind of two key setup. You talked about maybe 100 basis points of channel, you've got the selling day headwind moves away 1Q to 2Q, but then we've got a type of comp about two or three points. Would you expect to have [ph] that 2Q would remain sort of in this low single-digit decline range?\nNicholas Gangestad: Nigel, it would not surprise me if we were looking at negative organic growth in the second quarter.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Thanks guys. Good luck.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Walsh: Hi. Good morning.\nMichael Roman: Hi John.\nJohn Walsh: I guess maybe just to follow-up on Nigel's question about that point of inventory. Does your guidance assume that that comes back i.e., there is some refill at some point in the year? Or is that contemplated as just these inventories are now going to remain where they are for the balance of 2019?\nMichael Roman: Yes, John it's really is the latter. So it's more a model of that remains. For inventory to come back there we would have to be a noticeable upturn in the market and that with some of the outlook for the second half that could be possible, but that's not what we're looking at. We're looking at the adjustment down levels out and we manage at that level as we go through the year.\nJohn Walsh: Got you. And then I guess can you give us an update on, there was a lot of focus at the Analyst Day on this $1 billion sales bucket of priority growth platforms. Can you give us an update of what they did in the quarter?\nMichael Roman: John, we'll update you maybe in more detail as we go forward. We saw very good progress across those priority growth platforms. There are two things that we measure. One is the revenue and the second is, are we making progress in the milestones so the product launches and the specifications. And you take automotive electrification and we saw significant wins in Q1 and new spec in business and we continue to see strong upper single double-digit growth even in that portfolio. And I would say across the businesses this has been one of the bright spots. When you look at quarter like this, there is a lot of challenges and it's disappointing, but there are some businesses and some bright spots and we had good business performance in our existing portfolios and we've certainly would count our priority growth platform as one of the positive contributors to growth and new products more broadly. But those priority growth platforms are even stronger. So we \u2013 I'm pleased with where we are. We're tracking to our plans and we can update individual programs when we talk to you.\nJohn Walsh: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.\nMichael Roman: Okay. Thank you. To wrap-up, we are moving with urgency and taking action to strengthen our performance in 2019, while investing for the future. I remain, confident in the world-class capabilities of our enterprise and in our 3M model. We know we have to rebuild our credibility. I'm confident we will get our performance back in line with the expectations of our investors. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you to please disconnect your lines."}], "2021": [{"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 4, "year": 2020, "date": "2021-01-26 17:33:08", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, January 26, 2021. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland: Thank you and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Let me begin today by expressing our sincere hope that you and your families continue to be safe and are doing well. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments, and then we'll open it up for questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com, under the heading quarterly earnings. Please turn to Slide 2. Before we begin, I would like to introduce the dates for 2021 quarterly earnings conference calls, which will be held on April 27, July 27, and October 26. The please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Finally, throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments in today's press release. Please note we have provided segment and total company adjusted EBITDA reconciliations for reference in today's press release attachments as part of our non-GAAP measures. Please turn to Slide 4, and I will hand it off to Mike. Mike?\nMike Roman: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The 3M team finished the year strong as we continue to execute well, innovate for our customers and fight the pandemic from every angle. In an uncertain economic environment, we delivered organic growth in all business groups and geographic areas, along with margin expansion, a double-digit increase in earnings and strong cash flow during the fourth quarter. Throughout 2020, I am proud of how 3M stepped up to help meet the extraordinary challenges facing the world, which includes our comprehensive response to COVID-19. Last year, we also took actions to transform for the future, advanced our core values and strengthen our balance sheet through robust cash generation. At the same time, we know that more work remains to deliver for our customers, shareholders and all stakeholders. Moving forward, we will build on our progress and continue to prioritize investments in growth, productivity and sustainability. 3M is well positioned as we head into 2021. And today, we are providing guidance for the year, where we expect a return to healthy growth. Overall, I'm confident in our ability to deliver a successful 2021, lead through the economic recovery and capitalize on opportunities from emerging trends that are favorable to 3M and our market-leading businesses. Please turn to Slide 5. Companywide total sales in the fourth quarter increased to $8.6 billion, with organic growth of 6% and earnings of $2.38 per share, up 22% year-on-year on an adjusted basis. Demand remains strong in end markets such as personal safety, home cleaning and semiconductors and we saw a sequential improvement in general industrial and automotive OEM. We also saw ongoing weakness in other end markets, including healthcare and oral care elective procedures, which declined sequentially, as it continued to be impacted by COVID-19. Geographically, organic growth was led by the Americas, up 8%, with the United States up 9%. EMEA grew 6% and Asia Pacific grew 2% with China up 14%. Our team delivered another quarter of good operational performance. We expanded our adjusted EBITDA margins to over 27%, with all business groups above 26% and increased our adjusted cash flow to $2.1 billion. That wraps up my opening comments. I will come back to discuss our full-year performance, along with my perspective on 2021, after Monish takes you through the details of the quarter. Monish?\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 6. Companywide fourth quarter sales were $8.6 billion, up 5.8% year-on-year. This result was better than we had anticipated. Our personal safety team continued to execute well in expanding respirator production to support pandemic-related demand. We also saw continued end market strength through year-end in automotive OEM, electronics and home improvement. Strong operating rigor and disciplined cost management drove robust adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion, up 20%, with adjusted operating margins of 21.5%, up 250 basis points year-on-year. On the right-hand side of this slide, you can see the components that impacted margins. Organic volume growth, along with our ongoing cost management and productivity efforts, were the biggest contributor to a margin improvement, adding 160 basis points. Included in this 160 basis point benefit were two items that I had called out during a conference in early December. First, we exited a product line within our closure, masking and packaging business and sold the related property in Q4. This resulted in a pre-tax gain of $54 million, or 60 basis points margin benefit. Please note that this gain is included in safety and industrial's Q4 operating income. And second, we had increased our respirator mask reserve by $107 million in Q4, which resulted in a 90 basis point headwind to margins year-on-year. For the full-year, we increased our respirator mask reserve by roughly $130 million, which is a little higher than the $100 million average over the last few years. This increase in our reserves is reflected in corporate and unallocated. As you may have noticed, adjusting for last year significant litigation charge, our fourth quarter corporate and unallocated expense was up approximately $100 million year-on-year. This increase was primarily driven by our update to our respirator mask reserve, along with impacts from ongoing legal costs, as we continue to manage PFAS and other legal proceedings. Turning to selling prices and raw materials, which was an 80 basis point year-on-year benefit to margins. This benefit was driven by the combination of higher selling prices and lower raw material cost versus last year's fourth quarter. Note, approximately half of our fourth quarter selling price performance was benefited by lower year-on-year volume-related customer rebates and markets that were most impacted by the pandemic. Acquisition and divestitures contributed 10 basis points year-on-year. Foreign currency net of hedging impacts decreased margins by 10 basis points. And lastly, while the fourth quarter pre-tax restructuring charge of $137 million was similar to last year's charge, restructuring provided a 10 basis point benefit to margins year-on-year due to this year's higher sales. Let's now turn to Slide 7 for a closer look at earnings per share. Fourth quarter earnings were $2.38 per share, up 22% from last year on an adjusted basis. First, as discussed on the prior slide, organic growth and ongoing cost management and productivity efforts delivered $0.43 per share to earnings growth. This included a $0.09 benefit from the gain on sale of property and a $0.10 headwind from the increased respirator mask reserved. Acquisitions and divestitures reduced earnings by $0.02 and foreign exchange impacts added $0.02 to per share earnings year-on-year. The strength of the 3M business model, strong cash flow and liquidity position gave us the opportunity in Q4 to retire $1 billion of debt early that was due to mature in 2021. As a result, we incurred higher net interest in the quarter, which combined with higher shares outstanding, reduced earnings by $0.03. Finally, a lower tax rate versus last year provided a $0.03 benefit to earnings per share. The lower tax rate was primarily a function of the mix of pre-tax income around the world. Please turn to Slide 8 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. We delivered another quarter of robust free cash flow with fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow of $2.1 billion, up 16% year-over-year, with conversion of 151%. Cash flows in the quarter were primarily driven by robust income and daily management of working capital. For the full-year, we generated adjusted free cash flow of $6.7 billion, up 18%. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $422 million and were $1.5 billion for the year. During the quarter, we returned $848 million to our shareholders via dividends and $3.4 billion for the year. Share repurchases remains suspended throughout the quarter given the continued global economic uncertainty. Our strong fourth quarter cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to strengthen our capital structure. We ended the quarter with $5.1 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand and reduce net debt by $1.3 billion or 9% sequentially. For the year, we improved our net debt position by $4.1 billion, or 23%. As a result, we exited the year with net debt to EBITDA of 1.5 down from 2.3 at the end of 2019. This significant improvement in our net debt position, along with a strong cash flow generation capability provides us increased financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities and return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure. Please turn to Slide 9 where I will summarize the business group performance for Q4. I will start with that Safety and Industrial business, which posted organic growth of 11.4% year-on-year in the fourth quarter. This result includes an approximate 10 percentage point benefit from pandemic related respirator mass demand. Overall, general industrial manufacturing activity continued to improve during Q4. However, customers and channel partners continue to remain cautious given ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Personal safety posted double digit organic growth year-on-year driven by continued demand for respirators. Industrial adhesives and tapes grew mid-single digits while the electrical markets business was up low single digits. The strong growth in the residential housing market continued to drive good performance and our roofing granules business which was up double digits organically versus Q4 of last year. The rest of the Safety and Industrial portfolio, namely automotive aftermarket, abrasives and closure and masking declined year-on-year. Safety and Industrial's fourth quarter segment operating margins were 27.7%, up 690 basis points driven by strong leverage on sales growth and continued productivity and spending discipline along with the previously mentioned gain on sale of real estate. Moving to Transportation and Electronics; after a challenging last two years, fourth quarter organic sales growth turned positive, up 1.4% as compared to last year. Our electronics related business was up 2% with continued strong growth in semiconductor, factory automation and data centers, which was partially offset by year-on-year softness in consumer electronics. Our auto OEM business was up 18% year-on-year compared to the 3% increase in global car and light truck builds. For the full year, our automotive business outperformed global builds by approximately 700 basis points. Advanced Materials and transportation safety return to growth year-on-year, driven by improving end market trends in automotive and highway infrastructure. Commercial solutions continued to be down year-on-year due to negative pandemic related impacts on advertising spend, and demand for workplace cleaning and safety products and solutions. Transportation and Electronics' fourth quarter operating margins were 21.8%, up 100 basis points on positive sales growth and continued cost discipline. Turning to Health Care; some parts of the world were challenged with rising COVID-19 cases throughout Q4. As a result, those health care providers experienced sequential declines in the elective procedure volumes, which negatively impacted parts of our business. At the same time, we continue to experience strong pandemic related demand for respirators to protect frontline health care workers, which more than offset the headwinds from the decline in elective procedure volumes. As a result, our Health Care business delivered fourth quarter organic sales growth of 6.6% versus last year. The medical solutions business grew low double digits, driven by continued strong respiratory demand. Excluding respirators organic growth in this business was flat. Our oral care business organic sales were flat year-over-year, as it dealt with rising COVID cases. The separation and purification business increased low double digits year-on-year. This business continues to experience solid demand for biopharma filtration solutions in support of the pharmaceutical industry's research and manufacturing efforts to develop vaccines and therapeutic treatments for COVID. Turning to Health Information Systems, which declined mid-single digits organically, as hospitals continued to remain cautious relative to the information technology investments. And finally, food safety was up low single digits organically versus last year. Health Care's fourth quarter operating margins were 24.7%, up 340 basis points year-on-year with adjusted EBITDA margins of 31.7%. Fourth quarter margins were driven by continued strong execution and cost management, which was partially offset by the higher year-on-year restructuring costs. Lastly, fourth quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was up 10% as retailers saw continued strong customer demand throughout the holiday season. Growth in this business continues to be driven by strong consumer demand for a category leading brands namely Filtrete, Scotch, Scotch blue, Scotch Brite, Command and McGuires. We also continue to see very strong growth in e-commerce channels, as the pandemic has accelerated years' worth of changes in consumer shopping behavior. Organic sales growth within consumer continued to be led by a home improvement and home care businesses each up double digits organically. Stationery and office declined low single digits as many business offices and schools remain partially or fully closed due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic. Consumer's operating margins were 23.5% or similar to last year. As we previously mentioned, we have been stepping up investments in advertising and merchandising and new product innovation to address changing consumer demand trends. Lastly, similar to Health Care, operating margins were impacted by higher year-on-year restructuring costs. That wraps up the review of fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 10. And I will hand it back over to Mike. Mike?\nMike Roman: Thank you, Monish. Looking at our 2020 performance, we posted an organic sales decline of 2% and adjusted earnings of $8.74 per share. We increased adjusted free cash flow by 18% to $6.7 billion with a conversion rate of 132% which demonstrates the strength of our business model, and our continued ability to perform across economic cycles. Additionally, we posted a good return on invested capital of 18% and expanded our adjusted EBITDA margins to over 27%, up 100 basis points year-on-year. Our strong cash flow along with disciplined capital allocation helped us reduce net debt by over $4 billion in the year. During the year, we strengthened our Health Care portfolio with a successful integration of Acelity and the completion of the divestiture of drug delivery. We returned $3.8 billion to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. And last year marked our 62nd consecutive year of dividend increases. Beyond financial results, 2020 was a year where 3M stepped up when we were needed the most. Please turn to Slide 11. Throughout the pandemic, 3Mers have been relentless in applying science to improve lives and make the world a better place. Our COVID-19 response has been guided by three priorities, protecting our employees, fighting the pandemic from every angle, and delivering for our customers and shareholders. Beginning last January, we immediately activated our surge capacity, and doubled our production of respirators to help protect nurses, doctors and first responders. We have since worked tirelessly to bring on more capacity, which includes additional investments from 3M and partnerships with governments at all levels. In total, last year, we produced and delivered 2 billion respirators globally, with approximately half in the United States. Today, we are at an annual run rate of 2.5 billion respirators, a fourfold increase versus 2019. At the same time, we've worked closely with governments, law enforcement and retailers to fight fraud. To date, we have helped identify more than 8 million counterfeit respirators, protecting health care workers from bad actors. Beyond providing respirators and other important personal protective equipment, we have helped the world recover in other ways. For example, our biopharma filtration solutions have enabled the development and manufacture of critical vaccines and therapeutics. We also took significant actions throughout the year to position ourselves for long-term growth and value creation. We continue to strengthen our innovation which remains at the center of our 3Mmodel. And last year, we invested $3.4 billion in the combination of research and development and CapEx. Our team also found ways to innovate differently and faster in response to the pandemic. And to serve growing market trends. We formed partnerships with other companies to expand respirator production. We introduced new daily face coverings, and we quickly adapted our cleaning product lines to serve new customers. We created new products to improve indoor air quality, biopharma filtration, and automotive electrification, just a few of our priority growth platforms. We rolled out cutting edge solutions to improve the performance of electric car batteries. One element of our work to enable more sustainable vehicle designs. For the full year, our priority growth platforms grew 7% outperforming the markets they serve. We also continue to see benefits from the global operating model we implemented last January. Our model enabled us to respond to the pandemic, with agility and resilience from our significant expansion of PPE production to our ability to maintain business continuity, serve our customers and ensure the integrity of our supply chain. Our enterprise operations team is applying learnings from our expansion of respirator production into other areas of 3M. For example, we are deploying new technology and using our analytic platforms to double our Filtrete capacity. We also took steps to optimize our model and further streamline our organization initiating a restructuring in December that will reduce annual operating costs by $250 million to $300 million. In summary, as I look across 2020, I am proud of our accomplishments and our people from the 50,000 3Mers in our factories, to our colleagues who volunteered to relocate and help scale up new respirator lines. To the retirees who came back to staff our hotline answering calls from home, people across 3M have stepped up to make a difference. And I thank our entire team for their incredible contributions in 2020. Please turn to Slide 12. We expect to deliver a strong performance in 2021 with organic growth of 3% to 6%; improved earnings, margin expansion and strong cash flow, and Monish will take you through the details shortly. We have aggressively prioritized investments throughout the pandemic, and we will accelerate our efforts in 2021. With ongoing focus on growth, productivity, and sustainability, we will increase investments in areas with strong growth opportunities such as personal safety, home improvement, and health care, with continued emphasis on our priority growth platforms. The rapid movement to an even more digital first world also opens additional opportunities for 3M. We are pioneering innovations that improve performance of data centers, and semiconductor manufacturing, which will be more relevant moving forward. We will also do more to leverage e-commerce along with digital technologies to better serve our customers. Ultimately, we have big opportunities to unleash 3M science and drive sustainable, long-term growth. And we will ensure that our teams have the resources to capitalize. We continue to advance the digitization of 3M, while also accelerating our use of data and analytics in everything we do. Further strengthening our supply chain is a priority in 2021. With a focus on highly sustainable, disruptive, and safe manufacturing technology, which will help us deliver on our promises to customers and shareholders. To that end, I want to close by talking about the commitments we will keep in 2021 and beyond leading our industry in science, society and sustainability. 3M science drives our business forward; we leverage and combine our technologies in unique ways across the company, creating new products and new lines of business. And we are positioned to do even more to deliver differentiated value for our customers into the future. In a similar way, 3M is partnering with our communities to improve society. In 2020, we took steps to advance our core values, including diversity, equity and inclusion. And in the coming year, we will hold ourselves accountable to new goals to support underrepresented groups at 3M, building on our recent progress. We will also be releasing a new Global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion report with details on our metrics. We remain committed to sustainability, which includes using science to proactively manage PFS, and to enable success in our ongoing work with communities and governments to advance our environmental stewardship. We will continue to increase investments to make our factories more sustainable, including $100 million in investments this year, which is included in our 2021 CapEx guidance to further reduce water usage and improve water quality around our manufacturing sites. To help address questions you have been asking, I would also like to touch on our strong history of working with governments and leveraging science to solve big challenges around the world. We have had productive conversations with President Biden's transition team and now the administration about their COVID-19 response. And we have open lines of communication. We will continue to do all we can to get respirators and other personal protective equipment to frontline workers and help America in the world beat the pandemic. On environmental stewardship, we share a common goal with governments of improving water quality, and doing so in a way that is based on sound science, established regulatory processes and collaboration with a broad range of stakeholders. We look forward to working with President Biden's administration and congressional leaders to pursue these shared goals, including through the remediation of PFAS where appropriate. And we aim to build on the successful public private partnerships that 3M has led globally throughout our history as a company. To wrap up, we are confident about what's ahead in 2021 and in our ability to create more value from the 3M model and build an even more competitive and sustainable enterprise. I will now turn the call over to Monish to cover the details of our guidance. Monish?\nMonish Patolawala: Thanks, Mike, please turn to Slide 13. As Mike mentioned, we are initiating full year 2021 guidance as end market visibility has continued to improve despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. As a result, we will no longer be reporting monthly sales updates as we had in 2020. Looking at sales; we are forecasting total sales growth of 5% to 8% with organic growth in the range of 3% to 6%. Earnings per share is projected to be between $9.20 and $9.70, or up 5% to 11% on an adjusted basis. The primary contributors to earnings growth in 2021 include organic sales growth, productivity as we continue to increase our focus on operating rigor through daily management and leveraging the use of data and data analytics, and our ongoing efforts to advance and streamline our global operating model. And lastly, we anticipate benefits from foreign currency due to the weaker US dollar. Partially offsetting these benefits are anticipated year-on-year headwinds from the Q4 2020 gain on sale of real estate and expected increase in areas such as travel, variable incentive compensation and advertising and merchandising investments. Turning to cash, we expect another year of robust cash flow, with free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%. From a capital allocation perspective, our first priority remains investing organically in our business, including R&D and CapEx. As we have noted, we are increasing investments in growth, productivity and sustainability in 2021. As a result, CapEx for the year is expected to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Returning cash to shareholders remains a high priority for 3M including both dividends, along with a disciplined approach to share repurchases, which we plan to restart in 2021. Please see the appendix in today's slide presentation for additional details regarding our 2021 full year guidance. Please turn to Slide 14. Here you see a breakdown of our expectations for organic growth by business group along with some of the key macroeconomic and market indicators we incorporated into our planning. Overall, the pace and success of the COVID-19 vaccine deployment and adoption will be critical for the global economy. The two broadest macroeconomic indicators, Global GDP and IPI are both expected to grow mid-single digits. The overall electronics market is expected to be up mid-single digits. In addition, global car and light truck builds are expected to grow 14% versus 2020. Also, while health care and oral care elective procedure volumes have improved off the Q2 lows of 2020. They are currently not expected to return to pre-COVID levels until the later part of 2021. We are also monitoring the ability and pace for people to return to the workplace and students to return to school. And finally, consumer spending, particularly retail sales and home improvement demand, and e-commerce also are factors in our planning. Taking these factors into account, we expect the following organic growth expectations for our business groups in 2021. Starting with safety and industrial, where we anticipate organic local currency growth to be up mid-single digits, transportation and electronics is expected to be up low to high single digits. This vital range contemplates the potential for end market variability, particularly in automotive and electronics. And finally, both our health care and consumer businesses are projected to grow in the low to mid-single digits this year. In 2021, we will prioritize capital to our greatest market opportunities. Deliver for our customers, drive commercial intensity, improve operating rigor, enhance daily management, leverage data and data analytics and continue to streamline our organization. As a result, we expect solid revenue growth; improve margins and earnings, robust free cash flow and a continued strong capital structure and financial flexibility. To wrap up; in the spirit of continuous improvement, there's always more we can do and will do. I would like to thank all 3Mers for the hard work and the progress that we have made in an unprecedented year. With that, I thank you for your attention. And we will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nMike Roman: Hey, Deane.\nMonish Patolawala: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Hey, it's nice to see you guys back in the guidance business. But I have to admit I'm going to miss those monthly sales updates. First question for Monish. Can you comment on the \u2013 how the company has been benefiting from lowered temporary cost, no travel or less travel trade shows and so forth? And for 2021, what assumptions are you making about how do these temporary costs start to get feathered back in?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes, so I would just say, Dean, thanks for the question. And as you know, we've done a great job as a team trying to keep up costs under control. You can see that in Q3 results. You can see that in Q4. How it will bounce back will actually all depend on where we see the recovery of the pandemic and how the vaccine plays itself out. Currently, as you can see from the guidance that we've given you, there is headwind that we're planning on the bounce back of $0.35 to $0.45 that was put in there. And there are two or three things in there, Dean. One is, as you think about the property sales that are year-over-year, that are non-repeat. Secondly, all these indirect costs, travel is a big piece of that that comes back. And the third one is the variable compensation that gets reset for 2021. And from 4Q to 1Q, also there will be a reset and an increase in cost. So those are the factors we're looking at. And I would just say from a quarter perspective, it's all going to depend on our how revenue comes across, how growth happens, how the economy recovers. The other piece, just to keep in mind, as Mike mentioned, our plan is to invest more in opportunities on growth, productivity and sustainability. And that also will have an impact on each quarter, depending on how the economy recovers.\nDeane Dray: That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, and just broadly, I really appreciate all the work that 3M has done with regard to wrapping up the respirator mask capacity and how you've responded, that's been terrific. Just want to express my appreciation. Can you comment on any updates on the MIT collaboration and the rapid test system that you have in development?\nMike Roman: Yes. Sure, Dean, thanks for that question. Our team has been working with MIT researchers, as we've talked about, really focused on developing a low-cost rapid detection capability for COVID-19. And over the past nine months, we've made some very significant technical advances in the design. And we're bringing our expertise in manufacturing and scaling up working with MIT with their capabilities and technology around the assay, the measurement development. And we've been focused on some of the challenges that are inherent in this kind of development, which is the stability of the tests and the robustness of the device, and improving sensibility, sensitivity in the detection. And we're in the middle of the development phase. We're working to address those challenges. We've made very good progress. We'll continue to update as we go along and we're continuing to be very, very encouraged by the partnership with MIT.\nDeane Dray: What would be the optimistic view on a rollout?\nMike Roman: Well, we're in development. We\u2019ve got to resolve some of the requirements that are here around sensitivity and stability of the device. So we're in the middle of that. Well, as soon as we get further along, I would say, in the development phase, we will give you a better view of timelines.\nDeane Dray: Appreciate it. Best of luck to everyone.\nMike Roman: Thanks, Deane.\nMonish Patolawala: Thanks, Deane.\nOperator: Thank y ou. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Good morning, guys.\nMike Roman: Hey, Scott.\nMonish Patolawala: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Davis: I want to just dig in on the T&E guide a little bit. I mean, it's a kind of drive a truck through that low to high range. And when I look at it at least and based on what we've seen this quarter, it seems like the bias could be a little bit more to the higher side of that. Is there something that concerns you? Perhaps maybe emerging market recovery or something like that that concerns you that make you a little bit more conservative on that specific segment?\nMike Roman: Well, Scott, I'll start with something Monish said, it's great to see this business turn positive in Q4. It's a very good business that faces into markets that have very innovative customers and segments. And it's a good opportunity for us to continue to grow and leverage our innovation. As we look into 2021, we see some positive outlooks. We saw and highlighted some of the strength in semiconductor and in automotive build rates turning positive in Q4, that's expected to continue to get better in 2021. I would say there's - we start with - there's some uncertainty on how that's going to play out as we start the year. COVID is still the driving factor here, what is the visibility through that. I think we get better clarity on the plans of our customers and how they're thinking about it. There's still that uncertainty around the pandemic and how that plays out even in those areas. You see some of that, and I'll look of maybe some softness in consumer electronics, as we start the year. We also - as a reminder in this business, we have exposure to oil and gas and highway infrastructure and commercial solutions, which really depends on people in the office working in the office and in commercial settings. So there's a balance across those businesses with the view of the uncertainty in how the pandemic is going to play out and we'll get better clarity as we go through the year.\nMonish Patolawala: I would just add Scott to everything Mike said. I would just add the supply chain stability in the electronics and the auto OEM market, also something that we are watching. So as that plays out and that gets more stable, I think it'd give us more stability and certainty on how we're going to deliver against it.\nScott Davis: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I mean are there any tangible PFAS milestones in 2021 that you guys can remind us of?\nMike Roman: Well, Scott, we've continue to...\nScott Davis: Anything at all where we can get some more color?\nMike Roman: Yes, I would say, for us, we continue to focus on proactively managing PFAS. And that we've got three principles, and one of those is providing transparency to you and our investors. And right now, there had been scheduled some initial bellwether case in Michigan that's been postponed, it's still to be determined when that'll be scheduled. So we'll update as we go. We do continue to keep our 3m.com site updated with all recent PFAS information. And we'll continue to update on whether it's litigation, our work or our work in support of regulatory standards. Any of those categories we will update there and we\u2019ll update in these calls as well.\nScott Davis: Okay. Thank you. Good luck, guys.\nMike Roman: Thank you.\nMonish Patolawala: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question,\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nMike Roman: Hey, Joe.\nMonish Patolawala: Hey, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey, maybe my first question, just trying to understand, obviously, great ending to the year from an organic growth standpoint. I'm trying to understand, I guess, like, what's embedded from a cadence perspective, as we progress through 2021? And then secondly, is it - there was some pandemic-related benefits that you received in 2020? I'm just wondering what your base case expectation is for 2021? Is there - is it a headwind? Is it neutral, just trying to understand that better?\nMonish Patolawala: So I'll try again, Joe, I think you're asking what our cadence is and how we're going to look at 2021. So what we're going to, we're going to be as helpful as we can, as you know, Joe, we have initiated annual guidance, and based on where we see some of the end markets that I mentioned about in my prepared remarks. Based on that we'll see where - how those end markets play out that will determine how our quarterly things play out. Our guidance is right now organic 3% to 6% with 5% to 8% growth in total, including FX. One of the things that we have seen over the pandemic, Joe, is our normal trends that historically you would see don't seem to play itself out. So for example, in December, the company usually sees deceleration we didn't see the deceleration. Similarly, on a month-to-month trend, sometimes what you see in variability in the months was higher due to COVID and therefore, my personal belief is I think you're going to see more variability throughout the year depending how different parts of the world play itself out. We are also aggressively prioritizing our investments throughout on all the three items Mike mentioned growth, productivity and sustainability. Again, that will have an impact based on how revenue plays itself out. We would love to go heavy and invest early so that we can capture the growth that's coming. But we'll have to see how the world recovers. So we'll have to just walk through that. And then just another piece for you to keep in mind, as you're thinking about the quarters is from a restructuring charge perspective, we had announced the charge in the fourth quarter, you're going to see the balance of that charge somewhere between $110 million to $160 million in the second half of this year. And we'll tighten that as we go through the quarter. So our goal is to be as helpful as we can, throughout and through the various interactions we have with all of you is to tell you what's going on in the world. But that's the way we see it right now. So hopefully I answered your question, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Yes, Monish, that's helpful, and maybe just my follow-on question, since you mentioned the restructuring, you did announce the call it $75 million to $100 million in benefits, that we're going to impact 2021. I guess how do we think about that in the context of some of the temporary cost actions that are reversing fully recognizing that the investments that you've just laid out, are likely going to be dependent on how the volume shakeout?\nMike Roman: Yes, it's a great one, Joe. And the same thing we keep thinking about all the time of how do we do it. So we have tried on our, on one of the presentation pages, there's a guide out there, where we show you headwinds is $0.35 to $0.45, and the benefit from restructuring is anywhere between $0.20 to $0.30. If you think about the headwinds, as I mentioned before, there's property sales that don't repeat some of the indirect costs that was snapped back. Example, travel and variable compensation is in that range of $0.35 to $0.45. And then on the restructuring side, the $0.20 to $0.30, I would ask you to think about two pieces. One is for all the other actions that the companies had taken other than the fourth quarter, there's a carryover benefit of give or take $100 million. And then the benefits of the restructuring that we announced in the fourth quarter are another $75 million of benefits $75 million to $100 million. And then, of course, it's offset by the charge that we're going to take a $110 million to $160 million. So that's why we have called out the restructuring benefits in the guide of $0.20 to $0.30.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe, hey, maybe just the first question on just the firm wide adjusted sort of operating margin expansion for 2021 that's dialed in. So I see all those moving parts on Slide 21, which is very helpful. So maybe thinking about it just differently from a sort of P&L standpoint, I think your adjusted EBIT margin in 2020 was around sort of between 21% and 21.5% maybe, if you could just confirm that. And then of that base, what level of margin expansion you dialing in for 3M in 2021 at the midpoint of the guidance, let's say.\nMonish Patolawala: Sure, Julian. I would say a couple of things. So first, just answer your question to give you the 20% to 21.5%. That's correct. So it's 21, 3 is the perfect number. If you think about 2021 ad how we look at margin, I'll just elevate first to say our general view over the long term is growth at or about macro, sustainable margin improvement; strong cash that ultimately helps us have a very strong capital structure. So keeping that in mind, we would say that's basically how we are thinking about long term, things to factor in from a margin guide perspective, as Mike mentioned, we are going to invest properly in growth, productivity and sustainability. So that's going to have one factor. The second factor is going to be the amount of productivity that we are generating. We've got a lot of proprietary technologies that we are rolling out in supply chain. Mike mentioned that the stability of our supply chain is one of our priorities for 2021. We're going to continue that path. So you should see benefit from the productivity actions that the supply chain team is driving. The third piece is making sure that we have factored in correctly the snap back of 2020 costs. We have shown you that it's $0.35 to $0.45 of headwind again on the three items that I mentioned before, and I would say the last one to think about this is thinking about what revenue is going to be and what growth looks like quarter-to-quarter. And that's going to also have a pretty big impact on where we end up from a margin perspective. So those are all the factors that we are putting in here as we think about but long-term growth at or about macro, sustainable margin improvements, and then strong cash.\nJulian Mitchell: I see. So, Monish, is around the sort of plus 30, 40 basis points margin expansion is that the rough ballpark then putting in all of those different pieces.\nMonish Patolawala: So I go back again, Julian, I would say it all depends on where revenue ends up being and where - how much we invest. So it all depends on how fast the world recovers.\nJulian Mitchell: Fair enough. And then just the second topic quickly, you'd alluded in the prepared remarks to the buyback perhaps resuming clearly the balance sheet starting to look under levered and very good free cash flow last year. You're not dialing in much in the way of share count reduction on that Slide 21. So maybe help us understand what scale of buybacks you might be contemplating for the year?\nMonish Patolawala: Sure. The way that we look at it, Julian, is our first step in all of this is to make sure that we are investing organically R&D and CapEx, you're seeing us increase capital expenditure at $1.8 billion to $2 billion because we see some growth opportunities, some productivity opportunities, as well as sustainability. Our second priority is dividends and making sure that our shareholders think that's important. We acknowledge that our third priority is M&A. And then our last priority share buyback. So we as I said in my prepared remarks at 3M, we understand returning cash to shareholders is important. So we have both, we're going to dividend as well, as we have always supported a reasonable amount of share buyback. And that's our current plan. How much and how that plays out from a timing perspective is again goes back to where we see where the economic recovery is going to look like. And then based on that we'll work it with the board, and we'll keep y'all posted as we announced.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. Hi, I just wanted to go back to the increase investments comments. So just go into your 2021 EPS Bridge; the $0.47 of organic growth, I think that kind of recap, and it's down to like a sub 30% of in gross margin. So it feels like this investment spending gains that. Just want to confirm that. And are we thinking about R&D to kind of get back to that 5.5% - 6% of sales kind of range in 2021?\nMike Roman: Is a question, Nigel, are we getting back to 5.5% to 6% of sales R&D? Is that the question?\nNigel Coe: That's part and then would that investment spent be against your organic growth bucket?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes, so I would say, listen, R&D right now is I would say is in that range. But it always goes back to the point Mike made, which is our plan is to keep investing in growth, productivity and sustainability. On the growth side, we have so many good opportunities, whether it's home care, personal safety, digital, health care, data analytics, as well as auto OEM. From an electrification perspective, we have tremendous opportunities of growth. And depending on how we see 2021, and then 2022 and beyond play out, we won't be shy to invest in those areas, we won't be shy to invest in advertising and merchandising too as required in our businesses to make sure that we capture for the long-term growth. So I would say that yes, but I would also ask us to start thinking to be four great businesses and depending on how the end markets play out in those four businesses, we're going to flex up or down. So I don't know if I answered your question, Nigel, but that's the way I look at it from an R&D perspective.\nNigel Coe: Yes, I think so. I think that's good answer. And then on the pricing side, obviously, we saw a pickup in pricing, especially in T&E, I think, EMEA is [Indiscernible] in the quarter. You talked about reduced discounting activity because of COVID which makes a lot of sense. I'm just wondering if we can just talk about raw pricing. So are you increasing pricing responds to the raw material inflation and maybe just a little bit color around that will be helpful?\nMonish Patolawala: Sure. So we are seeing inflation. One of the things about 3M is we buy so many diverse products, there's not one product that's greater than $200 million to $300 million that's - that has a big impact. But we are seeing I would say inflation in three areas. Area number one is just raw material and feed. Couple of them we look at is polypropylene, wood pulp, ethylenes are areas that we look at and say all of them are showing inflation. The second is as you're seeing also from different industrials is logistics cost is higher, whether it's air or truck, the logistics costs are higher. So we're seeing inflation there. And the third piece even though the economies still are not that very strong from a labor shortage perspective, that's another area where we're seeing inflation and manpower cost. So those are the three areas that we are seeing, we have a great sourcing team that's working to minimize that as much as they can. And then also your specific question on pricing. Our aim is to have prices that will go up on a year-over-year to take into account the inflation that we're seeing.\nOperator: Our next line comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Hi, guys. Good morning. I had just sort of a softer question. I think 3M is going through a period where there are a lot of changes happening below the surface, which are sort of less than apparent to us looking from the outside. But you have new systems; you have sort of this new structure where organization is much more globally focused. Can you just talk to us, as 2020 evolved how did it change your planning process? And how did it impact your planning process going into 2021?\nMike Roman: Yes, Andrew, thanks for the question. We have even in the middle of the pandemic we've continued to make very good progress on some of what you outline there. And part of it is the digitization of 3M, transforming our company deploying new ERP and ecosystem around it that continues to move forward. We are also now operating for one year, our new operating model that we launched in January of 2020. And that we moved ahead in the middle of the pandemic, we benefited from it, we saw the benefits come in our ability to respond to just the dynamics that we hit. It's on our markets as we went through the year. So I would say we benefited from it, it validated where we are going with the 3M model, it validated the strengths of the 3M model and how we apply our innovation in our markets. And I would say it encouraged us to continue to really press ahead, and I talked about that in my prepared remarks about the digitization, improving our operations, I see it in terms of more agility, shorter cycle times, improved response. And ultimately, it's really at the foundation of how we drive productivity, operational improvements as we go. So that's becoming the way we take advantage of it. That's how we focus it. And so planning broadly, as part of that we're getting, I would say better in terms of cycle times. And I better at using the greater visibility on data and the analytics that go with it. So it's, I'm encouraged with the progress we've made. And I believe there's more to come as we go through 2021.\nMonish Patolawala: Andrew, I would just add, I've been here only six months. So just to tell you the changes that I've seen in the six months I've been here. There's a lot more focus on daily management, are we winning daily? Are we not winning daily, much more tie into what external market trends that we are seeing, so we can quickly react as needed? You can see the work the supply chain teams have done to keep our supply chain lines running despite supply chains in general being broken. I look at also the ability to see visibility of data. So there's data democratization, where we can see stuff that is happening much faster on a daily basis. So it's all about driving the operating rigor getting the daily management quickly going into root cause and then finding sustainable improvements. Here we're using, so I think there's much more transparency on issues that we are facing and the team is going in eyes wide open and trying to find solutions as quickly as we can.\nAndrew Obin: And just follow up question; you're sort of highlighted, like the procedure slow down. But if I look at medical solutions that were probably driven by Acelity I guess on oral care, you said it down organically, but I think reported number is still up. Can you just talk about where is organic growth for product lines like Acelity and Tegaderm and how do you expect them to sort of evolve into the second half of the year?\nMonish Patolawala: Sure. So Acelity I would say is one of the divisions that does get impacted, the highest due to hospitalization rate and elective surgeries but overall when you just step back and say what is Acelity done? I would say as the volumes came up in Q2, off Q2 lows the business has continued to grow tremendously through those Q2 lows, the reason why Acelity is so good for 3M, I think there are a couple of things. One is it's in a market that is ever growing right now based on where our demographics are. Secondly, it gives 3M a lot more relevance when it comes to talking to caregivers. Third is it gets us into a post-acute space and a home care space, which I think post-COVID is going to be a trend from a home care perspective. And then what 3M brings to Acelity is the synergies that it can bring one is its brand, its global reach, and its ability to do global and high-speed manufacturing. It brings it to that and 3M did already have an advanced wound care business. So when you put this together, it basically makes it a very good acquisition for 3M. We have seen growth in both. We have made positive income in third and fourth quarter. And we are very encouraged with all the work that the health care team is doing that this business will keep growing. But of course, it will be partially dependent on how the world recovers from electives.\nAndrew Obin: And is Tegaderm, are they comp positive or still negative?\nBruce Jermeland: Andrew, I think we have to get back to you.\nMonish Patolawala: Unfortunately I don't have that handy. Sorry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, guys, good morning. I'm going to disagree with Dean for once and say I'm glad we're not getting the monthly sales. Just it's I'm in favor of less work, less work these days. Given the industry trends, that's negative productivity for us. On that side, that productivity bucket for you guys, the $0.20 to $0.35 for this year. Where did that end up for? I know this is kind of a messy bridge for 2020. But where did that number end up for 2020?\nMonish Patolawala: You are saying the full year 2020?\nSteve Tusa: Yes, the full year 2020 kind of productivity bucket.\nMonish Patolawala: So the leverage, I think if my memory is right was landed up somewhere. Again, it's so messy with all the indirect snap backs and in and out of 2020 and what we did by quarter-to-quarter timing, et cetera. But I would just say, Steve, in general, you should just think about the leverage range for 3M in the range of 30% to 40% from an incremental volume perspective.\nSteve Tusa: Okay, that's helpful. And then within the organic growth assumption, what are you assuming for price?\nMonish Patolawala: So as I said before on the earlier question that was there. We expect prices to be positive based on all the inflation that we are seeing. And historically, when you think about what 3M has been able to do, they have been able to get price just because of the value that they add to customers. And I don't expect that to change.\nSteve Tusa: So like 50 to 100 bps something in that range.\nMonish Patolawala: Well, historically 3M, if my memory is right and Bruce can correct me it has been in the range of 30 to 50 basis points excluding electronics, which electronics as you know an industry that definitely sees price decrease, but we'll have to see where inflation ends up here. And we'll do the best we can.\nSteve Tusa: Okay, and then one last one, just for maybe Mike. DuPont had some news around PFAS recently. Can you just kind of help put that in context? Is that kind of meaningless for you guys because you're on like a very different glide path with your exposures there? I don't know what kind of color you can provide is as far as helping frame that kind of read across to you guys.\nMike Roman: Yes, Steve, and we did see their press release. And we won't comment on the agreement that they've announced. I would just reinforce what I've been saying is we are committed to proactively manage PFS, and the three principles are the way we think about this. Sound science and how can we apply that in our 3M expertise to move ahead. Our corporate responsibility and we're stepping into that with where we manufactured, historically manufactured and dispose the PFS and then transparency and keeping you and our investors updated on what we are seeing and how we progress. And that's something that we'll continue to focus on as we go through the year. So that's probably where I'll leave it for now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh from Credit Suisse.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning, everyone. Maybe just a different way to ask this PFS question and also a follow on to the capital allocation question, but I think in response you said the economic recovery is what going to govern your expectations around the pace of share repurchases. I guess the follow-on question to that is, are any expectations around PFAS timing factoring into that? Or is it really about the economic recovery?\nMonish Patolawala: So I would say, John, we always take multiple factors into account as needed. Right now, one of the big factors is the pace of the core economy. But as things evolve, and things change, we'll definitely update you on our guidance.\nJohn Walsh: Okay and then maybe just a question for Mike. We've seen it from several others; obviously you're an integrated material science company. But could you talk about any potential pruning, as you look forward? And if that's a lever, that 3M still has available to pull?\nMike Roman: Yes. And, John, you're talking about portfolio when you ask the question. Correct.\nJohn Walsh: Yes. Not like, obviously, your models integrated. But are there things still around the edges or maybe even a little bit chunkier in terms of pruning that you would consider?\nMike Roman: Well, I would say we continue, and even through 2020, in the middle of COVID, we continue to actively manage our portfolio and we focus on three priorities, when we think about that. One is prioritizing where we invest organically, so the 5.5% to 6% on R&D is not everywhere the same, we are prioritizing where we're making investments, you'll see that in capital investments as well. So we use portfolio to dry that first and foremost, that's our priority in our capital allocation. Then we look at complimentary acquisitions. And Acelity as Monish talked earlier, that's a great example of that strategy. And we're focused on Acelity. We continue to be active and looking at M&A. We're focused on Acelity as we come into 2021. And then we do have a, I would say, a rigorous approach to optimizing value in each of our businesses. And this includes what we might do to change the model, or if there's a better owner or more value to be created, we would this would include divestitures, as we've done, as we did with our drug delivery business in 2020. So it's an ongoing process. We continue to assess it. When we see an opportunity to increase value, we'll take action as we have.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, guys. Mike, you seem relatively confident in ongoing recovering and in the past, you've said that you don't really see the recovery as a restocking. So maybe give us some more color into where you think inventory is pulling both the channel and at 3M at this point.\nMike Roman: Yes. Andy, I would say we're seeing what you're hearing and probably seeing more broadly, and that starts with the second half of 2020, where more I would say the channels across our various markets began to stabilize, as we went through the second half into the end of the year. And so if you look at our four go-to-market models, they each have a little different dynamic, the safety and industrial business. Our channel partners remained cautious there, you're seeing continued demand for us in safety and personal protective equipment. We saw some improvement in our industrial adhesives and tapes business as we went through Q4. Other businesses are still seeing end market declines. And so we're not seeing material restocking in those safety or industrial channels globally. Transportation, electronics, they're pretty much in balance with demand, there's some tight supply and Monish mentioned supply chain things that we're watching everybody's watching around semiconductor and that does relate to the strong demand in their end markets. Health care generally steady as the end markets have now adjusted to the changes in areas like elective procedures in the middle of COVID. There's Q4 we kind of saw a resurgence of COVID cases impact that but pretty steady as we come into the year. And consumer is I would say mixed, we see high demand in home improvement that continues. That's lower-than-normal levels in that channel. And we see really elevated levels still in office and retail as you seen the slowdown because of the work remotely kind of economy that we're in. So it's a little mixed, in general, we're not seeing a strong restocking as we come into the year.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Mike, that's helpful then a follow up would be on sort of respirator side. I might have missed this but I think you mentioned 350 basis points of tailwind in Q4. A little higher than you had guided; are you still increasing capacity in respirators and then these other areas that you've experienced pandemic tailwind? And then what kind of line of sight do you have as you - if you do - if you are increasing capacity, I mean, it seems like respirator demand can last well into 2022 at this point.\nMike Roman: Andy, we did bring online in the US, we talked a lot about this as we went through the year, capital that we invested in and capital that we invested in a public private partnership with DOD. And that is all online, we did realize some improved productivity on those lines, we've been working even as we bring on new capital to drive greater throughputs and yields and rates and we had some improvement from that. We did, as we got through Q4 get to full capacity and full run rates. And so that's $2.5 billion run rate that I talked about, we're going to - we will continue to strive to improve on that as we go through the year. We are - we still see strong demand around the world where we will continue to do everything we can to meet that demand. And we're at like I said, at full capacity of the new lines. And we can, will incrementally add to that as we go through the year.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank.\nNicole DeBlase: Yes, thanks for squeezing me in. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the first quarter if there's any color you guys can give. I know we've gone back to kind of the normal annual cadence. But given that things are still kind of crazy with respect to COVID. Not a ton of visibility, kind of the mix between what you're seeing on the industrial side versus PPE. Is there any way you can kind of frame for us? Either what you're seeing in January or thoughts around the organic outlook for the first quarter?\nMonish Patolawala: Sure, Nicole, it's a question that we keep asking ourselves and try to get as much visibility as we can. As you correctly stated, there's a lot of uncertainty right now in the world. As we saw end markets starting to stabilize, and our visibility got better, we started an annual guidance of 3% to 6%. And I think as the world recovers, we should be able to get there, we are confident that innovation that we are doing should help us get to solid growth and grow that are about macro in the long run. When you think about 1Q, one of the things that we have seen over the last six months that I've at least been here and longer for these teams are some of the historical trends have just not played themselves out. So December didn't slow down, as historically has been. With that said, I don't think January has started off very weak. But the things that we are watching are where does hospitalization go? What happens to elective procedures both in the hospital and the oral care space? So we're pretty cautious in that and seeing what we're seeing right now. On the industrial side, making sure that industrial activity continues, our customers continue to buy inventory will be the second piece that we got to watch. Third, as I've mentioned on the auto side, and on the electronic side, where both of them are starting to combine together, how does the supply chains play itself out and what the volume of auto production is going to be? And then the last one to think about is from a consumer perspective, we had an extremely strong consumer growth. You saw we grew nearly 10% with a very strong holiday season. The question is does that strength continue in retail when do schools reopen? Also, just a reminder, from a tactical basis, we are hitting that point where we start lapping year-over-year pandemic demand. So 3M had nearly $100 million of disposable respirator sales last year 1Q, 2020. Again driven by the pandemic so we are lapping that. And then on the income side to think through, Nicole, what is the volume going to look like? And I mentioned we're quite cautious on what we're seeing. And then just on the tactical side, what else we're going to invest, how fast we're going to invest in each of the quarters in the areas Mike mentioned. And then from a year - quarter-over-quarter sequential basis as we reset variable compensation for the first quarter as well as we start stepping into advertising merchandising investments, we will have an impact. So hopefully I gave you the things we are looking at Nicole as we're thinking about the quarter.\nNicole DeBlase: Yes, that's perfect. And just one follow up the outlook for free cash flow. Can you guys just talk about what you see with respect to networking capital and the opportunity to reduce factory inventories 3M in 2021?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes, so I would say, Nicole, improving velocity working capital turnover, whichever terminology you want to use is one of our priorities. There is a good opportunity there. You've seen the team has done a really nice job from Q2 highs of where the inventory was as a percent of sales or even if you look at days on hand, to bring it down in Q3, and Q4. The work that the team is doing with data, data analytics, but also putting enterprise operations and supply chain together is an area that I would say is an opportunity for us in 2021 and beyond to keep improving inventory velocity. And we are committed to doing that and we'll keep driving that.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.\nMike Roman: To wrap up, in Q4 and throughout 2020, our team executed well and continue to fight the pandemic from every angle, while building for the future and advancing our values. As we look ahead, we will apply 3M science to capitalize on global market trends and prioritize investments in growth, productivity and sustainability. We enter 2021 well positioned to generate greater value for our customers and shareholders and deliver a strong performance.

Please turn to slide 4, and I will hand it off to Mike. Mike?\nMike Roman: Good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy, and I thank you for joining us. As you have seen in our monthly sales reports, we saw a significant improvement sequentially in trends versus Q2 across businesses and geographies and we returned to positive year-over-year organic growth. While we remain in a highly uncertain economic environment, it is a credit to our team that 3M continues to execute well, deliver value to our customers, and fight the pandemic from every angle. We continue to prioritize protecting our employees, frontline health care workers and the public, while supporting the reopening of economies around the world. We have distributed 1.4 billion respirators year-to-date on track to two billion by the end of 2020. And we will exit the year at an annual run rate of 2.4 billion as we continue to add capacity. 3M innovations are also supporting the development of new vaccines and lower cost testing methods that can be mass produced. Our operational performance was strong and we posted another quarter of robust cash flow aggressively managed costs and further strengthened our balance sheet. Though our focus remains on executing in this environment, we are also looking ahead and investing in both growth and productivity, while advancing our core values including sustainability, diversity and inclusion. Overall, we are confident in our ability to lead in the economic recovery as we take actions to transform 3M and realize new opportunities from emerging customer needs and global market trends. Please turn to slide 5. Company wide total sales increased 5% year-over-year and 16% sequentially to $8.4 billion, slightly above our estimates. With respect to organic sales, we delivered growth of 1% year-over-year with adjusted earnings of $2.43 per share. In the third quarter, demand remains strong in personal safety along with areas such as home improvement, data centers and biopharma filtration, and we see continued momentum in these end markets into October. While we saw improvement in other end markets versus the second quarter, many remain down year-over-year, including health care elective procedures, auto OEM and general industrial. Geographically, we experienced notable improvement in the Americas, led by the U.S., up 5% organically with strong growth in personal safety, consumer and health care. EMEA was flat versus down 15% in Q2, while Asia Pacific was down 3% organically. We delivered growth of 8% in China with all business groups above 6% offset by Japanm which continues to be challenged. Our execution was strong as we posted adjusted EBITDA margins of 29% with all business groups at/or above 27%. Our adjusted free cash flow increased to $2.2 billion in the quarter. Year-to-date we have expanded cash flow by 19% and are on track to deliver another record performance in 2020. Continued strong cash flow has enabled us to reduce net debt by $2.8 billion, while returning $2.5 billion in dividends to shareholders through the first 9 months of the year. Looking ahead, this continues to be an uncertain environment and customers and channel partners remain cautious. We will stay focused on serving our customers, driving operational improvement and investing for the future. Please turn to slide 6. Over the past several months, customer and stakeholder trust in 3M has grown because of how we have delivered through the pandemic. COVID-19 is rapidly changing the global economy and the way people live, work and communicate. Years worth of changes are unfolding in a matter of months, creating opportunities to unleash the power of 3M science to drive sustainable long-term growth. For example, with people at home more, there is growing demand for products to both maintain and improve households. This includes indoor air quality solutions where we've increased investments in our Filtrete portfolio to introduce new innovative products and create additional capacity. As a result, our air quality platform has grown double-digits year-to-date as we keep families healthier and more productive and we expect this market trend to continue. An increased focus in other areas like personal safety, automotive electrification and biopharma filtration to name a few also open additional opportunities for 3M. At the same time, end markets like office, hospitality and oil and gas have been highly impacted by COVID-19 and are declining as a result. To strengthen our competitive edge, we will invest where demand is strong, pull back where needed, stay close to our customers and create new innovations that address global market trends. We execute these strategies in normal times, but in the unprecedented times, we are in now prioritization is especially important. I'm also encouraged with the benefits from the new global operating model we implemented this year, a significant step in our transformation designed to improve growth and efficiency and allow us to adjust faster than ever to the external environment. During COVID-19, the strength of our model has never been clearer from our ability to deliver a threefold increase in global respirator production this year to the reconfiguration of our supply chain that enabled us to import more than 200 million respirators into the U.S. from Asia Pacific. In a matter of weeks, we also fully scaled up 2 new respirator lines at a plant in Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin, a process that would normally take several months. Those lines are now operating at rates 30% above similar lines as we've incorporated significant new technologies and analytic platforms and we continue to further optimize production volumes. While we have made progress, more work remains to build a stronger and more agile enterprise. Moving forward we will continue to optimize our new model, digitize our operations and improve the customer experience. All of these actions combined with relentless focus on operational execution will enable us to deliver greater value for our customers, shareholders and all stakeholders as economies recover from the impact of COVID-19. That wraps up my opening comments and I'll turn it over to Monish to cover the details of the quarter and our perspective on Q4. Monish?\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a good morning. Please turn to slide 7. Company-wide third quarter sales were $8.4 billion, up 4.5% year-on-year with adjusted operating income of $1.9 billion in line with last year. Third quarter adjusted operating margins were 22.9% versus 23.8% last year. As the company disclosed and you may recall, we recorded a $58 million gain from the sale of real estate in Q3 last year. This gain produced a 70 basis point headwind year-on-year to adjust operating margins. Turning to this year's third quarter. Our ongoing cost management and productivity efforts were more than offset by impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. This resulted in a net 50 basis point reduction to margins versus last year. Acquisitions and divestitures lowered margins by 20 basis points year-on-year, which includes a negative 50 basis point headwind from the Acelity acquisition due to purchase accounting impacts. Operationally, Acelity delivered a solid third quarter as health care elective procedures picked up sequentially. Based on Acelity's first year performance and integration progress, we are confident in the long-term success of this business. Please note that Acelity will now be reported as part of our organic results starting in Q4. Higher selling prices combined with lower raw material costs contributed 80 basis points to third quarter margins. And finally, foreign currency net of hedging impacts decreased margins by 30 basis points. Let's now turn to slide 8 for a closer look at earnings per share. Third quarter adjusted earnings were $2.43 per share versus $2.58 per share last year. The $0.15 year-on-year earnings decline is primarily due to 2 items: first as discussed on the prior slide, the Q3 2019 $58 million real estate gain resulted in an $0.08 per share earnings headwind year-on-year; and second, our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 21.4% versus 19% last year, resulting in an $0.08 year-on-year headwind to earnings per share. This headwind is primarily a function of last year's tax rate. Finally, acquisitions and divestitures contributed $0.01 to earnings. Please turn to slide nine for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. We delivered another quarter of robust free cash flow, with third quarter adjusted free cash flow of $2.2 billion, up 13% year-over-year. The third quarter cash flow performance was driven by a significant improvement in working capital, which contributed over $330 million of cash. Of note, we delivered an underlying decline in inventory of $240 million since the end of Q2. This reduction was largely driven by the 16% sequential improvement in sales, along with our continued work to improve inventory velocity. Looking ahead, we will continue to adjust our manufacturing production and inventory levels to meet changing customer demand trends, as the impact of the pandemic on the economy evolves. While the working capital progress is encouraging, the team continues to work on improving operating rigor through daily management to drive sustainable long-lasting improvement. Year-to-date, we have generated adjusted free cash flow of $4.6 billion, up 19% versus last year. Third quarter capital expenditures were $368 million and nearly $1.1 billion year-to-date. For the full year, we now anticipate CapEx in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion versus approximately $1.4 billion previously. During the third quarter, we returned $847 million to our shareholders via dividends. Share repurchases remained suspended throughout the quarter, given the continued global economic uncertainty. Our strong third quarter cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to strengthen our capital structure. We ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand and reduced net debt by $1.3 billion or 8% sequentially. Year-to-date, we have improved our net debt position by $2.8 billion or 16% since the start of the year. Looking ahead, our priorities remain unchanged, as we continue to focus on driving strong cash flow performance, maintaining disciplined capital allocation, while continuing to strengthen our financial flexibility to invest in our business and to return cash to our shareholders. Please turn to slide 10, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q3. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted organic growth of 6.9% year-on-year in the third quarter. Personal safety posted double-digit organic growth year-on-year, as we continue to experience unprecedented levels of demand for respirators globally in response to the pandemic. Automotive aftermarket improved sequentially and was up 1% year-on-year, as auto body shops reopened after the economic shutdowns in Q2. The strong growth in the residential housing market continued to drive good performance in our Roofing Granules business, which was up low teens organically versus Q3 of last year. The balance of the safety and industrial portfolio, namely abrasives, closure and masking systems, adhesives and tapes and electrical markets improved sequentially, but remained down year-over-year organically, as customers and channel partners remain cautious given the continued macroeconomics uncertainty. Looking geographically, the Americas grew 11% organically with the U.S. up low teens. EMEA also grew 8%, while Asia Pacific was down low single digits. Safety and industrial's third quarter segment operating margins were 27.2%, up 430 basis points driven by sales growth, continued strong productivity and spending discipline. Moving to Transportation and Electronics. Third quarter sales were down 7.1% organically compared to last year. Our electronics-related business was up 1%, with continued strong growth in semiconductor, factory automation and data centers, which was partially offset by year-on-year weakness in consumer electronics, particularly in smartphones. Our auto OEM business was down 4% year-on-year compared to the 3% decline in global car and light truck builds. Year-to-date, our automotive business has outperformed global builds by approximately 400 basis points. Beyond automotive builds, the pandemic also continues to have negative impacts on end markets such as hospitality, oil and gas, advertising and highway infrastructure due to social distancing and work-from-home protocols. These soft end market trends, resulted in year-on-year organic sales declines in our commercial solutions, transportation safety and advanced material businesses. Geographically, Asia Pacific declined 3% and while the Americas declined 11% and EMEA was down 16%. Transportation and Electronics third quarter operating margins were 23.9%, negatively impacted by the 7% decline in organic sales which was partially offset by continued cost discipline. Turning to Healthcare. Both organic growth and operating margins in this business improved from Q2 levels, as elective health care and oral care procedure volumes improved after experiencing significant pandemic-related challenges and disruptions across the industry in the second quarter. Overall, our Healthcare business delivered Q3 organic sales growth of 8.1% year-on-year with operating margins of 23.5%. Medical Solutions grew mid-teens, including the impact from continued strong pandemic-related demand for disposable respirators to protect frontline healthcare workers. Excluding the respiratory impact, this business declined low single-digits as elective procedures remain significantly below 2019 levels. Our oral care business returned to positive growth in Q3 up low single-digits organically driven by the reopening of dental offices globally and the rebuild of channel inventories. Looking ahead, while we have seen improvement in both medical and dental procedures, currently procedures are leveling off and are forecasted to remain below pre-COVID levels through the end of 2021. Our separation and purification business increased low-teens year-on-year. This business continues to experience strong demand for biopharma filtration solutions in support of the pharmaceuticals industries' research and manufacturing efforts to develop vaccines and therapeutic treatments for COVID. Turning to health information systems. This business declined mid single-digits organically in the quarter as hospitals remain cautious relative to the information technology investments. And finally, food safety declined low single-digits as the pandemic and related prevention protocols continue to negatively impact the food services industry. Looking geographically, the Americas grew 13% EMEA also grew 9%, while Asia Pacific declined 4%. As I mentioned Healthcare's third quarter operating margins were 23.5% down 320 basis points year-on-year. Margins were negatively impacted by the Acelity acquisition and investments in productivity and growth, which were partially offset by the ongoing cost discipline. Looking sequentially, operating margins improved 670 basis points with 60% sequential leverage on 18% growth in sales. Lastly, second quarter organic growth for our Consumer Business was up 5.5%. Organic sales growth within Consumer continued to be led by our home improvement and home care businesses each up low double-digits organically. Growth in these businesses was driven by strong customer demand for our Filtrete air filtration products ScotchBlue Painter's Tapes, Command Wall Hanging products, Meguiar's car care products and Scotch-Brite cleaning products and solutions. Stationery and office declined double-digits as a result of many business offices and schools remaining partially or fully closed due to the pandemic. Looking at Consumer geographically, the Americas led up 7% organically; and EMEA grew 5%, while Asia Pacific declined 1%. Consumer's operating margins were 25.3% up 200 basis points on strong organic sales growth and cost discipline. Looking ahead, we expect to continue to step-up investments in advertising and merchandising and new product innovation to address changing consumer demand trends. That wraps up my review of our third quarter business performance. In summary, we continue to execute well in a highly fluid and uncertain macro environment. We returned to positive organic sales growth, delivered solid operating margins of nearly 23%, increased adjusted free cash by 13%, reduced net debt by 8%, while also investing in both growth and productivity. Please turn to slide 11 and I will discuss our thoughts on Q4. As we enter the fourth quarter, significant economic and end market uncertainty continues to persist, as both global GDP and IPI are currently forecasted to remain negative year-on-year. Therefore, we remain cautious as the impacts of the pandemic on the global economy and end markets continues to evolve. From an end market perspective, we do expect continued strength in certain end markets. Namely personal safety, home improvement, general cleaning, semiconductor, data centers and biopharma filtration. At the same time year-on-year declines across many end markets, such as health care and oral care elective procedures, automotive OEM, general industrial, consumer electronics, hospitality and the office supplies are expected to persist through the balance of this year. In fact, many of these end markets are not expected to recover to pre-COVID levels until well into 2021 or beyond. Turning to our business. We currently estimate October total company sales growth to be flat to up low single-digits, which incorporates the anticipated impact of one fewer business day year-on-year. Please note, relative to business days that there is no year-on-year impact for the fourth quarter. However, on a sequential basis, we will have two fewer business days in Q4 as compared to Q3 this year. As we have done over the past several months, we will provide a monthly sales information through the end of the year due to the continued global macroeconomic uncertainty. Therefore, we will report October sales once we have finalized those results in a few weeks. Regarding disposable respirators, we expect continued strong demand, which we anticipate will contribute approximately 300 basis points to company-wide Q4 total sales growth. And as a reminder, we will have a negative fourth quarter sales impact year-on-year of approximately $100 million 130 basis points from our May 2020 divestiture of drug delivery. From an operational standpoint, we will maintain a strong focus on cost management, while continuing to invest in both growth and productivity. With this in mind, we expect our fourth quarter adjusted operating margins of approximately 21%. Finally, we remain focused on generating strong cash flow, disciplined capital allocation and strengthening our balance sheet and financial flexibility. To wrap up, I would like to thank all 3Mers for the hard work this quarter and the progress that we have made. In the spirit of continuous improvement, there's always more we can do. Our team remains focused on fighting the pandemic from all angles, relentlessly serving our customers, delivering growth in revenue, margin and cash, strengthening our balance sheet and driving operating rigor through daily management. With that, I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nMike Roman: Hi, Dean.\nDeane Dray: Just with respect to the precision that you can provide and have been providing on the contribution from respirators, is it possible to give a \u2013 take a stab at a net COVID impact across 3M, or maybe the size like the key positives and key negatives? And positives, I would imagine are other PPE and the home improvement trends and so forth. But if you could net \u2013 size the biggest outliers on both sides of that equation and how you think that nets out as you see it today? \nMike Roman: Yes. And Dean, I would start with our entire business portfolio has been impacted one way or another from COVID-19. We talked about respirators, about 300 basis points of growth impact on the enterprise from that demand that we're seeing in respirators. But half of our businesses do remain down year-on-year. So we highlighted a couple of others that are up. You hit them as well. Our home improvement business, our separation, purification, our biopharma filtration business. Those are both up low teens. You look at some of the ones that have been impacted negatively, our office markets I would say in our hospitality kind of the commercial solutions those are both down low teens. So, it kind of gives you a view of how the impact plays out on both sides of that, both the positive demand and some of the impacts negatively from COVID.\nMonish Patolawala: I would just add Dean I think the other piece is we've also hit on elective procedures. So they are also down year-over-year. So that impacts our health care business. And then on the positive side too, the other piece I would throw out is, as the economy moves to a digital-first, thinking about how we play in our semiconductor space, data centers, factory automation is another area of strength that has helped us and through COVID.\nDeane Dray: Got that. And then, as a follow-up, when I looked at the guidance that you had given or the framework for the third quarter and you came in pretty darn close to -- and actually above on revenues and above on margins. What might be the prospects for restoring guidance? I know you've given our framework for 4Q. But just if you -- in the position, we are pretty darn close at this stage, when might guidance be restored? And when might you restore buybacks? I mean, you commented on disciplined capital allocation, but you had really good cash flow. You paid down debt when might buybacks be restored? Thanks.\nMike Roman: Yes. Deane, maybe I'll take the first part of that and just talk about how we think about guidance. And as we went through Q3 and got halfway through September, we did give you an estimate of how we were seeing sales. Behind that still, a lot of uncertainty about, how this is going to play out, how the economy is going to impact the businesses we were just talking about. And that remains true today. There's -- the current environment, it remains uncertain. So we continue to keep our guidance withdrawn. We're going to focus on executing well against what we see coming and we'll continue to report monthly sales. As soon as we get better visibility of the market outlook and the trends, then we will look at bringing back a view of guidance. But for now, we'll stay with the monthly sales reports.\nMonish Patolawala: And as I go to capital allocation Deane, just our priorities haven't changed. We've -- what we've always said is our first priority is investing organically because that's where we believe we get the best return. Our second priority has been paying dividends. Dividends has been a hallmark of 3M and I know our investors care about it. So that's our second priority. And then our third priority is M&A. And then with that is share buyback. So that's the way we look at our four. As you know through the pandemic and through the uncertainty that's going on, we have strengthened the financial position as you saw by reducing net debt. We also suspended share buyback at the end of first quarter. And right now, as we have announced our share buyback remains withdrawn. We are working on 2021. We have multiple scenarios. And as we finalize that, we'll keep you updated as appropriate.\nDeane Dray: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Hi, good morning guys.\nMonish Patolawala: Hey Scott.\nMike Roman: Hi Scott.\nScott Davis: Are you guys surprised at all that Health Care margins weren't a little bit better, just given the 8% growth, the operating leverage that you would typically get from that?\nMonish Patolawala: No. I think -- I would say Scott, we are pretty much online. The team has done a nice job of controlling costs. As you can see sequentially, our margin rates have gone up 670 basis points. And that's driven a lot by the fact that the team has done a nice job as well as the volumes have picked up, you get the operating leverage and that's what we've seen, so nothing untoward. The thing that you also have to keep in mind on a year-over-year basis, as we bought Acelity and the impact of the purchase accounting nearly causes a 220 basis point drag on a year-over-year basis due to purchase accounting.\nScott Davis: Yes. I saw that. So -- okay. I'll move on. The price in the quarter that you quoted in the earlier slide, I think 60 basis points I believe. That's a pretty good number in a recession, particularly given that raw material costs are low, so it's not pushing up price. Is that -- is there any way to kind of tease that out? Is that new product? And so therefore, it's kind of partially price mix? Is it just the fact that there's certain products you have that are in really high demand right now and so you're getting price in that area? Just maybe some high-level commentary there would be helpful.\nMonish Patolawala: Sure, Scott. Price was 60 basis points and I agree with you, the team has done a good job of driving it. But as you know that's the innovation model. The company has historically managed to get 30 to 50 basis points and part of it is just the strength of the innovation and the customer value we add. On the price over 60, I would say the Americas and the EMEA were both that we saw price increase. Asia Pacific was down on year-over-year. And I would say there's nothing I would call out as specific or one product line that drove it. It's a general increase that we have seen across multiple markets and the products that we have introduced this year as well as the pricing actions that were put into place at the beginning of the year and they are holding.\nScott Davis: Okay. Helpful. Good luck guys. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you.\nMike Roman: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning.\nMike Roman: Hey Nigel.\nMonish Patolawala: Hi Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Yes, hi. I'm just kind of curious on the sequential trends and obviously you've given some decent information on what you've seen in October. But it does seem like on a daily sales basis September was a bit weaker than what you saw in July August. And maybe October got a little bit better than September. I mean again I don't want to sort of play the interest here, but can you just make comments number one if that's kind of correct on a daily sales basis? And then secondly, what you're seeing in terms of channels by business if possible. And kind of did we see a big restock through the summer that perhaps has now played through? Any information on that would be great. \nMike Roman: Yes, Nigel maybe I'll start with the second part of that. Just looking at the channel we haven't seen strong restocking across most of our portfolio. Maybe some in Health Care as elective procedures have come back. And I would say otherwise the channel has been cautious and we haven't seen a strong restocking as we went through third quarter even as we come into October. So, if you think about how sales trended as we went through Q3, we came in a bit better than the range that we said the $8.2 billion to $8.3 billion. Overall, revenues were pretty consistent through the quarter, two months we had sales we were up about 4%. For the full quarter we grew about 4.5%. Normally -- and I would say pre-COVID, we would see a strong upward trend as we go through September and as the quarter progresses. In both Q2 and Q3 that trend is there, but not at the historical level. So, looking through that and then what Monish mentioned about October that through the early part of October, we're seeing flat to low single-digits, the sales trends have been pretty steady through the interim quarter of Q3 into the start of Q4. \nNigel Coe: Okay. That's great. Well, I'll follow up offline with Bruce on that. And then my follow-up question is on inventories. You've taken down inventories a fair bit into -- from 2Q to 3Q, I think down roughly $200 million implies that your production volumes were down probably low single-digits year-over-year. So, I'm curious if that had an impact on fixed cost absorption because the margins were pretty impressive. So, I'm just wondering if there was a drag from that inventory reduction. And then do you expect to continue reducing inventories into 4Q and probably 2021?\nMonish Patolawala: Sure. I'll just start with the first one. So, the team's done a nice job on inventory reduction. As I said earlier, I would say there are two pieces that drove it. One is you saw the volumes quarter-over-quarter sequentially up nearly 16%. I would say that's just number one that drove it. And secondly the team has been focused and is focused on driving inventory velocity up. And those are the two factors. For example they started doing -- using a lot of data and analytics that helps us decide where our inventory level should be. There's always more work to do there, but that's another driver of how we were able to drive this down. I would say to your second question on do you see it going down or not, I think our philosophy hasn't changed on making sure that our inventory levels keep going down and our velocity keeps going up. But it's an extremely uncertain environment. So, you're seeing markets that are up a lot. You're seeing product lines that are down a lot. Mike already touched about some of the lines where we were down double-digits and some other lines where we were way up double-digits. So, I think that's what we are working on balancing. So, we'll decide as the pandemic settles out what our production level should be what our inventory level should be. But overall, I would count on you -- count on us to make sure that our inventory levels from a velocity perspective keep improving. And then your last question on manufacturing unabsorbed cost. So, as you know some lines were up or down. We have incurred costs which is approximately $35 million of fixed cost that are unabsorbed manufacturing variances.\nNigel Coe: I think I've got five questions. So, I'll leave it there. Thank you very much.\nMonish Patolawala: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning guys.\nMike Roman: Hey Andy.\nMonish Patolawala: Hey Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Monish maybe you can give us a little more color into your adjusted operating margin guidance the 21% for Q4. You obviously recorded a much higher margin than that in Q3. Incrementals were good sequentially above 40%. Obviously, we know two fewer selling days so lower sales. But is there any other margin impacts on the business in Q4 versus Q3 mix or maybe you expect temporary costs to come back faster in Q4?\nMonish Patolawala: So, I would say Andy, there are quite a few factors that go into it so I'll just start again with just with the uncertainty that's in the market and volume is a big driver of it. We are seeing GDP and IPI both are going to be down year-over-year or projected to be down. We have also seen uncertainty in the market. In general, we are seeing places where for example where I said healthcare procedures are leveling customers are remaining cautious et cetera. So, there's a lot of uncertainty in that market. On the flip side, we continue to see pretty good end market trends whether it is on our personal safety, our home cleanliness, and our home improvement business, and then biopharma filtration. So, when you put all that together the team will continue to monitor that as the economy evolves. We are continuing to focus on making sure that we have cost -- we are being very cautious on cost. But at the same time we will invest in growth and productivity where required. So, you're going to see both sides here. You saw us talking about investing in some of these segments that we see that in the longer run we have growth potential. So, with all that put together, as well as just remember, sequentially historically two \u2013 Q3 versus Q4 we always see a drop in margins. Q4 is the lowest for 3M, and part of that is driven by just the two lower billing days that you get on a year-over-year basis. So the fixed cost gets spread over a shorter number of days. So with all that put together, we believe right now the line of sight we have is to 21%.\nAndy Kaplowitz: That's helpful, Monish. And then maybe just a follow-up on that. Can you give us more color into the margin performance in Safety and Industrial and Consumer? The margins you recorded in Q3 in both those segments, we really haven't seen those kind of margins from 3M in those segments. So maybe the sustainability, if temporary costs come back how much of the sort of tailwind that you're seeing is from some of the long-term things you've been doing like transformation factory optimization? I think you mentioned advertising, maybe you're doing less advertising consumer but do you see these types of margins being sustainable as you go forward in these two segments and as you go into 2021?\nMonish Patolawala: Sure. I'll start with just giving you the reasons for the strong growth, and then I'll talk about what we think about the future. On the growth in SIBG, the margins were driven by two pieces. One is extremely strong demand for our respirator business. So that's one as well as our sequential improvement pretty much across all the industrial product lines have helped us from an overall cost position. And secondly, the team has done a great job of being very cautious on how much \u2013 on being cautious about the spending levels, and I think both of that. But at the same time, the industrial business the Safety and Industrial has continued to invest also where we see the growth opportunities. And then on the consumer side, it's driven again by strong growth in our home care business and our home improvement business, which has also helped us from a margin rate perspective. The point on advertising and merchandising that I was bringing on is the team has spent what they think is appropriate in this environment. But as we are starting to see markets come back up and seeing some of the future trends in this area, we are going to continue to invest in advertising and merchandising, as well as investing in new product innovation as required. But I think, I would say that in general is the philosophy that we're going to follow, which is we're going to invest in growth and productivity in areas that we feel that has long-term potential for 3M. At the same time, we'll dial back in areas or reprioritize in areas that we feel in the short run may not give us the big bang for the buck. So that's the way we would think about it. \nAndy Kaplowitz: Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning.\nMike Roman: Hi, John.\nMonish Patolawala: Hi, John.\nJohn Walsh: So wanted to go back to kind of the capital allocation strategy. If we take where you ended this quarter after some delevering actions just \u2013 I'll use consensus numbers here but you take what you're forecasted for free cash flow less the dividend. You look at the EBITDA projections, I mean, there's a path here for you to end next year below 1.5 turns of net leverage. Is that where you're trying to get to? Would you push back on any of that? I just wanted to get your thoughts on where you actually want to get the net leverage down to?\nMonish Patolawala: Sure, John. As Nick and Mike had said before my time too, the company wanted to get below sub-two on a net debt-to-EBITDA leverage and we are right now where we are. So we are at 1.8 at the end of Q3. The way I look at it is again, it's an extremely uncertain environment right now. So we don't have any target that we're going other than we want to keep strengthening the balance sheet keep giving us the financial flexibility and that's what we are doing. As we get into 2021, we'll see how the world looks like from that trend. And at that point, we'll make a decision. But you should just count on 3M to have a strong balance sheet and that's what we're going towards.\nJohn Walsh: Got you. Thank you for that. And then just thinking about some of the uses of that potentially any update here around environmental thinking about an EPA action plan and/or anything on the calendar just for investors to be aware as we think about what 2021 looks like? I think you provided an update last quarter, was just curious if anything changed?\nMike Roman: Yeah, John maybe I'll start where we always start. We're proactively managing that really EHS and PFAS kinds of strategies. And we do that around sound science, corporate responsibility and transparency. So, trying to keep you updated as we go here. And your question about EPA, we've been supportive of the EPA's plan for managing PFAS and we've been working in support of them with our commitments to provide a clearing house of information around that. When you look at \u2013 how do we look at 2020 and 2021? I would say, we continue to work as 3M around our manufacturing sites around historical disposal. And we continue to make progress on that. When you look at potential other actions and other EHS matters, I would say, there's been a slowdown with some litigation actions as part of that in the middle of COVID. So now we're looking at trials and related matters next year, first half of next year. So whether it's bellwether trials in Michigan or the multi-district litigation actions those are coming now sometime early to the first half of next year. So nothing more. We -- the reserves that we've taken for the work that we've been doing on our manufacturing sites, those are -- those cover what we see as probable and less mobile today. So that gives you kind of an updated outlook into early next year. \nJohn Walsh: Great. Appreciate all the color. Thank you.\nMike Roman: Thanks John.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you and good morning.\nMike Roman: Good morning Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Nice sequential improvement on Health Care but sort of longer-term question. This used to be 28% 30% margin business. Or another way to ask is in 2017, 2018 you could make around $500 billion with $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion of revenue and now sort of takes $2.2 billion of revenue to make that. Can you just bridge the gap where we were and where we are now. And I get that Acelity is 200 basis points plus. But what are the other big buckets that sort of drive this decline in margin? And what would it take for it to come back? \nBruce Jermeland: Yes Andrew, this is Bruce. If you look at the EBITDA margins of Health Care they're right at 30% here in the quarter. So the big driver of -- there's two items really that impact margins as you look at it historically. The realignment of the company when we move the Separation Purification business into Health Care had below-average Health Care margins. So that had a negative impact. And then secondly, the D&A associated with the Acelity acquisition is impacting the margins. So peeling that back though Health Care right now is right around 30%. So kind of back to the upper 20s to around 30% range. \nAndrew Obin: Got you. And then the second question is on elective procedures you sort of did -- I think you sort of indicated a slowdown in September October. Can you just comment as to what explicitly you guys are seeing on elective procedures? And are you seeing a slowdown related to the second wave of COVID? And how is the second way of COVID factoring your forecast for Health Care and across the board for the company? \nMike Roman: Yes. Andrew just if you look at Q3 we saw an increase in elective procedures coming into Q3. We saw that coming out of Q2 starting and then coming into Q3. That was behind some of the improvements that you saw sequentially in the Health Care business broadly. We -- as Monish mentioned in his remarks, we've seen a flattening of elective procedures not necessarily a downturn or -- but a slowdown in a flattening as we've exited September and come into October. So back to it's -- what's driving it. There's a lot of uncertainty of will it pick back up will it stay flat. I would say, we are continuing to remain cautious there as well. \nMonish Patolawala: And that -- sorry go ahead. \nAndrew Obin: So are you effectively modeling no acceleration -- no sequential acceleration in elective procedures due to COVID? Is that just part of the framework? \nMonish Patolawala: So I'll just first answer a little more on with numbers. So if the U.S. and Europe with the data that we see Andrew was at the end of third quarter between the 70% to 75% of pre-COVID levels in those two parts of the world. China of course was a little higher in between the 85% to 90%. And as we said I think what we are seeing is a flattening. I think there's nervousness right now with some of -- with what's going on in the world of course with the outbreaks of COVID in a few of the regions. And we have multiple scenarios that we are watching. And as I mentioned we believe elective procedures will be down on a year-over-year basis. And you can pick that range but we believe it's going to be -- right now what we are seeing is pretty much flat October to September. \nAndrew Obin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. \nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning everybody.\nMonish Patolawala: Hi Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: So my first question is maybe just focused on the actions that you had announced previously. I think you had announced something like $400 million or so in cost actions in the second quarter. And I know a lot of those actions were expected to be temporary. I'm just curious how did those play out into 3Q? And is there still any kind of carryover benefit from those cost actions that we should expect into 4Q? \nMonish Patolawala: Sure Joe. I'll answer both separately. On the $400 million as announced and as you correctly stated most of them were temporary in nature. And some of them as we had also disclosed at the end of Q2 have a reversal impact in Q3 and Q4 especially vacation accruals become negative in Q3 and Q4, as well as the timing of our bonus accruals, AIP accruals become negative quarter-over-quarter. The overall impact of all that put together was a $50 million benefit in Q3. And then your second question on what do I see it going forward? I would say also if you recall in the second quarter we had announced some actions that we had from a restructuring perspective, but that would have an impact in 2021 and beyond. And then in the fourth quarter of 2019 also we had announced actions that we had taken as we went into the new model of the new transform way of running 3M, and there's approximately $30 million of benefit in that in the second half.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. All right. That's helpful, Monish. And then, just my one follow-on question. I know it's probably too early to start thinking about 2021. But, you do have this phenomena this year where your respirator sales are helping to boost growth in 2020, and looks like we're going to be in this pandemic-related situation for quite some time. I guess, I'm just trying to understand how you guys are thinking about framing what the either tailwind or headwind could potentially be in 2021 from just the respirator portion of your business?\nMonish Patolawala: Yeah. The way we look at it, Joe, is that we believe respiratory production continues or that demand continues for a long time. So, we continue to see, I would say, the strength from that business to grow. We are investing in capacity as we have announced. We have made around -- we'll make around two billion respirators this year. We'll exit at a run rate of 1.2 billion for the second half, which is nearly 2.4 million to 2.5 billion respirators for 2021. And so, our view is that demand remains strong. As well as, we are truly committed to fighting the pandemic from all angles, and this is just one piece of it. Between this, the home cleanliness products, the home filtration products, 3M is doing everything we can to help the world out and make it safer.\nJoe Ritchie: Thank you. I\u2019ll get back in queue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Julian.\nMonish Patolawala: Hi.\nJulian Mitchell: This maybe just -- good morning. Maybe just hopefully for you, at least one last question on healthcare margins. So, just one that I suppose maybe looking ahead, what do you think the run rate margin level is, what sort of operating leverage should we expect in that segment? Because, I understand the separation and purification, going into the segment, I understand the Acelity impact. But you look year-on-year Q3 the margin ex-Acelity is still down 100 bps of high single-digit organic growth. And I understand, sequentially the margin was up in Q3. But I'm guessing it's probably down sequentially in Q4. So just trying to take a step back from all of that looking forward, what do you think the operating leverage is in healthcare? And do you think there are kind of outsized reinvestment needs there?\nMonish Patolawala: So, I'll answer my question Julian, with a caveat that I'm 90 days in. But I'd start with the following that the team has done a nice job. You saw the margins rebound from Q2 to Q3 as the sequentials came through. I think for Q4, which is what we should be looking at the question that will come around is what's the volumes going to be, based on where we are with everything that we're seeing in electives and oral care. And I think that's the big piece. The team will continue to focus on making sure that we are being very cautious on what we spend on cost. But at the same time, as we start seeing the future growth come back post the pandemic, we will not hesitate to invest in growth and productivity, because this is a great franchise for us and we want to keep making sure that it has long-term growth and good margin performance too.\nJulian Mitchell: I see. And then maybe Monish, circling back on that cost question that Joe had touched on. If we look at say 2021, in aggregate with everything that we know today, you've got some fixed costs, I suppose, carryover savings from the Q2 actions. Maybe help us understand what that is in totality in terms of the year-on-year tailwind next year? And also, do you see any headwind next year as you sit today from temporary costs coming back, or those all came back in the second half of this year already?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So I would say, Julian, we are busy working on building out 2021. So I'll give you definitely more detail as we get into 2021. And but as I mentioned just a few sets of numbers for you, is the action that we took in Q2 of 2020, has a tailwind of nearly $110 million in 2021, because that's the restructuring action that we'll take. The flip side of that is, as you know we have got a lot of temporary measures put into place. We have frozen contractor services, travel, et cetera, and some of that will come back on a year-over-year basis. As well as depending on what the future growth potential is, we will be investing growth and productivity at the same time. So long answer to your question that there are multiple moving pieces. We are in the midst of working through 2021, and we'll definitely keep you appraise of that as soon as we lock down on our case.\nBruce Jermeland: Yeah, Julian, just let me clarify the actions we took, the $110 million related to our Q4 action we announced.\nMonish Patolawala: Yeah, yeah. My fault.\nBruce Jermeland: The Q2 action we announced is relatively small.\nMonish Patolawala: Yeah. My apologies. That's right.\nJulian Mitchell: Perfect. Great. Thanks, Monish and Bruce.\nBruce Jermeland: Yeah. Thank you.\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning guys.\nMike Roman: Hey, Josh.\nMonish Patolawala: Hi, Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: So just to move a little bit off the current quarter. And Mike you touched on it a little bit in your opening remarks, but I just want to dig in a little bit more. This lateral antigen test that you were putting together with MIT, if I'm reading this right I think some of your peers are out there making one billion of these things a year on a run rate basis. And I would suspect that 3M probably making it cheaper as more of a professional manufacturer than some of these other folks and given the mediums you're working with. How big could this be? Is this something that's any closer to deployment? Because I think going hand-in-hand with needing masks for a while is we're probably going to need tests for a while too.\nMike Roman: Yes. Josh, let me give you maybe an update here. So this is the testing work that we're doing with MIT as a partner sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. And this has been a focus on a low-cost highly accurate paper-based device that can be mass manufactured. So, large numbers like you're talking about. And so where we're at we've created a prototype of that. And it's -- this is a saliva-based test and we've demonstrated sensitivity in the lab. And we're currently in a phase where it's being validated by an outside laboratory, and this includes a number of -- a series of tests including test against live samples positives, negatives really to determine how good it is at detecting COVID-19 and accurately. And so if that goes well then we would be looking at ramping it up to production. We would be -- the next step would be to work with the FDA on an Emergency Use Authorization probably sometime in the first half of next year just to give you a little bit of the time line. But it is something that would be a volume based low cost test that could be used broadly. So, we're excited about the partnership. We're excited about the good progress to this point but more work to be done.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. And just on understanding the numbers right, maybe that run rate production number that I threw out sounds like it's not too far off. But price per test, I think those peers are $5 to $10 a test. Is this sounds like you'd be on the lower end of that maybe a little bit lower, but the easy algebra there it comes over the pretty big revenue number if all that comes together. Is that that fair, but still just too early to commit to a total TAM?\nMike Roman: Yes. Josh, we still have some work to do. So I'll stay with low cost for now and we'll come back as we make more progress.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. Perfect. And I thanks for the time and I appreciate the color. So I\u2019ll leave it there.\nMike Roman: Okay, Josh.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Tusa: Hi guys. Good morning.\nMike Roman: Hi, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Just wanted to confirm. So October kind of if you adjust to days sales like up five or something like that. Is that kind of the right number adjusted for days?\nMike Roman: Well, as we -- Steve, we said, it's low -- flat to low single-digits October trend. That takes into account that extra day. So, trending a little bit above that net of the extra day. \nSteve Tusa: Okay. Got it. Got it.\nMike Roman: Yes.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. Sorry I might have missed that. And then just kind of like headed into next year on the top line. And any kind of major -- sorry on the bottom line any kind of puts and takes that we have to be aware of when it comes to pension or anything like that that's just more mechanical when thinking about next year?\nMonish Patolawala: Nothing that I can think of right now Steve. Again, as we get through 2021, as we finish our planning for 2021 we'll definitely keep you posted, but as of right now nothing mechanical.\nBruce Jermeland: Yes. On pension, Steve, obviously, we'll see where rates are at on December 31 and that will determine what the expense is next year.\nSteve Tusa: Where would that -- if you snap the line today where would that be?\nBruce Jermeland: No, we're not providing that at this point, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot guys.\nBruce Jermeland: Yeah.\nOperator: Our question comes from the line of John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Inch: Yes. Thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in. Good morning everybody.\nMike Roman: Hey, John.\nMonish Patolawala: Hi, John.\nJohn Inch: Hi. Good morning guys. By the way I see on Page 11 you're really bullish on general cleaning. So can I ask you what were the third quarter 2020 margin benefits of past restructuring actions if we could just perhaps start there? \nBruce Jermeland: Yeah. If you look at third quarter John, it's pretty minimal, because we've lapped now the Q2 actions we took a year ago. And in the Q4 actions that we announced earlier this year, they were somewhat impacted by COVID. And so we put in place for example things like hiring freezes as we've gone through COVID. So those actions are going to have more of an impact next year as Monish mentioned $110 million to $120 million, a little impact here in the second half of this year. \nJohn Inch: Okay, Bruce. So then, I mean to get to 21% margins for the fourth quarter, if you look a year ago when you add back the restructuring costs you get kind of almost 21%. So you're sort of assuming kind of flat pro forma margins. I was just wondering if you expected contribution from any kind of cost-out tailwinds or other things. Just trying to get back to the -- like to gauge how conservative you're being in terms of your fourth quarter guide of 21%?\nBruce Jermeland: Yes, there is some benefit from the actions we took. But as Monish mentioned earlier John, some of the actions that we put in place in Q2 such as we encourage our employees to take half of their vacation by the middle of the year becomes a headwind in Q4 because people generally take a fair amount of vacation during the holiday. So, plus we're continuing to making sure we're investing in the business to set up success as we go into 2021. So for now 21% is where we think is appropriate as we start the quarter. \nJohn Inch: Okay. And then just secondly, where do you expect COVID sales to be in the fourth quarter versus the $235 million in the third quarter? In other words sort of how much up sequentially? And is this sequential sales trend is it accelerating, or is it sort of decelerating as the bulk of -- just to try and put all of this into the context. I realize you threw out those numbers 1.4 to 2.45 next year. But what sort of -- what's happening to the curve sequentially in terms of the contribution if you can maybe isolate that? Thanks. \nMike Roman : Yes, John. So we -- as Monish mentioned, we've added capacity as we've come into the second half or brought it online capacity that we have been working on as we've gone through the year. So that will have a little bit of an impact. I think it's still in that 300 basis point range for Q4. It will be sequentially up slightly off of Q3. \nJohn Inch: Sequentially up slightly even though the fourth quarter is usually a bigger sales number though right? \nMike Roman : No. \nJohn Inch: I'm not quoting. And I'm just trying to understand the context. It seems like it's holding steady. \nMike Roman : Yes. Normally you see a sequential decline from Q3 to Q4. Really typically there's two days difference between Q3 and Q4. That's one of the drivers. It's -- there's the holidays have an impact. And so we -- in respirator because of the situation we're in, I would say it's going to be similar to what you saw in Q3 maybe a little bit up as we bring that additional capacity online and serve the demand out there. \nJohn Inch: And then Mike moving into 2021, do you see COVID sales sort of gently decelerating, or do you see more of a like a bit of a cliff phenom say hitting when they started to really ramp say in the second quarter or something like that? \nMike Roman : John, there's still a lot of uncertainty. I mean, we see demand extending into 2021 for sure and then we're bringing that capacity on to be ready for that. Well as Monish said, we're getting kind of our view of this as we get further into Q4 and get ready for 2021. We'll come back and give you a breakdown on that. \nJohn Inch: Good though. Thanks very much.\nBruce Jermeland: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your questions.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. It's Simon [ph] on the line for Laurence, which is a quick one. You mentioned Health Care elective demand has been weak because -- for obvious reasons. I was wondering if that has accelerated in the recent weeks just with all the headlines we're seeing with increasing COVID cases worldwide if things are getting worse in that particular sub-segment? \nMonish Patolawala : So we haven't seen it getting worse as of right now, Laurence. I would say we are seeing a flattening of the curve. But I'm sure as you go area-by-area depending on where local lockdowns are happening they'll have an impact. But we haven't seen that yet at our level. So we are seeing more a flattening. But this thing can change weekly depending on how it goes. So this is just an initial trend of what we're seeing right now. \nUnidentified Analyst : All right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments. \nMike Roman : All right. Thank you. To wrap up, our operational performance was strong in the third quarter as we executed well, innovated for our customers and continued to fight the pandemic from all angles.  In a highly uncertain economic environment, our team delivered robust cash flow strong margins and return to positive organic sales growth. Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in both growth and productivity and we remain confident in our ability to lead the economic recovery, deliver great value for our stakeholders and realize new opportunities from emerging market trends. Thank you for joining us. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."}, {"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 2, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-07-28 13:03:03", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M second quarter earnings conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question and answer session.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, July 28, 2020.  I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. \nBruce Jermeland: Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2020 business review. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, along with Nick Gangestad and Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial Officers. As you may know, Nick will be retiring at the end of July. Monish joined the 3M team on July 1, succeeding Nick as CFO. Mike, Nick and Monish will make some formal comments and then we\u2019ll take your questions.  Please note that today\u2019s earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading, Quarterly Earnings. Please turn to Slide 2. Let me remind you to mark your calendars for our third quarter earnings call, which will take place on Tuesday, October 27.  Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today\u2019s conference call, we\u2019ll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Finally, throughout today\u2019s presentation we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today\u2019s press release. Please note we have provided segment and total company adjusted EBITDA reconciliations for reference in today\u2019s press release attachments as part of our non-GAAP measures. Please turn to Slide 4, and I\u2019ll hand it off to Mike. Mike?\nMichael Roman: Thank you Bruce. Good morning everyone. I hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy, and I thank you for joining us. We continue to fight the pandemic from all angles to ensure the safety of our employees, healthcare workers, first responders, and the public. In a highly uncertain environment where economic activity was restricted by global lockdowns, we executed well and delivered another strong operational performance in the second quarter. We posted solid margins and robust cash flow while strengthening our balance sheet, innovating for our customers, investing in the future, and continuing our transformation. Our value model is strong and we are taking action on a number of fronts to lead through this crisis and emerge even stronger. While there remains a great deal of economic uncertainty, we are seeing an improvement in sales trends in July across all businesses and geographies as we start the third quarter, and Monish will provide additional comments later in the call. I am proud of how our team is leading through these unprecedented times and I thank all 3Mers for their tireless efforts to serve those who count on us. Please turn to Slide 5. Our COVID-19 response starts with a steadfast commitment to the health of our employees. We have robust safety protocols in our manufacturing plants and distribution sites, enabling us to effectively protect our people while maintaining supply chain operations. For remote employees, we have developed a phased approach for their return to the workplace with enhanced safety measures and emphasis on flexibility for individuals. We have had our colleagues return to the workplace in two dozen countries, mainly in Asia and EMEA, along with our global R&D community, and we are adjusting based on government guidelines and the evolution of the pandemic across the world.  As we protect employees, we work around the clock to protect the safety of all people, including healthcare workers and first responders. 3M is making and distributing more respirators than ever before, though demand continues to far outpace what the entire industry can supply. In the first half of the year, 3M manufactured 800 million respirators globally with half distributed in the U.S., primarily to healthcare and FEMA. For the full year, we expect to produce 2 billion respirators globally, more a threefold increase versus 2019.  We continue to make investments and partner with the U.S. Department of Defense and other governments to bring additional global capacity online. We are also working with federal, state and local governments to deliver respirators where the need is greatest. At the same time, we remain vigilant in fighting fraud and price gouging. To date, 3M has filed 18 lawsuits and removed over 7,000 counterfeit websites, protecting people from bad actors.  Beyond personal protective equipment, 3M science is fighting COVID-19 in other areas as well. Our membrane technologies help improve blood oxygenation procedures and our biopharma solutions support the development of needed vaccines and therapeutics. Earlier this month, we announced a collaboration with MIT on a diagnostic COVID-19 test that aspires to make testing faster, more broadly available, and less expensive. The project has received approval from the National Institutes of Health and we are working as fast as we can to develop a low cost, highly accurate device that can be mass produced. I will now turn to our second quarter results on Slide 6. The financial impact of the pandemic remained mixed across 3M during Q2. We continue to see strong demand in personal safety along with other areas, such as home improvement, general cleaning, and biopharma filtration. At the same time, we experienced steep but expected declines in other end markets, including medical and dental elective procedures, automotive OEM and aftermarket, and general industrial.  Geographically, while organic sales in Asia Pacific declined 8%, we saw year-over-year improvement in China, up 3% in the quarter versus down 11% in Q1. Organic trends in EMEA and the Americas remained consistent throughout the quarter, both declining in the mid-teens each month. All in, organic sales company-wide was minus 13% with adjusted earnings of $1.78 per share. While growth conditions were challenging, our operational execution was strong. We expanded adjusted EBITDA margins to 26.5%, up 110 basis points year-on-year. In the second quarter, we delivered $400 million in cost savings versus last year as we aggressively managed expenses to offset COVID-19 impacts and associated restructuring. This cost discipline along with effective capital allocation enabled us to increase our adjusted free cash flow to $1.5 billion in the second quarter, and Nick will walk you through the details. Please turn to Slide 7. Importantly, while we managed near term uncertainty, we continued to advance our four strategic priorities: portfolio, transformation, innovation, and people and culture to deliver value for our customers and shareholders. We finalized the sale of our drug delivery business in May, enabling us to focus more on our core healthcare portfolio. We are encouraged at the benefits we are seeing from the new global operating model we implemented this year, a significant step in our transformation. This includes our new enterprise operations team which is enabling us to reduce cycle times and improve the customer experience. Nearly all of our plants and distribution centers are operational and we have worked with our partners to ensure consistency of supply. Our new structure streamlines decision making and allows us to adjust faster than ever to the external environment, all of which helps our customers. As just one example, one of our U.S. plants recently pivoted to manufacturing hand sanitizer almost overnight, moving from formulation to production in less than 72 hours.  In addition, we\u2019re accelerating our efforts on automation and robotics and introducing new digital capabilities such as virtual selling tools to deliver on our promises to customers. At the heart of 3M is innovation and our ability to apply science to solve critical customer needs. We continue to invest in R&D and drive innovations to solve big challenges like air quality, automotive electrification and food safety, just a few of our priority growth platforms which are outperforming in the markets they serve. For example, our air quality platform grew double digits in the quarter as we introduce new indoor air quality solutions through our innovation and increased investments in capital.  We are also finding new ways to engage our people, strengthen our culture, and advance our core values. We continue to step up our leadership in sustainability and our annual Sustainability Report released in May includes a comprehensive look at our progress. As part of this commitment, we are proactively managing PFAS guided by the principles of sound science, corporate responsibility, and transparency. For example, in March we launched a clearinghouse to share research on testing, measurement and remediation, a commitment we made at our Congressional testimony last fall. You can find this clearinghouse and all the latest information on PFAS on our website at 3m.com. In addition, we provide regular updates in our 10-Q filings. We are also fulfilling our commitment to comprehensive reviews of all 3M manufacturing operations to ensure adherence to environmental requirements, company policies, and our values. As we shared previously, we continue to work with communities where we manufacture, along with government officials and regulators including the EPA, to advance our environmental stewardship.  Last week, we announced an agreement with the Alabama Department of Environmental Management to resolve matters related to previously disclosed PFAS discharges at our Decatur facility. This is part of our commitment to address contamination at sites where we manufactured or disposed of PFAS. With respect to PFAS litigation, we anticipate the earliest trial date will now be in 2021.  Beyond our environmental responsibility, we know we and others must do more to address injustice and inequality. The death of George Floyd here in Minnesota was jarring for all 3Mers, especially our African American employees. At 3M, we stand for equity, fairness and social justice, and we will be part of the solution by listening, understanding, and then acting. Based on insights from our employees and communities, we have two focus areas. First, we are identifying the most impactful actions to accelerate inclusion and diversity within 3M. While we have made good progress in recent years, we have much more to do. At the same time, we are working with other companies on actions that will make a difference here in Minnesota, and we have made initial investments as part of these efforts. We are also working with stakeholders to develop a long term plan to support economic opportunities and development in communities of color, address the education gap, and advance social justice. It is vital that companies step up to lead change, to really make a difference this time. I am personally leading these initiatives and we will provide you with updates as we move forward. Please turn to Slide 8. Before turning the call to Nick, I would like to make a few comments about our CFO transition. First, I want to thank Nick for his many contributions throughout 35 years at 3M. He has been an outstanding leader and a great colleague, and has created tremendous value for our company and our shareholders. In six years as CFO, Nick\u2019s guidance has been especially valuable as he helped lead our transformation and our work to optimize our portfolio and position 3M for the future. I wish Nick and his family all the best in the future. I am also excited to welcome Monish to our leadership team. Most recently, Monish was CFO at GE Healthcare, a $17 billion business. His experience leading healthcare and industrial businesses along with driving operational transformation is already making an immediate impact for 3M. Monish is an ideal fit for our enterprise and for our culture, and later in the call he will make a few comments about our perspective on the third quarter. I will now turn the call over to Nick for the details on Q2. Nick?\nNicholas Gangestad: Thank you Mike and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 9. Company-wide second quarter sales were $7.2 billion, with adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion and adjusted operating margins of 19.6%. On the right-hand side of this slide, you see the components of our margin performance in the second quarter. The impact of the pandemic was varied and numerous across the business and operations. The biggest factor negatively affecting Q2 operating margins was the impact of the pandemic on global customer demand, which resulted in nearly a 14% year-on-year decline in organic sales volumes.  In addition, during the quarter we undertook restructuring actions resulting in a Q2 charge of $58 million due to the impact of the pandemic. These headwinds were partially offset by aggressive cost management during the quarter which reduced costs by approximately $400 million year-on-year. Also providing a year-on-year benefit to operating margins is a restructuring charge in last year\u2019s second quarter. All in, these benefits were more than offset by the decline in organic sales volume and restructuring actions resulting in a 100 basis point reduction to second quarter margins versus last year. Acquisitions and divestitures reduced margins by 80 basis points due to Acelity purchase accounting impacts. Higher selling prices along with lower raw material costs contributed 70 basis points to second quarter margins. Finally, foreign currency net of hedging impacts reduced margins by 10 basis points. Overall, we effectively managed costs throughout the quarter in a very dynamic and challenging global economy, and as Mike mentioned, we expanded EBITDA margins by 110 basis points year-on-year to 26.5%. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 10 for a closer look at earnings per share. Second quarter adjusted earnings were $1.78 per share, down 16.4% year-over-year. Let me now cover the items that made up our second quarter earnings performance. Similar to the operating margin discussion on the prior slide, organic sales declines, productivity, and other actions collectively reduced year-on-year per share earnings by $0.28. Acquisitions and divestitures reduced second quarter earnings by $0.07 per share versus last year primarily due to the Acelity acquisition. Please note that this result includes financing costs associated with the acquisition. Foreign currency net of hedging was a $0.05 per share headwind in the quarter. Turning to tax rate, our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 20.7% versus 22.3% last year, adding $0.03 to earnings per share. Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined 1% versus Q2 last year, adding $0.02 to per-share earnings. Please turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. As Mike noted, we delivered strong second quarter adjusted free cash flow of $1.5 billion, up 18% year-over-year. This increase was driven by effective working capital management, disciplined capital allocation, along with a $400 million benefit related to timing of income tax payments which will be paid in the third quarter. Through the first half of the year, adjusted free cash flow increased to $2.5 billion versus $2 billion last year as we continue to generate strong free cash flow, demonstrating the strength and resiliency of our business model.  From a capital allocation perspective, our long term strategy remains unchanged. Our first priority is to invest in our business; second, maintaining our dividend; and lastly, flexible deployment for M&A and share repurchases. Second quarter capital expenditures were $379 million. For the full year, we now anticipate capex expenses of approximately $1.4 billion versus $1.3 billion previously. This increase in our full year capex budget expectations is primarily due to the pace of projects picking back up as economic activity returns. During the second quarter, we returned $846 million to our shareholders via dividends. Share repurchases remained suspended throughout the quarter given the continued global economic uncertainty. Our strong second quarter cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to strengthen our capital structure. We ended the quarter with $4.5 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand and reduced net debt by $1.7 billion or 10% in the second quarter. Please turn to Slide 12, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q2. I will start with our safety and industrial business, which declined 6% organically in the quarter. Personal safety saw strong double digit organic growth driven by continued unprecedented levels of demand for respirators globally in response to the pandemic. The balance of the safety and industrial portfolio declined significantly due to the global slowdown in industrial production activity during the quarter.  Looking geographically, the Americas declined 9% organically with the U.S. down mid single digits. EMEA declined 1% while Asia Pacific was down 4%. Safety and industrial\u2019s second quarter segment operating margins were 23.8%, up 180 basis points driven by continued strong productivity, cost actions, and benefits from last year\u2019s restructuring. Moving to transportation and electronics, second quarter sales were down 19% organically compared to last year. Our electronics-related business was down 1% with strong growth in semiconductor, factory automation, and data center, which was offset by continued softness in consumer electronics, particularly smartphones. Our automotive OEM business was down 44% year-on-year, in line with the 45% decline in global car and light truck builds. Commercial solutions declined roughly 30% while transportation safety and advanced materials were down mid and high teens respectively. Geographically, Asia Pacific declined 8% while the Americas declined 29% and EMEA was down 33%.  Transportation and electronics second quarter operating margins were 19.7%, negatively impacted by the 19% decline in organic sales which was partially offset by cost actions and benefits from last year\u2019s restructuring. Turning to healthcare, which experienced significant pandemic-related challenges and disruptions across the industry, declined 12% organically versus last year. Organic growth across much of our healthcare portfolio was negatively impacted by the effects of COVID, which resulted in delays in elective medical procedures and closed most dental offices around the world. These impacts were most prevalent in our oral care business, which was down nearly 60%, and medical solutions which declined mid single digits in Q2.  Food safety declined mid single digits as the business was impacted by the closure of food processing plants during the quarter due to worker safety concerns. A positive note, our separation and purification business grew mid single digits. This business continues to experience strong demand for biopharma filtration solutions in support of the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s research and manufacturing efforts to develop vaccines and therapeutic treatments for COVID. Looking geographically, the Americas declined 14% while EMEA and Asia Pacific each declined 10%.  Healthcare second quarter operating margins were 16.8% or down nearly 10 percentage points year-on-year. Approximately two thirds of this decline was due to the significant reduction in organic sales with the remaining one third related to the Acelity acquisition. Looking ahead, we expect both organic growth and operating margins to improve as elective procedures return. Lastly, second quarter organic growth for our consumer business was down 5%. Organic sales growth within consumer was led by our homecare business up high single digits, along with home improvement which was up low single digits. Growth in these businesses was driven by strong customer demand for our Scotchbrite cleaning products and solutions, Scotch Blue painters tape, Filtrete air filtration products, and Meguiar\u2019s car care products. Stationary and office and consumer healthcare both declined, impacted by the stay-at-home orders and social distancing protocols which resulted in many offices and schools being closed across the world.  Looking at consumer geographically, the Americas and Asia Pacific were each down mid single digits while EMEA declined 10%. Consumer\u2019s operating margins were 23.2%, up 250 basis points on strong cost discipline and ongoing productivity.  That wraps up my review of the second quarter results.  Before I turn it over to Monish, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to make a few comments given it is my last earnings call. Thirty five years ago, I started my career at 3M right out of college. I\u2019m humbled and grateful for the many opportunities and experiences I have had throughout my career, and most importantly the many wonderful people that I have gotten to know both professionally and personally around the world.  In the last six years, I\u2019ve been blessed to be the CFO of this great company and to lead 3M\u2019s global finance organization. As part of my role as CFO, I have also had the opportunity to engage with many of you in the investor community. I have greatly enjoyed the many interactions with those of you who have covered and invested in 3M. I have appreciated your support, input and feedback, and I wish you all the best in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 13 and I will hand it over to Monish to discuss our thoughts going forward. Monish?\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you Nick, and good morning everyone. First, I would like to recognize and thank Nick not only for his 35 years of outstanding service to 3M, but also for his partnership, counsel and guidance over the past month in helping me learn 3M and ensure a smooth transition.  Like Nick, I am humbled to be a part of this outstanding company. I have had great admiration of 3M and its vast scientific capabilities to positively impact the world, including and across industry, healthcare and consumers\u2019 lives. It\u2019s great to be a part of the leadership team and to lead the company\u2019s global finance organization. Over the past month, I have spent time meeting with leadership, key finance members, and also participating in strategic and operating reviews and discussions. While I have only been on the job for a few weeks, this past month has given me a great opportunity to personally engage with our leadership team and learn the company. I want to thank all 3Mers for their warm welcome. With that, let me make a few remarks regarding our thoughts on the coming quarter.  As we start the third quarter, we are seeing sequential improvements in end markets, including automotive, healthcare, and general industrial. While the strength and pace of recovery remains uncertain, we currently are expecting global economic activity to be stronger in Q3 as compared to Q2.  Turning to our business, we are seeing a broad-based pick-up in growth across our businesses and geographies as we start the third quarter. With one week left in July, total company sales are currently up low single digits year-on-year. With respect to respirators, we anticipate continued strong demand which we estimate will contribute approximately 300 to 350 basis points to company-wide Q3 organic growth. As we did throughout Q2, we will continue to provide monthly sales information, therefore we will provide an update on July sales once we have finalized results in a few weeks.  From an operational standpoint, though we anticipate some pick-up in costs as sales growth improves, we are maintaining our aggressive cost discipline while also continuing to invest in future growth and productivity, therefore looking at margins, we currently anticipate our third quarter adjusted operating income margins in the range of 20% to 21%. Finally with respect to free cash flow, we will continue our efforts to drive improvements in working capital and prioritize capex spend. Our ongoing focus on cash flow along with disciplined capital allocation are central to enhancing our financial flexibility and strengthening our capital structure.  While uncertainty remains, we are confident in our ability to continue to execute on our priorities, respond to changes in the marketplace, and invest in future growth and productivity.  With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Davis : Good morning guys.\nMichael Roman: Morning Scott.\nScott Davis: Congrats Nick on your retirement. Hope you enjoy, well done. \nNicholas Gangestad: Thank you.\nScott Davis: And Monish, good luck to you.\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you.\nScott Davis: Anyways, two questions here. One, on the cost out, how much of the $400 million would you guys say is permanent, you can hold onto, versus the more temporary action?\nNicholas Gangestad: Scott, I\u2019d say the majority of the $400 million is temporary, that much of what we were doing in second quarter was reducing expenses through disciplined holding down of expenses. There were some other things that we did of restructuring actions that we think will--that we know will benefit us going forward, but the majority of this $400 million we see as temporary spending reductions and not permanent spending reductions.\nScott Davis: Okay. Then as a follow-up, the July--I mean, I know we\u2019re only--we\u2019re not totally through the yet, close, but that seems pretty positive based on the sequential--I mean, I wouldn\u2019t have expected positive until later in the year. Can you give us a little bit of color on that? Is there any particular snapback or inventory rebuild or discretionary healthcare has started up again, things like that, that perhaps is driving that growth?\nMichael Roman: Yes Scott, maybe I\u2019ll characterize it a little, really in line with what Monish said in his remarks. It\u2019s pretty broad right across businesses and geographies. We are seeing some positive growth in China coming out of Q2, and that continues, but it\u2019s really broad-based. It is related to some of the things you highlighted - elective procedures coming back, the automotive build rate sequentially getting better, still negative but getting better, so we\u2019re seeing--I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re seeing the signs of a snapback in the inventory in the channel yet, but we\u2019re certainly early days benefiting that broader improvement across businesses and geographies.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning, and I\u2019ll echo the thanks to Nick and welcome to Monish.  Maybe just a question on the adjusted operating margin first of all. I saw the guidance of 20% to 21% for Q3. It is up slightly sequentially, but I guess year-on-year it\u2019s still a very heavy decline, maybe heavier even than what you had seen in Q2, even with a better revenue trajectory. I just wanted to try and understand if that\u2019s right, if it\u2019s maybe a three-point decline in the adjusted margin year-on-year, and maybe what\u2019s driving that to offset the better volume performance.\nNicholas Gangestad: Hey Julian. Yes, with the guide that we\u2019re putting out for third quarter margin 20% to 21%, we\u2019ve been looking at it from a sequential perspective and seeing it up 50 to 100 basis points over where we finish Q2 of this year. Now, as you\u2019re doing and looking at last year, you\u2019ve got to remember last year had some one-off things benefiting it. We had a gain on a sale of a building that\u2019s included in that. We also have the impact of Acelity year-on-year with Acelity not in our third quarter results last year but they\u2019re now in there. Those are the two biggest things impacting the year-on-year number.\nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s helpful, thank you. Then maybe my second question, if we look at the healthcare business specifically, I think there was a comment around improving margins in the prepared remarks. Maybe just put a finer point on it, I suppose, in healthcare, help us understand the pace at which the elective surgery-related businesses are coming back, and did the comment mean that margins could grow even in the second half, or it\u2019s more just a much narrower decline than what you\u2019ve seen in Q2?\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes Julian, I wouldn\u2019t take the comments to say that we expect the margins to be up year-on-year in our healthcare business. My comments there were in regards to compared to where we saw margins in the second quarter, we anticipate those continuing to expand as we see elective procedures coming back and our own volumes going up. If I use oral care as an example, each month of the second quarter we were seeing improvement in our year-on-year growth rates in that, and we expect that to continue going forward.  We\u2019re also seeing improvements on the month in our medical solutions business, so we are seeing signs that these elective procedures are coming back and we\u2019re seeing the start of that later in the second quarter, early into the third quarter, and as that continues, we expect that to have a positive impact on the sequential operating margins for healthcare. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Andrew Obin, Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Obin: Yes, good morning. Just a question, as things improve for you guys, what do you need to see, what are the goalpost--oh, I apologize. Before I go onto my question, I do want to thank Nick and welcome Monish. I apologize for skipping that, Nick. Good luck and thank you, and Monish, welcome. Apologies for that.\nNicholas Gangestad: Thank you.\nAndrew Obin: So just going back to capital allocation, what do you need to see in terms of things getting back to normal to go back to share buybacks, to go back to looking at M&A? What are the takes, what are the goal posts?\nMonish Patolawala: Thanks for the question. The way we look at it is we have said before, it\u2019s an extremely uncertain environment, so for us to look at what you call stability, we\u2019ll have to figure out what our end markets look like. Think about big end markets, whether that\u2019s healthcare, automotive, and personal safety, so until we see that stability, it\u2019s just going to be really hard for us, so I would call those as the goalposts.  Of course, how the coronavirus cases play out in the world will be another big factor in this and how the economies start opening up, so those are just some of the macro indicators that we\u2019ll have to look at before we feel comfortable, and that\u2019s why we are taking this day by day and we\u2019re going to continue providing you monthly guidance on our revenue, and then as that stabilizes I think we\u2019ll be in a better position to have a stronger view on capital allocation.\nAndrew Obin: So when you stop providing monthly guidance, I should expect buybacks? Sorry, that was a joke.  Another question, you guys have some of the strongest presence in China of anybody we cover, and we\u2019ve been reading about possible supply chain disruptions related to the Yangtze River flooding. Are you seeing any impact on your customers in China? I mean, I know where you guys are, but are you seeing any impact from flooding on your supply chain or are you making any contingency plans? Just trying to figure out how real that thing is. Thanks.\nMichael Roman: Yes Andrew, through the entire COVID experience, we really have validated the model that we have around the world. As you know we manufacture in China a majority of what we sell in China, so we really are closely connected with the supply chains there, and I would say at this point we don\u2019t see an impact from the flooding. We\u2019re watching it closely, we\u2019re staying connected to our customers as they see interruptions. If it worsens or their businesses are interrupted, we will certainly adjust in the supply chain, but at this point we don\u2019t see a material impact on the China results.  We\u2019re seeing fairly broad-based improvements really across electronics and industrial and transportation markets leading the way. Like the U.S., elective procedures in healthcare are a little slower to recover, but it\u2019s fairly broad-based in that growth that we saw in Q2. So not at this time, but we will stay close to it and update as we go.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hey guys, good morning. Can you just discuss where you stand on some of the cost actions for second half? I know you said you got $400 million out in second quarter, but maybe just discuss what you\u2019re getting in second half and the how that temporary versus structural plays into next year, just assuming flat sales for example, even though they probably won\u2019t be flat, just what you see as temporary and structural now. Just an update there. \nMonish Patolawala: Sure Steve. So as Nick mentioned in his prepared remarks and the prior question, most of the actions that were taken in the second quarter were temporary in nature. We have taken some structural actions through a restructuring charge, but most of them were temporary in nature. I would say we are going to continue our strong cost discipline that we are doing, but at the same time as the economic recovery starts coming back up, we are going to see investments in both growth and productivity, as well as some of the timing items in 2Q will play back out in Q3 and Q4, so that\u2019s our current view right now.  As I said, uncertain environment, but depending on which way the world plays out, we are ready to act in both investing in growth and productivity at the same time.\nSteve Tusa: So I guess that sounds like for--I guess that sounds just pretty--you know, performance next year will be pretty consistent to normal incremental margins on growth, with maybe just the 2Q temporary actions as the key item to call out?\nMonish Patolawala: As of right now, I would say that, Steve; but again, as I said, let\u2019s see how the world plays out. We\u2019ll act both on growth and productivity as required. But for Q3, again, looking at the cost actions, just to reiterate, we are looking at as sequential revenue goes up, margin rate is going to go up to 20% to 21%, which is 50 to 150 BPs better than Q2.\nSteve Tusa: Right, okay. Thanks a lot, I appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Nigel Coe, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, good morning. Nick, good luck, and Monish, good luck in your new role as well. I just wanted to touch quickly on July versus June. I wasn\u2019t on for the whole prepared remarks, but what caused the big snap in--you know, it looks like mid-teens declines in June on a daily basis, and then snapping into positive growth in July. Is that positive growth, is that inclusive of acquisitions or is that purely organic? Just wondering what changed between the two months.\nMichael Roman: Yes, so the growth was all in sales, Nigel, so it\u2019s both acquisitions and organic. I would say that broad-based view of businesses and geographies, it\u2019s adding up everywhere a little bit. That\u2019s what\u2019s making the difference, and we\u2019re seeing demand come back. There was a lot of--I think a lot of optimism that we were seeing an economic recovery at the end of second quarter, and we saw pretty consistent organic growth across the months in the quarter. We\u2019re seeing it come through now in July, so it\u2019s just, I would say, the timing of it and that broad-based across businesses and geographies is adding up to improving trends. I\u2019m encouraged by what I see.  It\u2019s still early days in the third quarter, but we\u2019re off to a good start, and I think it\u2019s a start of a trend in those markets is the cause of it.\nNigel Coe: Yes, I\u2019d be curious if there\u2019s any channel impacts that\u2019s causing that, but my follow-on question is really on healthcare margins. I think the best way to think about these is on an EBITDA basis, and we saw sequentially EBITDA margins declining from 28% down to 24.1%. Obviously volumes took a big step down in 1Q versus 2Q. Is that just purely a volume impact that we\u2019re seeing there, or were there some mix impacts that we need to figure in as well?\nMichael Roman: Nigel, before I give it to Nick, maybe just a comment about the channel at the end there. We did see some strong point of sale as we came through second quarter, so there was expectation that sell-in would follow. That\u2019s probably contributing some of it, but we aren\u2019t seeing a big, as I said earlier, a big snapback in the channel, but there has been stronger point of sale, so that\u2019s also contributing.\nNigel Coe: Okay, thanks.\nNicholas Gangestad: Nigel, to your question on the EBITDA margins for healthcare, and yes, we\u2019re seeing that down, and your presumption is correct. What we are seeing there is almost all volume related when we look at it on an EBITDA basis, because then we\u2019re pulling out the impact of the Acelity purchase accounting impact. It\u2019s almost all volume related, and then again, as we see volumes coming back up, we expect that to abate and come back to more normal operating margins for our healthcare business.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of John Walsh, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning, and a thank you to Nick and a welcome to Monish.\nNicholas Gangestad: Thank you John.\nJohn Walsh: Wanted to go back to the Q3 margin guidance. I was trying to calculate the year-on-year decline if I make adjustments for the flame detection gain last year, the property gain which you kind of sized in the prepared remarks last year, and it seems like the year-on-year delta actually gets worse in Q3 versus Q2. Wanted to know, one, if that math was right or if we missed something there. \nMonish Patolawala: The way to look at it, John, I think the reason we went to incremental quarter-over-quarter or sequential is because it\u2019s so hard to do the math year-on-year. There were some gains last time as well as we\u2019ve got the impact of the Acelity acquisition this year, and that\u2019s why I would just request that you focus on the sequential, and that\u2019s where we are showing margin improvement of 50 to 150 basis points as we go forward, as volume starts getting better. \nJohn Walsh: Okay, thank you for that. Then maybe just a follow-up, thinking about price raws for the back half here. Price ticked up, was just curious where you\u2019re actually seeing an acceleration in getting price, maybe by the segment units because we already have it by the geography.\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes, so we\u2019re at 50 basis points of price growth in the second quarter, and we don\u2019t foresee that having a material change in the second half of the year. What we\u2019ve been experiencing for price growth, both for the first and the second quarter, we think is pretty indicative of where we\u2019ll be for the total year. John, there\u2019s really not any big trend change going on there to highlight. It\u2019s been a very stable number and we think it will remain stable.\nJohn Walsh: Great, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks, good morning everyone. I will echo all the comments - we\u2019ll miss you, Nick, and look forward to working with you, Monish.\nMonish Patolawala: Same here, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Maybe just my first question, maybe following up on Nigel\u2019s question on healthcare margins, if we were to take out the Acelity acquisition from 2Q, what were the core decrementals in 2Q in healthcare?\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes Joe, the core decrementals in healthcare once I pull out Acelity, then we\u2019re in 60% or a little higher than 60%, which is not unusual given the make-up of our cost structure in healthcare. Once I pull out Acelity, then we\u2019re in that range. \nJoe Ritchie: That\u2019s helpful. Nick, just following up on a comment you made earlier, so none of that is mix related, like elective procedures isn\u2019t exacerbating that decremental? It\u2019s just basically volume oriented and that\u2019s it?\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes, when we look at a mix impact, we have pluses and minuses. It really nets out to very little change on our overall healthcare margin. \nJoe Ritchie: Okay, all right. Thanks. Then maybe one follow-on question, just going back to the comments around capital deployment and when you could potentially get more aggressive with a buyback or M&A. The question I have is how are you thinking about your balance sheet and your leverage going forward? There\u2019s a lot of moving pieces clearly from a PFAS perspective, and so I\u2019m just wondering whether you\u2019re thinking about your leverage in a different way when we start thinking about you getting a little bit more aggressive in the future.\nMonish Patolawala: Sure, so I will just start by saying a hallmark of 3M has been its strong capital structure, and our plan is to continue doing that. De-leveraging has been a priority for 3M and we are going to continue that journey. I think the pace of de-leveraging will depend on how economic activity recovers and also our ability to continue driving strong cash flow and control our working capital. That\u2019s what I would just say for the time being is our current view. To reiterate capital allocation, our first priority has always been to invest in the business. It\u2019s R&D organic growth, best returns right there. Dividend is our second, which has been a big hallmark of 3M, that\u2019s our second priority, and then M&A is third, and then share buybacks would be our last priority. That\u2019s the way we are looking at it right now.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you, good morning everyone. Nick, 35 years? You look so young! I thought maybe you started out in middle school. Best of luck to you.\nNicholas Gangestad: Jeff, you\u2019re kind. Thank you.\nJeff Sprague: Just two business related questions for me, if I could. First on electronics, can you just provide a little more color on what you saw there? It sounds like kind of a tale of two markets, right, consumer electronics versus the other buckets. Can you give us a little more color on what you saw in the quarter in those pieces, and what the trajectory looks like into the third quarter?\nMichael Roman: Yes Jeff, electronics for us was down 1%, and as you said, it was kind of a mix of different stories. There was strength in semiconductor, data centers, factory automation. Those were all up double digits for us. Those have been part of our focus on where we invest for growth in electronics. That was offset by softness in consumer electronics. The broader transportation electronics was impacted more heavily by automotive and, I would say, our commercial solutions business, but in electronics the strength was in those categories. We see those trends continuing. Semiconductor fabrication continues robust growth. Consumer electronics is still soft as we start third quarter, but the benefit of being in those higher growth segments gave us some strength in electronics in the quarter.\nJeff Sprague: Secondly, unrelated, on the consumer side, obviously potentially a very peculiar back to school, or maybe we don\u2019t even have back to school this year. What is going on in retail in terms of planning for this channel fill, that sort of thing, and what are you expecting in the third quarter?\nMichael Roman: Well, our retail partners are planning for back to school, and as you said, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around it. It\u2019s another one of those things that\u2019s almost day by day. We are--we built a little bit of inventory even as we went through the first half and anticipation of back to school. We see that being something that is going to add to some of the growth as we move forward, but it\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around how it\u2019s going to play out. The strength in consumer for us has been around home improvement and our cleaning products. Stationary and office had been declining as schools were closed, of course. We\u2019re hoping to see an uptick in demand as schools open, but that still remains to be seen.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Deane Dray, RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Thank you, good morning everyone, and echo best of luck to Nick and welcome to Monish. \nNicholas Gangestad: Thanks Deane.\nDeane Dray: I\u2019m not surprised that air quality is one of the priorities for 3M. You\u2019ve got such a big presence on the residential side with Filtrete. Where and how do you see opportunities on the commercial building side on filtration as people start venturing back to work? Are there new products that you\u2019re expecting to launch?\nMichael Roman: Yes Deane, you hit it. Our innovation and really a core of what we do in Filtrete has been focused on residential, both indoor air quality and, I would say, residential HVAC, together with room air purifiers being part of that. Our innovation goes into the Filtrete filters that are part of that.  The commercial side, while we contribute some of our non-woven technology, it\u2019s not a big part of our air quality growth. It\u2019s one of those areas that it\u2019s still nascent in how the innovation is going to make a difference there. We work in our innovation on opportunities there, but when we talk about the outlook for the strength in this area and the growth that we\u2019re seeing in our priority growth platform, it\u2019s really in that residential side of the marketplace. \nDeane Dray: Got it. Then for 2020, how do new product introductions shape up - again, this is a strange year, but in terms of product launches and contributions?\nMichael Roman: Yes, it\u2019s still the heart of 3M is our innovation. It comes through in those new product launches. We highlighted a little bit the benefit we\u2019re seeing in these priority growth platforms, but it\u2019s much broader than that. We continue to launch new products and like everything else, we\u2019re adjusting in the middle of COVID, prioritizing where we see market opportunities, and I would say in some cases you see in our capex delaying some of the investments as we see slowness in markets. Now, we have plans for robust new product launches in the second half of the year. It\u2019s going to be still a critical part of our growth drivers, so it doesn\u2019t change, we just have to adjust to the market opportunities, and I would say too the pace of investment as we go through the rest of the year.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Andy Kaplowitz, Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning guys. Nick, thanks for all your help, much appreciated. Monish, welcome.\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you.\nNicholas Gangestad: Thanks Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Just focusing on safety and industrial for a second, the margin performance in the quarter was strong. Can you give us a little more color in terms of what led to the margin improvement in the quarter? Is the big increase in mask sales actually helping mix? Is it realignment that that\u2019s now helping that segment, and would you expect to see this kind of performance we saw in safety and industrial moving forward?\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes Andy, in total the fact that our revenue was down year-on-year, we\u2019re not seeing a benefit margin in our safety and industrial business from the combination of the higher respirator sales and the lower sales in the rest. Those look pretty much as a push to us. The 180 basis point margin expansion, some of that is coming from that $400 million of cost actions that we\u2019re doing, that safety and industrial had its share of that, but this was also a business where we were taking actions last year in restructuring, so the lack of repeat of that expense plus the positive benefit of that restructuring, all of those things in combination led to that 180 basis point margin expansion. It\u2019s really not a mix or a respirator story.  Then going forward, we do see continued margin expansion potential in this business going forward, possibly not on the same scale as what we saw here in regards to the margin guidance that we provided, but it\u2019s still a business where we see upside on the margin on a year-on-year basis. \nAndy Kaplowitz: Thanks for that, Nick. Then just focusing geographically again, China seems to be continuing to improve, but Japan looked worse and Latin America looked expectedly weak, so can you talk about Asia and some of the other emerging markets? It seems like China continues with more of a V-shaped recovery for you guys. Is that what you\u2019re seeing? And then why did Japan turn down in Q2?\nMichael Roman: Yes Andy, we are seeing that recovery in China, and I highlighted earlier it\u2019s really across safety and industrial, transportation and electronics leading the improvements there as we move ahead. Healthcare is still slow as elective surgeries even--or elective procedures come back in China as well. We are--you know, we see that, as I highlighted, continuing as we start the third quarter. Japan was down 12% in the quarter, really seeing declines in safety industrial and consumer, transportation electronics as well, so it\u2019s a broad-based slowness there. I think we\u2019re seeing that across geographies, that there\u2019s kind of a sequence to things. You\u2019re seeing the earlier recovery in China, then you see EMEA, Americas, and Japan, other parts of Asia kind of going through--a step behind that, and we saw some of that in Japan as we went through the second quarter. \nOperator: The last question is from Markus Mittermaier, UBS. Go ahead.\nMarkus Mittermaier: Hi, good morning everyone, and again welcome Monish, thanks Nick for all your help, and all the best.\nNicholas Gangestad: Thanks Markus.\nMarkus Mittermaier: If I can maybe come back to just the monthly data - sorry for that. Mike, Nick, when we spoke intra-quarter, we talked about the billing day adjustments that we would have to make in May and June, and if I do that arithmetic, I actually see June down significantly more than May was, which surprised me a bit. Then correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but did you say July, the low single digit number, was that all-in or was that organic? Maybe let\u2019s start here.\nNicholas Gangestad: Yes, when we look at on a per-billing day sales from April to May to June, we saw an improvement each of those months. However, that\u2019s a normal pattern for us. It\u2019s a normal pattern as we go through the second quarter that May and June sales per billing day goes up, and we saw that again this year. So in a year-on-year growth comparison, what we saw on a per-billing day was very comparable, about the same growth on a sales per billing day in May as what we saw in June. What we\u2019re seeing now in July is now a more noticeable direction change, where on a sales per billing day and on an absolute basis, we are seeing it up low single digits versus where we were in July of last year.\nMarkus Mittermaier: Okay, thank you. Maybe I\u2019ll come back to that after the call, just to make sure. Then on the interim consent order with ADEM in your prepared remarks, is that something that you had already provisioned for before, because in the special items, if I look at it, there were no litigation-related charges in the quarter. Is that something that\u2019s still coming up, or is that something that was already provisioned for in the past?\nMichael Roman: Markus, the announcement on ADEM, that\u2019s something that we had previously disclosed, and we\u2019ve reached an interim consent order in partnership with ADEM, so this will have requirements as we move ahead. What we know about remediation that\u2019s probable and estimable is part of our reserve, but there will also be capital and operating costs that go along with complying with the consent order. It\u2019s not expected to be material for 3M, but it is something that will become part of our operational costs as we move ahead.\nOperator: That concludes the question and answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing remarks. \nMichael Roman: To wrap up, the 3M team delivered another strong operational performance in the second quarter. In a challenging environment, we posted robust cash flow, managed costs, and continued to invest for the future.  We will continue to fight COVID-19 from all angles, and we are well positioned to deliver value for our customers and shareholders during the pandemic and as the economy recovers.  Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."}, {"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 1, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-04-28 15:08:08", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, April 28, 2020. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2020 business review. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chief Executive Officer; and Nick Gangestad our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Nick will make some formal comments and then we'll take your questions. Please note that, today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Please turn to slide 2. Before we begin let me remind you of the dates for our upcoming 2020 quarterly earnings conference calls, which will be held on July 28 and October 27. Also please note given the uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have not set a date for an investor meeting later this year. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Finally, throughout today's presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release. Please note, we have provided segment and total company adjusted EBITDA reconciliations for reference in today's press release attachments as part of our non-GAAP measures. Please turn to slide 4, and I'll hand it off to Mike.\nMike Roman: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning everyone. I hope you and your families are safe, and I thank you for joining us. Let me also take this opportunity to say how much we appreciate and admire everything our heroic nurses, doctors and first responders around the world are doing to fight COVID-19. And I'd like to share this sentiment with our employees. In this unprecedented time, I could not be more proud of how you have stepped up to help protect those on the front lines of this crisis. I would like to also recognize those 3Mers in our manufacturing and distribution sites who in these most challenging circumstances continue to work around the clock to accelerate production of respirators and other critical supplies. I thank all of our people for your tireless efforts and your incredible work. At 3M, we have a unique and critical responsibility in pandemic preparedness and response. Our response throughout COVID-19 has been guided by our purpose as an enterprise and shaped by these three principles. First an uncompromising commitment to the safety of our employees; second, fighting the pandemic with urgency from all angles, including everything we're doing to help protect health care workers and first responders; and third, maintaining business continuity, executing actions to deliver for our customers and shareholders and to lead out of the economic slowdown. Please turn to slide 5. In January, we mobilized 3M's crisis action team to coordinate our response to COVID-19. This team meets daily to ensure we are addressing our highest priorities, which as I mentioned starts with protecting the safety and well-being of our people. Our learnings from China which was impacted by the virus first helped guide our actions worldwide and made a significant difference in our ability to rapidly prepare and respond. We moved quickly to implement remote work, where possible across the enterprise. And today approximately half of our employees are working from home including myself. In our plants and other facilities where remote work isn't feasible we have instituted robust safety protocols. These include stringent, cleaning and medical screening, along with staggering shifts and reorganizing how we work to increase social distancing. COVID-19 is impacting all of us, both professionally and personally. But for some it's much more serious than others. For 3Mers personally affected by the virus, we have implemented pandemic support policies to help protect their pay and benefits and allow them to take care of themselves and their families. The situation is changing daily sometimes hourly, and we will continue to assess the safety of our people and facilities to ensure their well-being and comply with government directives. Please turn to Slide 6. As we protect our own employees, we continue to work urgently to protect the public, including health care workers and first responders. 3M is a longtime leader in personal safety with a range of science-based solutions for respiratory, face, hearing and fall protection, which goes to the heart of our vision of improving every life. This includes our N95 respirators, which 3M pioneered nearly 50 years ago and which we have continuously refined and improved ever since. Our largest production of N95 respirators is in the U.S. at two plants in South Dakota and Nebraska. And we also manufacture them in Asia Pacific, Europe and Latin America. After SARS in the early 2000s, we made the decision to prepare for future crises by investing in significant surge capacity at each of our respirator plants around the world. This additional capacity has largely remained idle for the last two decades, except for emergencies such as H1N1, the Japanese tsunami and wildfires in California and Australia. As you know, compared to prior emergencies, COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented explosion in demand. When the virus broke out, we were able to immediately activate our surge capacity and maximize production to support the public health response. Beginning in January, 3M doubled our global output of N95 respirators to 1.1 billion per year or about 100 million per month, including 35 million per month in the U.S. We've made additional investments and are also working with the Department of Defense to double annual production once again to two billion by the end of this year with additional capacity already beginning to come online. In the U.S., we will be producing N95 respirators at a rate of roughly 50 million per month in June, a 40% increase from current levels. We are also partnering with other companies on innovative solutions to protect those on the front lines. In collaboration with multiple sterilization companies, we have introduced new methods for hospitals to safely clean and reuse their N95 respirators. We are also working with Ford and Cummins to expand production of 3M's powered air purifying respirators with a plan to increase capacity by tenfold within the next 60 to 90 days. Protecting people in this crisis is not just a 3M challenge; it's an industry-wide challenge. Even with 3M's accelerated production the stark reality is that global demand for respirators far outpaces the ability of the entire industry to deliver. That is why as we urgently expand capacity, we are also prioritizing and triaging our supplies to the most critical needs. We move quickly within days of regulatory approval to redirect more than 90% of our respirators into health care with the rest deployed to other critical industries such as energy and food. Within individual regions and countries, we are working with government agencies such as FEMA and distribution partners to identify and serve hotspots. In addition as the pandemic unfolds in different stages globally, we are working with governments to address trade restrictions and regulatory standards, so we can redirect supplies around the world. For example, in early April, 3M and the U.S. government announced a plan to import 166 million respirators, primarily from our plant in China. 20 million of these respirators have already shipped via the FEMA airbridge, with a total of 40 million expected by the end of this month. This would not have been possible without the partnership of the White House. I would like to thank the President and his team for their leadership, the FDA for extending its emergency use authorization and FEMA for their work in expediting the import of product to the U.S. This plan is enabling us to maximize support for the U.S. and other areas in urgent need including Europe, Central and Latin America and Canada. We also continue to aggressively fight fraud, price gouging and other illegal and unethical activity. 3M has not and would never raise prices as a result of this crisis. And we are executing a multi-pronged strategy to pursue and deter unscrupulous behavior that is causing real harm to the public. We created a fraud hotline, published our list prices for N95 respirators and are collaborating closely with partners to ensure that supply chains are secure. While virtually all of those engaging in predatory practices have no relationship with 3M, we have in a few instances terminated distributors in our industrial channel for acting unethically or in violation of their agreements. We have also filed multiple lawsuits and continue to make referrals to law enforcement, take down counterfeit websites and remove deceptive social media posts. Beyond personal protective equipment, 3M Science is leading the fight against COVID-19 in other significant areas as well. We are providing biopharma filtration and purification solutions to support the development of vaccines and therapeutics, including multiple drugs in current trials. Our advanced membrane technology is being utilized in blood oxygenation procedures and medical devices, vital treatments for some of the sickest patients. We are helping hospitals in New York City and elsewhere quickly connect their temporary facilities and are providing leading software and coding solutions at no cost during this critical period of time, enabling frontline workers to better manage the surge in patient volume. 3M has also donated $20 million to support health care workers, vulnerable populations and scientific research. In summary, I am proud of how 3M is helping lead the fight against COVID-19 and we have launched a comprehensive website on 3M.com with more details on our response and other valuable information. Please turn to Slide 7. 3M is leading from a position of strength. And in these challenging times the benefits of our business model have never been clearer. We are a science and manufacturing powerhouse with strong capabilities and brands across the world with our greatest capabilities here in the United States. In the U.S., we have nearly 80 manufacturing plants and distribution centers, anchoring communities in 29 states across the country. 3M has never left our home country and has continuously expanded our U.S. capabilities. Over half of our research and development and capital investments are in the U.S. And every year we export $5 billion in goods to other nations from our robust U.S. manufacturing base. At the same time over the decades we have also built out robust capabilities around the world, to be close to customers and better serve the unique needs of regional and local markets. These global capabilities include plants and distribution centers in 54 countries along with three global R&D centers in Asia and Europe. In this crisis, our model has enabled us to respond with agility and add scale including the rapid deployment of personal safety equipment that we just talked about. It is also enabling us to maintain business continuity, continue to serve our customers and ensure the integrity of our supply chain, which brings me to Slide 8. I am pleased how our team is managing through the pandemic and adjusting our operations to the realities of this fast-changing situation. This includes working closely with our customers to modify our supply and demand plans. Our critical sites are fully operational, though we have implemented some targeted plant or line shutdowns due to weak customer demand or government mandates. Overall, as of late April, roughly three quarters of our plants and distribution centers, remain fully or partially operational. And to support 3Mers impacted by shutdowns, we have implemented a short-term paid furlough program. In this crisis, I'm especially encouraged of the benefits we are seeing from the new global operating model we rolled out at the start of this year. As part of our new model, we consolidated manufacturing, supply chain and customer operations into a seamless end-to-end enterprise operations organization. This team is enabling us to maintain strong customer service, streamlined decision-making and adjust faster than ever to the external environment. As an example, we have reduced our production planning cycle times by 70% across our portfolio of businesses. In addition, our new corporate affairs organization has increased our collaboration with governments around the world while enhancing our employee and community engagement. Beyond our operations, we are also executing financial actions to deliver 2020 and set us up for success in 2021 and beyond. We are maintaining critical investments in organic growth through R&D, including in personal safety and other priority areas. At the same time, we are aggressively managing costs, a continuation of our relentless focus on efficiency and productivity improvements. We have already implemented sharp spending reductions, including a global hiring freeze, limiting our use of temporary contract workers and cutting indirect costs across the enterprise. In total, we expect these reductions to result in cost savings of $350 million to $400 million in the second quarter. We're also adjusting CapEx plans as we delay or experience slowdowns in certain projects. And we have suspended our share repurchase programs as of March 20. Importantly, we remain committed to our dividend as a high priority for capital allocation. Overall, these steps will help protect our company as we manage through this uncertain period and we are prepared to respond with additional actions as needed. Please turn to Slide 9 Given the diversity of our businesses, the financial impact of COVID-19 is mixed across 3M. Some areas of our portfolio are experiencing high demand while others are facing steep declines. In the first quarter we saw strong growth in personal safety as well as in other areas such as home improvement, retail cleaning products, food safety and biopharma filtration. At the same time, we saw weak demand in several other end markets with the biggest slowdowns in oral care, automotive, aerospace and general industrial. The slowdowns in these markets accelerated in the second half of March, as many countries began to shut down their economies. With respect to geographic trends, we saw mixed performance across Asia Pacific, with significant declines early in the year and gradual improvement in March. The Americas held steady through most of the quarter with the U.S. up 4%. Though beginning in mid-March, we saw a significant deceleration in both the Americas and EMEA. All in, we delivered organic growth company-wide of 30 basis points, along with adjusted earnings of $2.16 per share, solid margins of 21% and a double-digit increase in cash flow. In summary, I'm confident in our ability to lead through this crisis and emerge even stronger. Our execution against our four strategic priorities: portfolio, transformation, innovation, and people and culture, has positioned us well leading into this downturn. Going forward, a continued focus on these priorities, combined with the actions we are taking, will enable us to deliver even greater value for our customers, shareholders, and all stakeholders as the economy recovers. hat wraps up my opening comments. I'll come back to discuss our guidance after Nick takes you through the details of the quarter. Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I will start on slide 10, and review the first quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide first quarter sales were $8.1 billion with adjusted operating income of $1.7 billion and adjusted operating margins of 20.8%. On the right-hand side of this slide, you see the components of our margin performance in the first quarter. Solid underlying productivity in the quarter along with benefits from our Q2, 2019 restructuring actions contributed 40 basis points to the margins. This result includes COVID-19-related asset write-downs, which negatively impacted margins by 40 basis points. Acquisitions and divestitures combined reduced margins by 90 basis points. This impact is primarily due to the integration and amortization costs associated with our acquisition of Acelity. Higher selling prices along with lower raw material costs together, contributed 40 basis points to first quarter margins. And finally, foreign currency net of hedging impacts reduced margins by 40 basis points. Let's now turn to slide 11 for a closer look at earnings per share. First quarter adjusted earnings were $2.16 per share down 3% year-over-year. Looking at the components of our year-on-year earnings performance, solid productivity and benefits from Q2 2019 restructuring actions increased first quarter per share earnings by $0.07. This includes a negative $0.04 impact from the asset write-downs related to COVID-19 mentioned on the prior slide. Acquisitions and divestitures reduced first quarter earnings by $0.05 per share versus last year, primarily due to the Acelity acquisition. Please note that this result includes financing costs associated with the acquisition. Foreign currency net of hedging was an $0.08 per share headwind in the quarter. Turning to tax rate, our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 20.6% versus 19.5% last year, lowering earnings per share by $0.03. And finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined 1% versus Q1 last year adding $0.03 to per share earnings. Please turn to slide 12 for a discussion of our balance sheet and liquidity. One of the hallmarks of 3M is our strong balance sheet along with our time-tested business model which generates strong cash flow through economic cycles. As Mike mentioned we have taken proactive steps during the first quarter to protect and enhance the company's financial flexibility in this uncertain time. With respect to our balance sheet, we had cash and marketable securities on hand of $4.5 billion as of the end of March. This includes $1.75 billion in additional liquidity from last month's debt issuance. We are well capitalized to meet our two upcoming debt maturities, totaling $1.2 billion this year, one in May and another in August. Additionally, we have multiple sources of liquidity. First and foremost a business that generates strong free cash flow. In the first quarter, we had adjusted free cash flow of approximately $900 million with adjusted free cash flow conversion of 74%. Also we continue to expect the drug delivery divestiture to close in the second quarter, providing approximately $400 million in after-tax proceeds. From a capital allocation perspective, our long-term strategy remains unchanged. Our first priority is to invest in our business; and second, maintaining our dividend; and lastly, flexible deployment for M&A and share repurchases. While we continue to invest in the business in the near term, we are taking actions and adjusting our 2020 capital allocation plans. As a result, we are lowering our full year CapEx budget to approximately $1.3 billion from a range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion previously. This expectation includes investing an additional $100 million to continue to expand our output of respirators. In addition, in March we suspended our share repurchase program. And finally, we are aggressively managing discretionary spending to preserve financial flexibility. That wraps up my prepared remarks. Please turn to Slide 13 and I'll hand it back over to Mike. Mike?\nMike Roman: Thank you, Nick. I'll start by providing an update on the market trends we're seeing so far in April. On a geographic basis, we're seeing ongoing improvements in Asia Pacific, most notably in China where the virus first emerged. However, we continue to experience significant downturns in the U. S., Europe and Latin America, areas that remain in the throes of the crisis. I can share that we are seeing a slowdown in growth during the first several weeks of Q2, with total company organic growth through late April down in the mid-teens. We anticipate continued strong demand for respirators, which we expect to contribute approximately 150 basis points to company-wide Q2 growth. At the same time, we expect ongoing weakness in other end markets through Q2, including oral care, automotive, office supplies and general industrial. Due to this end market uncertainty, at this time, we are unable to adequately quantify the impacts to our business for the remainder of the year. Therefore, we are temporarily withdrawing our 2020 guidance, until we have better visibility of the duration and impact of the slowdown. At this time, we believe Q2 results will be especially challenged, given the trends we have seen so far in April, with revenue and EPS declines year-over-year. In lieu of guidance, starting in May, we will provide monthly updates on how our business is performing and we will continue to provide this until we are better able to forecast future performance. Please turn to slide 14. To wrap up, our strong fundamentals and position with customers across industries provides a firm foundation during this time of uncertainty. We may not know the exact shape of the recovery, but we are well prepared for a wide range of scenarios and are taking actions to prepare us to lead out of this slowdown. Before turning to Q&A, I'd like to once again thank all 3Mers for your tremendous work and for everything you're doing in this unprecedented moment. I'm very proud to represent 3M and our people around the world. Going forward, we'll continue to do all we can to protect our employees, protect our enterprise and help the world get through this crisis. That concludes our remarks and we'll now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nAndrew Obin: Good morning.\nMike Roman: Hey, Andrew.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: It's great to see 3M finally doing what 3M always does. Congratulations.\nNick Gangestad: Thank you.\nAndrew Obin: Just first question, just a big picture question. In terms of your capacity additions in nonwovens and specifically respirators, how do you think the industry will change, because you're not the only ones adding capacity? Lots of capacity added in China. All of a sudden you have Honeywell showing up in North America and Europe. What does it mean for competitive environment two years out?\nMike Roman: Yes. Andrew, it's a little hard to look two years out. But, certainly, as we think about capacity expansion that we're doing today, a big part of that is in that category of surge capacity for situations like we're facing with COVID-19, there is going to be, we think, a significant tail to demand in this. You can look out. There's demand from governments from healthcare and there's also ongoing demand in the industry as industry comes back from economic slowdown. So we're mapping all of that into our capacity and then we're working with governments and the Department of Defense in the U. S. to plan for capacity that would be dedicated to their needs in a COVID-like crisis. So I think it's really lined up well with what we see as ongoing market and industry demand. And we're looking obviously broader than just our capacity. We're looking at the marketplace and the capabilities. And we're focusing here on N95 and just really respiratory solutions that meet those requirements. So I think it's got a view as far as we can see it. As we look out further beyond, you said, a couple of years out its going to depend on where we end up in those big end markets, healthcare and industrial.\nAndrew Obin: And just on an unrelated topic, I think, there were some news items. I think, Bloomberg reported some sort of developments in the hearing protection lawsuits. Can you just -- and it's interesting, I guess, the message is on pricing and disclosure. And, I guess, in light that you guys actually published list for N95. But can you just comment where you are in terms of this hearing protection lawsuit? And any comment sort of on the Bloomberg article? Thank you.\nMike Roman: Yes. Thank you, Andrew. Let me start here. 3M has great respect for the brave men and women who protect us around the world. And we have a long history of partnering with the U. S. military and we continue to be committed to making safe products. We've worked in close coordination with them and 3M did not withhold information from the government about fit and use of this product. The narrative out there is misleading and really lacks context. So, I think it's -- we will defend ourselves. And we deny that our product was defectively designed. So, I would just say that, that narrative is very misleading.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you very much and congratulations on a great quarter..\nMike Roman: Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nMike Roman: Hi, Deane.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: I'd also like to add my appreciation for all the 3M has done to help health care workers globally. And in my view that's exactly the kind of corporate citizen we'd expect 3M to respond and so, congratulations to everybody.\nMike Roman: Yeah. Thanks, Deane.\nNick Gangestad: Thank you.\nDeane Dray: A number of companies have in lieu of -- considering suspending guidance they've been offering some scenario analysis or sensitivity in terms of how the year could play out, in terms of decrementals, margins. Can you take a stab at that? And how might this all compare to the financial crisis of 2008, 2009, if we use that as kind of a benchmark? Could we start there please?\nNick Gangestad: Yeah. Deane I'll take that one. First of all, of course we like I think any other company we're going through a number of scenarios. And while I don't plan to share the different scenarios because this is a dynamic situation, a couple of things I will share. First of all, we -- as Mike noted, as we go through this quarter. And until we see a reason to change that we're going to be providing monthly revenue to give you the insight of what's going on with our businesses in different geographies. In addition, you heard Mike talk about the cost-saving actions that we are -- that we've implemented for Q2. And inclusive of that, we expect in the second quarter that we will be seeing decremental margins between 30% and 40%. And now that's inclusive of the $350 million to $400 million of cost saving actions. So, between sharing the revenue, each month as we see it and this -- and our view on, decremental margins, we think that gives you some insight, as to what you can be expecting from us from an earnings perspective, as we're going forward.\nDeane Dray: That's a helpful start. And then, could you also clarify since this is -- and we appreciate getting the monthly revenue updates. You just suggested we could be getting it by geography. Will you also be sharing -- will it be organic and also by segment?\nNick Gangestad: We think organic is the best way to share this. And that's our plan right now. And we do plan to be providing insights of what's going on by both, business and geography.\nDeane Dray: Okay. That's going to be really helpful, so I appreciate it. Just last question, it got cited but not clarified. What were the asset write-downs that were COVID-related? You sized it. But what were the businesses and why?\nNick Gangestad: Those are -- within our company we have -- what we call new ventures, where we're investing venture capital in a number of places of emerging technologies that we think will complement the 3M business model. These were some mark-to-market actions. All or virtually all were felt within the [core] [ph] miscellaneous aspect of our company.\nDeane Dray: But why were those COVID-related?\nNick Gangestad: As a result of changes in triggering events, in terms of the value of those companies that, we saw that as COVID-related.\nDeane Dray: Okay. Thank you. Good luck to everyone. Stay healthy. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nSteve Tusa: Hi guys. Good morning.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Steve.\nNick Gangestad: Hi Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, sorry if I missed this busy earnings morning. But the $350 million to $450 million in costs in the second quarter that's a pretty big number. Does that -- is there kind of carry forward into the \u2013 sorry, in the second quarter. Does that carry forward in like the third and the fourth? And how much of that is temporary? How much of that was from last year's restructuring? Just unclear to me what's included there? Sorry if I missed you detailing it earlier in the call. I'm sure you did. But I missed -- I might have missed that. Thanks.\nNick Gangestad: Yeah. Steve, I'll go through a few of those details. First of all, it is taking actions on a number of components of cost structure. The first and the biggest component is things what we internal to 3M called indirect costs, things that are not payroll or raw material cost related. So, travel, external services, temporary workers, targeted ad merch, things like that we are working on bringing that spending down, in line with what we're seeing happen in the external market. We've also frozen any new hiring. And in the case of with employees there are some parts of the world where we have put employees on required mandatory use of vacation. So, those are the things that are driving that. In terms of carry forward into future quarters, I'd say Steve it's just volatile now that -- and flexible that some of it, or much of it may carry forward depending on what we see, but not necessarily depending on the type of recovery that 3M sees in the coming quarters.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. So you seem to, kind of, have yet to take structural action -- incremental structural action beyond what you guys did last year, which is what most companies are doing just by the way.\nNick Gangestad: That is correct Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And then one last one just on how you're approaching this environment. The inventories, a lot of companies are keeping a little bit of a buffer stock. Have you guys maintained that buffer stock, or have you continued to work down inventories from where they were last year?\nMike Roman: Yeah, Steve one of the things I highlighted in my prepared remarks was how our enterprise operations bringing together manufacturing supply chain and customer operations together into one organization that we launched at the beginning of the year. It's really been benefiting us and this is another area where really we continue to take down days of inventory outstanding. So we do have plans to reduce inventory, some of it in response to slower demand, some of it really taking advantage of that improved performance. So we have targeted significant inventory reductions on both of those drivers.\nSteve Tusa: Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys. Appreciate all the details.\nMike Roman: Thanks, Steve.\nNick Gangestad: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, good morning.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: By the way great idea. Good morning. Great idea on the multi sales and please continue that post COVID. It's one of the information I have. I'm sure you want to. So looking at the April trends, and obviously a lot of companies are using April to anchor their expectations for 2Q and beyond and then using China as a sort of the lead indicator for what to expect elsewhere. So just two-part question here; one, would be can we use the mid-teens kind of placeholder for April as a guide particularly, or are you seeing sequential deterioration through April, which indicates that might get a little bit worse or get better? And then in China the strength that we've seen in April, which is obviously very encouraging. But how much of that is a sort of restock versus the obviously the severe declines we saw in February?\nMike Roman: Yeah. Nigel, maybe I'll take that. When you look at April, it's what it is. Our April trends to date. I led with outlook description, very fast changing lot of uncertainty. So to look beyond that trend part of the reason we're going to give monthly updates is it's just -- you can't project April into May or June or any further than what we are seeing right now. And I would -- so we'll update you as we go on that and give you better clarity month-by-month. When you look at China, we are seeing improvements. We're returning to growth in China. It's pretty broad-based across our portfolio. And for sure there's going to be some restocking. But we're seeing the economy start to show signs of recovery broadly. And it's not back to normal yet, but improving as we move through April.\nNigel Coe: Okay, great. Thanks, Mike. And then I think one for Nick. On the pricing 40 basis points in the quarter, are we confident that pricing will remain positive this year? Are we seeing any warning signs outside of Asia on pricing? And then can you just mark-to-market on where the raw material benefit is right now for FY 2020?\nNick Gangestad: Yeah, Nigel we started the year saying our price growth that we thought would be consistent with past trends and the 40 basis points that we saw in the first quarter is very much in line. If we look forward for the balance of this year, we're not seeing any kind of material change in what we're expecting for price growth for us. We think it will stay in this zone. In regards to raw materials Nigel we -- at the beginning of the year, we said that we expected raw materials to be between flat to up to a $0.10 tailwind to us. Right now if we look at it, it's going to be better than that. It's going to be a more significant tailwind. I'm not going to quantify it because things are dynamic enough, but we're seeing it go beyond that for benefit right now.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Thanks very much.\nNick Gangestad: Yeah. Thanks, Nigel.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe\u2026\nMike Roman: Hi, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Maybe just a first question please around the Health Care division. Maybe just help us understand within that what you've seen so far as the puts and takes from COVID? And it looks like underlying margins, excluding the acquisition impacts have been flattish in Q1 and Q4. So just wondering if and when health care sales recover alongside say oral care coming back, should we expect good incremental margins, or is it just that Health Care is at a higher level of reinvestment for the near or medium-term? Thank you.\nMike Roman: Yeah, Julian maybe I'll comment just on the business trends that we're seeing. So we saw Health Care grow by a little over 1% in first quarter. It was led by medical solutions and food safety. As we got to March, we saw a significant slowdown in oral care. And we also saw an impact from elective surgeries and a slowdown in Health Care in some of our medical solutions areas as well. So those are some of the trends we're seeing behind that overall growth number. Maybe I'll ask Nick to comment on the margin and your question around margins.\nNick Gangestad: Yes. Julian, of course, the biggest thing that we're seeing from margins in Health Care right now is from our acquisition of Acelity. And I think you will note in the appendix we're now providing EBITDA margins. We felt that would be helpful given the acquisition of Acelity to give one more level of information on that. In terms of the margins that we're seeing, it was absent Acelity pretty close to flat. And we've seen some mix impact in the first quarter as we've seen some parts of that business more impacted by COVID. And as Mike said, as we go into second quarter we will continue to see impacts on elective procedures that will be having an impact both on our growth and on our margin. As those recover and as we see people going back to their oral care professionals and electing to do elective procedures, we've also seen that have a positive impact on our margin going forward.\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. And then just my second question around the Safety and Industrial business. Clearly, some good tailwinds from all the work being done around respirators, but maybe focusing on the margin side very good margin uplift in the first quarter. Do you think we're now at a level in that business where given the cost-cutting actions some of the reorganization measures at 3M once we see the sales side improve in the second half or next year in industrial within that division we should see very good operating leverage there as well as good sales growth?\nNick Gangestad: Hey, Julian, I'll take that one. So we have been doing a number of actions within our Safety and Industrial business to be enhancing the margins. The things that we've been doing to make that a more efficient productive operation and part of what we were announcing on our January earnings call. When we look at what -- in our margins in particular in the first quarter that's been impacting that. But I think even more importantly we've had really good spending control going on in our Safety and Industrial business and that's been one of the big drivers of what you see in our first quarter margin. So yes going forward if there's -- as when we return to growth we will be seeing some benefits. But we also are seeing an impact right now of really good disciplined spending control in that business.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please proceed.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nNick Gangestad: Hey, Jeff.\nMike Roman: Good morning.\nJeff Sprague: Good morning. And just a little more granularity on some of the divisional stuff if I could. Excuse me. Personal safety was up looks like 7% in the quarter $60 million or so. I guess, I would have expected maybe it to be even stronger than that. I guess the 1.5% benefit you're talking about for Q2 I think is relative to total company sales. So it looks like you're looking for another kind of $120 million or so, kind of, lift on a year-over-year basis. Is that correct? And would that be kind of indicative of what your kind of current run rate production is for that business?\nBruce Jermeland: Hey, Jeff. This is Bruce. Organically, personal safety is up 14%. What you're seeing for all-in sales growth we had divestiture impact from our gas and flame detection divestiture which is impacting obviously total sales growth.\nJeff Sprague: All right. That's helpful. Thanks, Bruce. And then Nick just thinking about the sources and uses of cash and thanks for your color there what is your view on repo? Should we consider it's off the table for the balance of the year? Is this something that you'll be reconsidering as the year progresses? And is there going to be any requirement in pension as you get towards the end of this year looking into next?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. Jeff, as I mentioned earlier, we continue to look at a number of scenarios and manage accordingly for those. I think it would be fair to say that it's a dynamic situation. So I'm not going to put a timeline of when we would be possibly back in the market with a the share buyback program, but I think it's safe to say that we would want to have enough confidence in the future that we can resume guidance of what we're anticipating for our financial results before we would be resuming our share buyback program. In regards to the pension, we started the year with a well-funded pension. And we took what I will call a minor hit in our pension-funded status in the first quarter. And right now we don't foresee any changes in our capital allocation plans to our pension. We've been targeting around $200 million a year to our global defined benefit pension plans. And we don't see any required -- changes required in that pension funding going forward. So we don't -- for the foreseeable future at this point we're not seeing that change Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Right. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hope, you're all well.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Just maybe touching on China to start-off. It looks like the rebound in April has been pretty strong. Is there any end market-specific commentary that you can provide on what's really driving the strength in April?\nMike Roman: Yes. Joe, it -- when I said it was broad-based, we're seeing it across our businesses. Maybe I'd highlight, automotive is recovering. And remember, we had a big decline in Q1. So it's coming off of a low point, but starting to see some recovery there. Electronics has been leading the way. Semiconductor manufacturing has been strong demand for us. Consumer electronics off, but not as much. We're seeing Health Care and oral care recovering as we come into April. And then broader industrial and consumer as well. So it's really broad-based the market all the markets and businesses for us.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. And Mike, I may have missed this earlier, but as you're kind of thinking about the guidance and clearly, we don't have one now for the rest of the year. But like as you're kind of thinking about the trajectory for the U.S. and Europe, how much are you using China as like a guidepost from a growth perspective for the rest of the company?\nMike Roman: Yes. I would say, back to this fast-changing and lots of uncertainty, I think it's encouraging what we're seeing in China. But it's as good as April to date for us, because it's a pretty fast-changing dynamic globally. We did see as I mentioned trends in the second half of March in the Americas and EMEA down. And in some of the businesses that we highlighted that were weaker oral care elective procedures in our medical solutions, automotive general industrial, those are trends that we saw coming into the quarter. We'll have to see how it plays out and get a little further before we can give you a better projection.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. Good enough. Thanks guys.\nMike Roman: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please proceed.\nScott Davis: Good morning guys. \nMike Roman: Hey, Scott.\nNick Gangestad: Hi, Scott.\nScott Davis: Just comment here just says late April 75% plants and distribution centers fully or partially operational. What -- is there a sense -- how do you compare that to past cycles? Is that -- given that you'd probably be shutting some stuff down or shifts declined and stuff like that, is that materially different than what you saw in late 2008? Is it something you expect to ramp up meaningfully over the summer? Just a bit more color on that please.\nMike Roman: Scott, I think the way to think about it is look at our sales value of production. And we -- as I talked about some of the benefits of our enterprise operations the way we're operating that we're able to adjust more quickly and track with our demand and make sure our production plans are tracking with it. I remember, Q1 last year was one of the things we're working on adjusting to a slowdown in end markets. We are shortening our cycle times to do that. So our SVOP is tracking with what you saw in Q1. It's tracking with what we're seeing April year-to-date. That 75% number is kind of a view over a broader portfolio against end demand and just how we're managing the factories in the middle of the COVID crisis. So I think looking at SVOP is the way to look at it. And we can adapt quickly and we'll adjust as we see changes in the marketplace.\nScott Davis: Okay. Good, Mike. But can you help us understand, how that might compare to past recessions if you -- it doesn't have to be explicit, but if you have a sense of where you were in late 2008 was this 80%, 85%, or is this...\nMike Roman: I think the way I would probably think about it Scott is, I'd look at the magnitude of the slowdown and it's probably similar. There might be a little faster reaction to it and adoption to it now than even then. But we -- and living in 2009, we really managed our operations very quickly to in line with what we're seeing in the slowdown. And then back up again as the markets recovered even in the second half of the year. So I think it's similar, and it's one of the strengths of our model being vertically integrated with our manufacturing that we can do this. So I do give our teams credit for reducing cycle times, but the strategy and the 3M model, the strength is there in 2009 and it's here again in 2020.\nScott Davis: Okay. Super helpful. Thanks. Good luck guys and stay safe and we appreciate the monthly data too. So thank you.\nNick Gangestad: Thank you.\nMike Roman: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, guys. Hope, you're well. \nMike Roman: Hey, Andy.\nNick Gangestad: Thanks, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: So you mentioned \u2013 Mike, you mentioned the impact from respirators in the business. Just following up Jeff -- on Jeff's question a little bit 150 basis points. But given you're ramping to 2 billion respirators a year would seem like your impact could be more than 150 basis points by the end of the year, especially for the total PPE business. You do make surgical masks, gowns. You've got safety now. So could you give us some more color on the sizing of overall PPE? Any more color there would be helpful.\nMike Roman: Well I think the 150 basis points is -- that's Q2. That's the way we look at it in Q2. And we are adding capacity in the U.S. coming out of Q2. In late June, we'll get to 50 million respirators a month. That's up 40% from where we've been running coming into the quarter and where we expect to run for much of the quarter. And then our increased capacity that we plan to bring on later in the year and that likely to be a Q4 impact kind of on the business results. It will give us additional supply into very strong demand. So, we'll see additional growth impact from that. I don't have a number for you at this time. It's not clear the demand and how exactly the timing of when that production comes on, but you can use that 35 million to 50 million in the U.S. which the 35 million was part of 100 million worldwide. So, you can kind of back into maybe a 15% increase on the worldwide N95 piece of that come out of Q2.\nBruce Jermeland: And Andy for reference our disposable respirator business which is largely the N95, pre-crisis was about 2% of our global revenue, slightly less than that or around $600 million.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Got it. That's helpful guys. And then Mike I wanted to follow-up on the comments on electronics. I mean you mentioned the recovery in China. It's obviously more of a China-based business for you guys, but is that business being a little more resilient this cycle than expected? Can you give us some more color on what your -- to the extent you can on expectations moving forward between semicon? Obviously, you've got mobile devices in there. What are you seeing in that business?\nMike Roman: Yes. And Andy even as we came into the year, we were starting to feel better about electronics and it was really semiconductor manufacturing demand increasing. And that has held up. We're seeing that and that's part of that broader growth and return to growth in China. Consumer Electronics has been year-over-year a bit of a slowdown. We continue to see that. But overall, electronics is seeing a positive uptick as we come into Q2.\nAndy Kaplowitz: So just pushing you a little bit, is it up year-over-year at this point in April?\nMike Roman: April year-to-date -- or April month-to-date yes.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Okay. Thanks guys.\nNick Gangestad: Andy, I want to just give a little -- just go at one level down that where we are seeing our most significant growth in electronics in China is around fluids and semiconductor and less so on the consumer electronics side.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Got it. Thanks Nick.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nNicole DeBlase: Yes, thanks. Good morning.\nBruce Jermeland: Good morning, Nicole.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Nicole.\nNicole DeBlase: So, just following up on some of the questions around cost-cutting activities that you guys are doing this year, does that -- the 30% to 40% decremental margin assumption, I assume that also includes the carryover from payback on last year's restructuring actions. Is that correct?\nNick Gangestad: When we say the $30 million to $40 million, that's also including the year-on-year impact of taking those actions last year, so that's -- that is part of us being able to deliver a 30% to 40% decremental in the second quarter. Yes, that's part of it. On -- plus the extra $350 million to $400 million of cost savings we're initiating in this quarter.\nNicole DeBlase: Okay. Got it. Thanks Nick. And as my follow-up, if we think about the Health Care business, is there a way to quantify how much of the Health Care business is actually being impacted by elective surgeries not taking place? I'm just trying to get a sense of what part of the business has the potential to come back as COVID cases die down and elective surgeries return?\nMike Roman: Well medical solutions Nicole is our largest business in Health Care and that's being impacted by elective procedures. We're also seeing that in our Acelity business which is part of medical solutions. Oral care has been the more sharply impacted in demand slowdown as we come out of March. So, that's our second largest business in Health Care. So it's the bigger part of the impact I would say as we come into the quarter. But we would expect as elective procedures come back and demand there increases we'll see the benefit of that in that medical solutions business. And I -- so I think it's both is the answer and it's -- we expect it to recover as elective procedures come back.\nNicole DeBlase: Thanks. I'll pass it on.\nNick Gangestad: Thanks, Nicole.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning. Kind of a specific question here, but just want to understand the geography of where something might live looking at slide 22 when you talk about the sales by divisions. But it was interesting. I think in your prepared remarks you talked about respirator demand government industry health care I didn't hear consumer. Just wondering if we actually start to see some different behavior from consumers. Where that would show up? Does that actually hit the consumer segment through some type of health care, or would that go through a different segment and then ultimately end up in a consumer's home?\nMike Roman: Yes. And John, thank you for catching me on that because consumer is an important part of where we do supply respirator solutions. It reaches a broad range of customers. Some of them in -- through our DIY channel and small construction companies are strong customers for that. But we do expect to see a demand from consumers as we move forward as well. And that will show up in the results of our consumer business.\nBruce Jermeland: Yes. John, the biggest impact we're seeing is in our stationery and office business. Currently, as people have gone or work remotely from home on the negative side along with obviously schools shutting down.\nJohn Walsh: Yes. No, thank you. That's helpful. And then there's kind of a lot of excitement that we might see some manufacturing return to the U.S. Obviously you highlighted on PP&E. There's been some discussion around life sciences. Just curious, what you're hearing or seeing from some of your folks that are doing pharma filtration. I'm thinking about, if they're actually starting to get quotes or see an uptick activity for some of those solutions that you sell to that manufacturing front?\nMike Roman: Yes. And John, maybe I'll start there. We have seen some increased demand in our biopharma filtration. I highlighted as one of the stronger demand, stronger growth in Q1 and even as we come into April. When talking about manufacturing and having supply in the U.S., we are a company that as we took our model overseas, we never left the U.S. We continue to manufacture in the U.S. for the demand we have in this marketplace and then some. We have -- we take advantage of our strong base here and our technology in the U.S. and we do export as well. So our strategy -- and it's true around the world but especially true in the U.S., our strategy is to locate our manufacturing and supply chains close to customers to be able to serve them regionally and that's true of respirators and it's true of health care products and it's true of biopharma.\nJohn Walsh: Great. Thank you for the color.\nMike Roman: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.\nMike Roman: To close, I am incredibly proud of how our people are helping lead the response to COVID-19 and managing through this uncertain time. Going forward, we will continue to be guided by the three principles I laid out at the beginning of my remarks, protecting our employees; fighting the pandemic from all angles; and maintaining business continuity while positioning 3M to lead out of the slowdown and deliver for our employees' customers and shareholders. Thank you for joining us."}], "2022": [{"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 4, "year": 2021, "date": "2022-01-25 14:46:05", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, January 25, 2022. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland: Thank you and good morning, everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial and Transformation Officer. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments and then we will take your questions. Please note that today\u2019s earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Please turn to Slide 2. Before we begin, I would like to announce our next two investor events. On the morning of February 14, we will be having a Virtual Investor Meeting where we will be providing a near-term strategic update, along with our 2022 guidance. Also, please mark your calendars for our first quarter earnings conference call, which will take place on Tuesday, April 26. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today\u2019s conference call, we will be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note, throughout today\u2019s presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today\u2019s press release. Before I hand the call over to Mike, I would like to take a moment and highlight a couple of presentation changes we are making in 2022 to simplify our financial reporting and increase understanding of our performance. These changes are a result of discussions we have had with many of you over the last few years, along with recent benchmarking work that we have done. First, we recognize that dual credit reporting has presented some challenges, for example, having a clear understanding of the impact of disposable respirator performance over the past 2 years on our segment results, particularly Safety and Industrial and Healthcare. Therefore, we have decided to eliminate dual credit reporting and will no longer report dual credit within our business segments starting in Q1 2022. We will provide a Form 8-K ahead of our February 14 meeting with updated history for the past 3 years reflecting this change. And second, we will be providing organic sales change components in aggregate as opposed to reporting separate volume and price components. With this change, we will also be updating the descriptor to organic sales versus organic local currency sales. Please note, this change will be reflected in our 2021 Form 10-K filing. We remain committed to providing strong transparency of reporting our financial performance. And of course, we are always here to address your questions. With that, please turn to Slide 4 and I will now hand the call off to Mike. Mike?\nMike Roman: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. 3M delivered a solid performance in the fourth quarter, closing out a strong year as we focused on serving customers in a dynamic external environment. Our revenue in the quarter finished better than we expected across all businesses, including an increase in respirator demand due to the impact from the Omicron variant. Organic growth company-wide was 1% on top of 6% in last year\u2019s Q4, with earnings of $2.31 per share driven by a good December, strong execution and a lower than anticipated tax rate. I am pleased with how we effectively manage production operations to meet customer demand despite ongoing logistics and raw material challenges that are impacting many companies. While focusing on customers, we also saw good benefits from our actions to drive productivity, improve yields and control costs, which helped offset the margin impact of supply chain disruptions, inflation and COVID-19. In addition, our selling price actions continued to gain traction with a year-on-year increase of 2.6% in Q4 versus 1.4% in Q3. We expect this to be a tailwind for the full year in 2022. Overall, demand remains strong across our market leading businesses and we are continuing to prioritize growth investments in large attractive markets. We also took actions to strengthen our portfolio and advance our commitment to sustainability. I will highlight examples of our progress later in the call. In summary, we delivered a good finish to the year and are well positioned to drive growth in 2022. As Bruce noted, we will provide full year guidance along with strategic updates from our business leaders at our February 14 meeting. Monish will now take you through the details of the quarter. Monish?\nMonish Patolawala: Thanks, Mike and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 5. Looking back on the fourth quarter, the 3M team continued to manage through a challenging environment. As Mike noted, revenues for December were better than previously expected across all the businesses, including disposable respirators as the Omicron variant increased near-term demand. Though manufacturing, raw materials and logistic challenges persisted throughout the quarter, the 3M team executed well by driving operating rigor and managing costs while continuing to invest in the business. Turning to the fourth quarter financial results, sales were $8.6 billion, up 0.3% year-on-year or an increase of 1.3% on an organic local currency basis against our toughest quarterly comparison last year. Operating income was $1.6 billion with operating margins of 18.8% and earnings per share of $2.31. On this slide, you can see the components that impacted our operating margins and earnings per share performance as compared to Q4 last year. The biggest impact to fourth quarter results was the ongoing effects from the well-known global supply chain, raw materials and logistics challenges, which persisted throughout the fourth quarter. Our enterprise operations teams continue to work tirelessly through ever evolving changes in customer demand, while navigating these challenges to keep our factories running, serve our customers and protect the health and safety of our employees. We continue to experience significant productivity headwinds in our factories due to shorter production runs and more frequent production changeovers throughout the quarter as we focused on serving our customers. As forecasted at the start of last year, we also had higher year-on-year compensation and benefits costs. These impacts were partially offset through strong spending discipline along with benefits from restructuring and lower legal-related expenses versus last year\u2019s Q4. We also continue to prioritize investments in growth, productivity and sustainability to drive long-term performance and capitalize on trends in large, attractive markets, including automotive, home improvement, safety, healthcare and electronics. All-in, these impacts lowered operating margins by 2.4 percentage points and earnings per share by $0.33 year-on-year. Moving to price and raw materials, as expected, our selling price actions continue to gain traction as we went through the quarter. On a year-on-year perspective, Q4 selling prices increased 260 basis points as compared to 140 basis points in Q3 and 10 basis points in Q2. In dollar terms, higher year-on-year selling prices offset raw material and logistics cost inflation in Q4, which resulted in an increase in earnings of $0.03, however, remained a headwind of 20 basis points to operating margins. Next, foreign currency, net of hedging impacts, was a headwind of 10 basis points to margins and $0.04 per share year-on-year. There were three other non-operating items that impacted our year-on-year earnings per share performance. First, a reduction in other expenses resulted in a $0.10 earnings benefit. This included a $0.06 benefit from non-operating pension, which was similar to prior quarters. We also have been proactively managing our debt portfolio, including the early redemption of $1.5 billion, which helped drive a $0.04 benefit year-on-year from lower net interest expense. Second, a lower tax rate versus last year provided a $0.12 benefit to earnings per share. Our Q4 tax rate was benefited by geographic income mix and favorable adjustments related to impacts of U.S. international tax provisions. And for the full year, our tax rate was 17.8%. And finally, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 1% versus Q4 last year, increasing per share earnings by $0.02. Please turn to Slide 6 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. Fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow was $1.5 billion or down 30% year-on-year, with conversion of 110%. For the full year, adjusted free cash flow was $6 billion, with adjusted free cash flow conversion of 101%. The decline in our Q4 year-on-year free cash flow performance was driven primarily by lower non-cash legal and restructuring expenses versus Q4 last year, along with higher litigation-related payments and CapEx investments which was partially offset by improvements in working capital velocity. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $556 million, up $134 million year-on-year and $213 million sequentially as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. Looking at the full year, capital expenditures totaled $1.6 billion. During the quarter, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $848 million and share repurchases of $938 million. For the full year, we returned $5.6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Our strong fourth quarter cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to maintain a strong capital structure. We ended the year with $4.8 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand and reduced net debt by $1.2 billion or 8% versus year end 2020. As a result, we exited the year with net debt to EBITDA of 1.4x. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation capability, along with disciplined capital allocation continues to provide us the financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities and return cash to shareholders, while maintaining a strong capital structure. Please turn to Slide 7, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q4. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted an organic sales decline of 1.3% year-on-year in the fourth quarter. This result included a disposable respirator sales decline of approximately $110 million year-on-year, which negatively impacted Safety and Industrial\u2019s Q4 organic growth by nearly 4 percentage points. Our personal safety business declined mid-teens organically versus last year\u2019s 40% pandemic-driven comparison. Looking ahead, we anticipate that COVID-related disposable respirator demand will decline as we move through 2022. However, we remain prepared to respond to changes in demand as COVID-related impacts continue to evolve. Turning to the rest of Safety and Industrial, organic growth was led by a double-digit increase in closure and masking. In addition, the abrasives business was up high single-digits. Industrial adhesives and tapes and electrical markets were each up mid single-digits. Automotive aftermarket was flat, while roofing granules declined against a strong comparison from last year. Safety and Industrial\u2019s fourth quarter operating income was $543 million, down 22% versus last year. Operating margin was 17.7%, down 440 basis points versus Q4 last year. Year-on-year operating margin performance was impacted by a decline in sales volumes, higher raw materials, logistics and litigation-related costs, manufacturing productivity impacts, along with last year\u2019s gain on sale of property. Partially offsetting these impacts were selling price increases, strong spending discipline, net benefits from restructuring and a smaller increase to our respirator mask reserve. Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which declined slightly on an organic basis due to the continued impact of the semiconductor supply chain constraints. Our auto OEM business was down mid-teens organically year-on-year compared to the 13% decline in global car and light truck builds. As we mentioned last quarter, we experienced an increase in channel inventory levels with the tier suppliers in Q3 as auto OEM production volumes decelerated from 18.5 million builds in Q2 to 16.3 million in Q3. During the fourth quarter, OEM production volumes increased to 20.2 million builds or up over 20% sequentially. This sequential increase in build activity drove a reduction of channel inventory levels with the tier suppliers during the quarter, which negatively impacted Q4 organic growth for our automotive business by approximately 10 percentage points. For the full year, our auto OEM business was up low double-digits as compared to global car and light truck builds growth of 2%. Throughout the year, we continued our track record of success of winning with our customers and gaining penetration on new internal combustion and electric vehicle platforms. Our electronics-related business declined low single-digits organically, with declines across consumer electronics, particularly smartphones and TVs. These declines were partially offset by continued strong demand for our products and solutions in semiconductor and factory automation end markets. Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics, commercial solutions grew low double-digits, advanced material was up high single-digits, while transportation safety declined high single-digits. Fourth quarter operating income was $406 million, down 15% year-on-year. Operating margins were 17.6%, down 270 basis points year-on-year. Operating margins were impacted by higher raw materials and logistics costs, manufacturing productivity impacts, along with an increase in comp and benefits costs. These year-on-year headwinds were partially offset by increases in selling price, strong spending discipline and net benefits from restructuring actions. Turning to our Healthcare business, which posted a fourth quarter organic sales increase of 1.6%. This result included a nearly 4 percentage point drag from the year-on-year sales decline in disposable respirators. Our medical solutions business declined low single-digits organically, which included a 6 percentage point impact from the year-on-year sales decline in disposable respirators. Fourth quarter elective medical procedure volumes were approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels, which was similar to Q3 and last year\u2019s Q4. Sales in our oral care business grew low single-digits year-on-year as patient visits continue to be near pre-COVID levels. The separation and purification business increased high single-digits year-on-year, with sustained demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccines and therapeutics. Health Information Systems grew mid single-digits, driven by strong growth in revenue cycle management and clinician solutions. And finally, food safety increased high single-digits despite continued COVID-related impacts at the global hospitality industry. In December, we announced the planned separation of this business, which will be combined with Neogen. As disclosed in the December press release, we expect the transaction to close by the end of Q3 of this year. Healthcare\u2019s fourth quarter operating income was $536 million, down 2% year-on-year. Operating margins were 23.6%, down 50 basis points. Year-on-year, operating margins were negatively impacted by raw materials and logistics costs, manufacturing productivity, compensation and benefits costs and food safety deal-related costs. These impacts were partially offset by benefits from leverage on sales growth, strong spending discipline and restructuring actions. For the quarter and full year, Healthcare\u2019s adjusted EBITDA margins were strong, coming in at nearly 31%. Lastly, our consumer business finished out the year strong, with organic growth of 4.9% year-on-year on top of last year\u2019s 10% comparison. Our home improvement business continued to perform well, up low single-digits on top of last year\u2019s strong double-digit comp. This business continued to deliver strong growth with our home improvement retail customers in our category leading Filtrete, Command and Scotch-Blue brands. Stationery and office, along with the consumer health and safety business, each grew low double-digits organically in Q4 as both of these businesses continue to lap last year\u2019s COVID-related comparisons. The holiday season demand drove strong growth for our Scotch branded products during the quarter. We also posted strong growth in Post-it branded products despite workplace reopenings being pushed out due to the resurgence of COVID cases. And finally, our Home Care business was up low single-digits versus last year\u2019s strong COVID-driven comparison. During the quarter, we took a small portfolio action to divest our flow care business in Europe, which is expected to close in Q1. Consumer\u2019s operating income was $316 million, flat compared to last year. Operating margins were 21.4%, down 100 basis points year-on-year. Operating margins were impacted by higher raw materials, logistics and outsourced hard goods manufacturing costs, manufacturing productivity impacts, along with increased compensation and benefit costs. These impacts were partially offset by leverage on sales growth, which included good price performance, strong spending discipline and net benefits from restructuring actions. That concludes my remarks for the fourth quarter. Before I turn it back over to Mike to recap the year, I would like to make a few comments reflecting on our operating performance this past year. The macro environment in 2021 was defined by strong, but fluid end markets, semiconductor constraints, supply chain and logistics challenges, along with ever evolving impacts from COVID-19, particularly on the global healthcare industry. These dynamics were further compounded by winter storm Uri in mid-February, which led to significant disruptions to raw material supply and logistics availability, which further disrupted global supply chains. All of these factors collectively helped contribute to broad-based and accelerating inflationary pressures throughout the year. Against this backdrop, the 3M team kept a relentless focus on serving customers, ensured continuity of raw material supply, managed ever changing manufacturing production plans, navigated logistic constraints and delivered strong full year organic growth of 9%, with all business segments posting high single-digit growth. We also worked hard to raise selling prices, control spending and drive improvements in operating rigor through daily management, leveraging data and data analytics, while continuing to execute on our restructuring actions. These actions, combined with strong organic growth, helped to deliver full year operating margins of 20.8% or down 50 basis points year-on-year on an adjusted basis. This result included an 80 basis point headwind from raw materials and logistics inflation net of selling price actions, along with increased spending to advance our sustainability efforts and higher legal-related expenses. In addition, we continue to focus on working capital improvement, which helped contribute to another year of robust adjusted free cash flow coming in at $6 billion. I want to thank the 3M employees for delivering for our customers and shareholders in a very uncertain and fluid environment. I also want to take a moment to personally thank our customers and suppliers for putting their trust and confidence in us and for maintaining strong and close partnerships that helped us navigate the challenges of the past year. We made good progress in 2021 and are well positioned for 2022. And in the spirit of continuous improvement, there is always more we can do and will do. With that, please turn to Slide 8. And I will turn it back over to Mike for his recap of 2021.\nMike Roman: Thank you, Monish. As I look back at 2021, I am proud of our team and our performance. Our results demonstrated the strength of the 3M model and our investments in growth, productivity and sustainability advanced our company. In the face of an uncertain environment, we delivered strong organic growth of 9%, with strength across all business groups, along with margins of 21%. This drove a 14% increase in adjusted earnings per share. These results exceeded our original guidance that we communicated in January of 2021 and recent updates to that guidance. We generated robust free cash flow of $6 billion with an adjusted conversion rate of 101%, enabling us to invest in the business, reduce net debt by $1 billion and return significant cash to shareholders. All in, 3M returned $5.6 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and 2021 marked our 63rd consecutive year of dividend increases. We continue to help the world respond to COVID-19 with 2.3 billion respirators distributed last year for a total of 4.3 billion since the onset of the pandemic, while engaging with governments on how to prepare for future emergencies. We stepped up our commitments to ESG, including sustainability as we made progress on new goals to achieve carbon neutrality, reduce water use, improve water quality and reduce plastics. As part of our ongoing sustainability commitments, we proactively manage PFAS and deploy capital to make our factories and communities stronger and more sustainable. As one example, we are on track to complete a new water filtration system in Cordova, Illinois by the end of 2022. In Zwijndrecht, Belgium, we installed and activated a treatment system last month to reduce PFAS discharges by up to 90%. This is part of a \u20ac125 million commitment to improve water quality and support the local community. As disclosed in our 8-K in November, we continue to work with local authorities related to a safety measure that shut down certain operations in Zwijndrecht. We are also appealing and discussing with local authorities a new change to our wastewater discharge permit that if implemented, could have a material impact and potentially interrupt production at the entire site, impacting customers and the supply of material to other 3M factories. We are actively working to address current and future potential impacts, and we will update you as appropriate. With respect to litigation, we reached settlements last year in certain PFAS cases and continue to vigorously defend ourselves on combat arms. As always, we encourage you to read our SEC filings for updates on these matters. As we advance our ESG priorities, we also continue to take actions to improve diversity, equity and inclusion. This includes multiple programs to make STEM education more available to underrepresented groups and achieve our goal to deliver 5 million learning experiences. Our businesses have also made commitments. Safety and Industrial, for example, is focusing on access to skilled trades, and we are increasing transparency through an annual diversity, equity and inclusion report. At the same time, we are advancing our strategic priorities for long-term growth and value creation. We are innovating faster and differently, including new ways to collaborate with customers and partners virtually, while investing $3.6 billion in the combination of R&D and CapEx to strengthen 3M for the future. To make the most of long-term growth opportunities, we also continue to prioritize investments in large, fast-growing areas like automotive, home improvement, safety, healthcare and electronics. In 2021, for example, our automotive electrification platform grew 30% organically, and our biopharma business grew 26%. Our home improvement business grew 12% on top of 13% growth in 2020, driven by iconic brands, including our Command damage-free hanging solutions and Filtrete home filtration products. To accelerate our ability to meet increasing demand for Command and Filtrete, last week, we announced a nearly $500 million investment to expand our operations in Clinton, Tennessee, adding nearly 600 manufacturing jobs by 2025. We look forward to sharing more about how we are capitalizing on growth trends and winning in these markets at our February meeting. Last year, we also continued to reposition our portfolio to maximize value across the enterprise, including an agreement to divest and combine our food safety business with Neogen, creating a global leader that is well positioned to capture long-term profitable growth. We continue to make progress in transforming 3M, accelerating our digital capabilities and expanding our use of data and analytics to better serve customers and improve our operational agility and efficiency. This includes the ongoing deployment of our ERP system, which went live in Japan in Q4 and also moving more than 60% of our enterprise applications and global data center infrastructure to the cloud, while streamlining our business group-led operating model. To help our people be at their best, we also introduced new employee work models rooted in flexibility and trust, along with investments to support their health and well-being. As we enter 2022, I\u2019m confident we will continue to grow our businesses, improve our operational performance and find new ways to apply science to improve lives, delivering for our customers, shareholders and all stakeholders who have placed their trust in us. We are building a stronger 3M, and I want to thank our 95,000 employees for their contributions, including the 50,000 people in our factories who continue to show up day in and day out to make a difference. That wraps up our prepared remarks, and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. I wasn\u2019t expecting the first question. Good morning. Thanks for that. So as much upside to your early December guidance, Monish, you called out a number of factors, but you didn\u2019t call out N95, which given all the talk we\u2019ve got from the federal government about free masks and the new guidance and I\u2019m just curious what you\u2019re seeing from that side of the business given all the commentary we\u2019ve seen?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So Nigel, I would say when we gave you the guidance in December, at that time, we had not seen the pickup of N95s. And one of the factors that made us deliver better than what we thought in December was the pickup of the respirator business. We came in $40 million better than what we had originally predicted. So we have seen that pickup. But I would still say it\u2019s volatile. We will see how this plays itself out. We are pleased with the partnership that we have with the federal government right now as regards to this. We\u2019ve had a lot of dialogue with them. And as things evolve, we will keep you posted.\nNigel Coe: Okay. And then just \u2013 I know you\u2019re going to give guidance on Feb 14. But just curious, just given the lots of moving parts of the margin line, just wondering how we think about the takeoff point into 2022, specifically 1Q \u201822. Normal seasonality would have you up slightly from 4Q. Just wondering how you think about that. And have we seen the peak of the inflation curve at this point?\nMonish Patolawala: Have we seen the peak, I\u2019m sorry, of what?\nMike Roman: Inflation.\nNigel Coe: Of inflation curve.\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So I\u2019ll start with that first comment, Nigel. And that\u2019s an item that we constantly keep watching and debating. As you know, we\u2019ve tried to fine-tune our analysis as much as we can on inflation. So what we saw exiting December was the pace of inflation slowed down versus the prior months. It\u2019s still inflationary, but we saw the pace slow down. And I think that\u2019s a positive. But again, it will depend on how winter plays itself out, it depends on logistics, etcetera, and whether the ports get uncongested. Just on data points and your other points on margin, etcetera, things to keep in mind as you get into 1Q \u201822. First of all, from an inflation perspective, you\u2019re going to find not just us, but most companies have the highest \u2013 the toughest comp because if you remember, in the first quarter of last \u2013 of \u201821, there wasn\u2019t as much inflation. We started seeing it in March and then it accelerated in April onwards. So I would factor that one in first. The second, I would say, is COVID uncertainty. You brought up the respirator demand, but there are other impacts also depending on what happens with COVID, labor shortages that we are seeing from our customers. We are seeing it in our own factories. Our vendors, I\u2019m sure, are facing it, too. So that\u2019s something we will have to watch. The third one is we are going to continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. So I would say that\u2019s an area as we continue to see it, we\u2019re going to keep investing, especially in the areas Mike has already talked about. I would say we continue to see a strong market. We saw it in the fourth quarter. We are seeing it right now. And I think 2022 will continue to remain a strong market. The team has done a marvelous job in driving price. Price has gone up from 0.1% to 1.4% to 2.6%. Mike had talked about that also in his opening remarks that we see that to be a tailwind. Team has done a good job on executing on restructuring so there is approximately $70 million of carryover of restructuring benefits for the year. Auto and electric growth, right now, sequentially from a build rate is showing flat for the year of 2022. It\u2019s a 9% increase. I think the chip shortage and where that ends up will have an impact on the auto business. Healthcare elective procedures came in at 90%. There are predictions that says they should be at 100% by Q4 2022. From our end, we are going to continue driving operating rigor. We\u2019re going to continue to drive margin expansion, as we have said before. We will also have to watch litigation costs and see where that goes with all the cases that are on. And then Mike mentioned about Zwijndrecht, and we\u2019re working with the authorities in Belgium for our factory, and we will have to see the impact and when we can start up production in some of those areas that are currently shut down. So all that put together, I would say, again, we are well positioned, and I know it\u2019s a long answer to your question, Nigel, but I just wanted to give you a full framework. We are well positioned for 2022. We closed Q4 pretty well, and we hope to continue that momentum into 2022.\nNigel Coe: Great. Thanks for the details. I will leave there. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. You may proceed with your question.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nMonish Patolawala: Good morning.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Good morning. A couple here from me. First, just \u2013 I was wondering if you could level set us actually now on the actual size of the respirator business. I think we were $600 million pre-COVID. I feel like we\u2019re in the $1.5 billion to $2 billion range. But could you put a finer point on where we stand at the end of 2021?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So Jeff, it\u2019s $1.5 billion is what we did in 2021. It was $600 million in \u201819, $1.4 billion in 2020 and $1.5 billion in 2021. If you look at it quarter over \u2013 sequentially, we were down and we were also down $110 million versus Q4 of 2020. We believe that the peak was Q1 of 2021. And then depending on how it goes, but we believe in 2022, disposable respirator demand is going to be lower than what we had in 2021.\nJeff Sprague: I know you\u2019re going to reserve your guidance for next month, but you did essentially get the price cost neutrality in the quarter, right, a little negative on margins, a little positive on EPS. Is it your view that, that gets better over the course of the year? And as you think about kind of carryover price, I understand there is a ton of variables in that. But directionally, I just wonder if you could give us your preliminary thoughts on how that tracks for the year.\nMonish Patolawala: Yes, Jeff, I think we are working through that. But just as Mike mentioned, pricing will continue to remain a tailwind for 2022. Inflation, I think we will have to watch how the different factors play out back to raw material logistics. I think what you\u2019re going to see is you\u2019re going to see some of your primary feedstocks start stabilizing, which we saw in December. But you are going to see specialty feedstock starting to get more expensive. We are seeing inflation has gone downstream now. So you\u2019re seeing it in much more places than you had seen it before. I think what\u2019s also going to impact inflation is what happens with the labor pool and what goes on there. And then as long as the ports can start getting uncongested, I think you\u2019re going to see logistics costs come down. If commercial airline capacity comes back in, you\u2019re going to start seeing air freight start coming down. So we are watching all of that. I would say first half in talking to people, our own analysis, etcetera, I think the first half is going to be tougher than the second half of 2022 when it comes to inflation. First half part of it is, as I mentioned, we are still seeing sequential increases, but slower. So that\u2019s good. But you\u2019re going to start facing last year\u2019s comp when it comes to inflation. And I think that\u2019s going to impact us. So I think we are well positioned and as I\u2019ve told you before, the team has gone after price. We are managing a price raw equation as best we can, and we\u2019re prepared to act as the situation evolves.\nJeff Sprague: And then just lastly for me, if I could. Mike, I think you made a comment about the dramatically reducing PFAS discharges. Perhaps this is my bad, but I didn\u2019t know you were still discharging PFAS in places. Is this just at a single location? Or is this still an issue that you\u2019re addressing in multiple locations?\nMike Roman: Yes, Jeff, this was part of our \u2013 really following through on what we committed to do and we announced back at the beginning of 2021 to make an investment in reducing the water use in our factories, improving the water quality of our largest facilities. And part of that is this discharge \u2013 controlling discharges, reducing that as part of that investment. And that includes what \u2013 PFAS is a broad category of chemistries. We\u2019ve talked about how we exited now almost 2 decades ago, the PFOA, PFOS chemistries, which are a part of a lot of the discussions in PFAS, but there are other PFAS chemistries that are used in chemical manufacturing and generally in some of our sites. And that was the focus. I mean, we\u2019re always in compliance with the regulations that are on our plants. This is a chance to step forward and do even more and reduce further. And that was what I talked about with Zwijndrecht. This is reducing further below our requirements at the time, our additional \u2013 improving the water quality even further.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. You may proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Okay. Good morning, everybody.\nMonish Patolawala: Hi, Scott.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Davis: Just wanted to follow-up on Jeff\u2019s question on price a little bit, are prices up again in January, meaning did you have a January 1 price increase or did you implement your last big price increase in 4Q?\nMonish Patolawala: So we\u2019ve implemented big price increases in 4Q. But again, Scott, as we have said, a lot of these were pretty coordinated across different geographies, different markets. So, to the extent we see the need that we have to do in 1Q, we will do the same on 2022, we will do the same.\nScott Davis: Okay. Fair enough. And then this Belgium situation, can you give us a little bit of color on how material \u2013 I mean, you\u2019ve had a couple \u2013 couple of your disclosure \u2013 previous disclosure said you can\u2019t measure the materiality, but you\u2019ve had a couple of months now. I mean, can you supply out of other factories and meet demand? How disruptive is this? And should we \u2013 I mean it\u2019s a fancy way of saying, should we build this into our models and some sort of a headwind in 2022? Or do you feel like you\u2019re going to have some remediation here?\nMike Roman: Yes, Scott, back to the comments I made in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re in the middle of this right now. We continue to work with the local authorities. We\u2019re appealing and discussing the change in our wastewater discharge permit there. It could have a material impact and potentially in production at the site. So that\u2019s something we wanted to be clear on. It\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re in the middle of it, and I don\u2019t really want to speculate at this point on what it will ultimately mean. This is a priority for us. We have our best people working on it, actively working the problem, and we will update as appropriate as we go forward here as we work through it.\nScott Davis: Okay. Good luck, Mike. Thank you.\nMike Roman: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nMonish Patolawala: Hi, Joe.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: So I know we will get more details in mid-February. But I guess maybe just kind of thinking about the margin trajectory for both Safety and Industrial and for Transportation and Electronics both of those segments have been hit pretty hard the last couple of quarters. And I\u2019m just curious, as you kind of think through the beginning part of 2022, I mean, should we continue to expect the same type of headwinds or are there certain things that you would call out, perhaps the litigation costs not recurring into 2022 that could be potential tailwinds to margins in the early part of the year?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes, Joe, as you said, we will give you more guidance as we go through. But just to answer your question more specifically, I would say a couple of things, and I\u2019ve said that before, too, volume has the biggest impact for us on a margin, whether it\u2019s SI BGT, BG healthcare or CBG. I think we will have to see what 1Q volume turns out to be, what headwinds we have or tailwinds. When you think about just the trends that those two businesses are seeing, overall GDP and IPI is going to be positive for 2022. I think it\u2019s volatile in the first quarter and the second quarter and what that turns out. So that will determine industrial activity. On an auto build, it is flat to down sequentially, so \u2013 and it\u2019s flat to down on a year-over-year basis, too. So that will have an impact on TEBG, that, of course, then we will have to see smartphone shipments. So that\u2019s the macroeconomic environment. On our own, you\u2019ve seen the team\u2019s done a good job of raising price. So we have seen price go up sequentially through the quarter. And so you should see that price hold or get better. Inflation is another area that, again, I think we will face a very tough comp from last year. We had very little inflation in the first quarter of last year. So you are \u2013 on a year-over-year basis, Joe, going to face that comp. And then the third piece is on litigation. As we have told you we are actively working and defending ourselves and to combat our cases. It\u2019s a little \u2013 right now, I don\u2019t know where that goes, and we will keep doing what\u2019s right to keep defending ourselves and see where those expenses land. So I think this is the best I can give you at this moment, a little bit of macroeconomic, some of our stuff. And then internally, the last piece before I turn it back to you for another question, is from driving supply chain efficiency, driving our factories, improving rigor, that\u2019s just something we\u2019re going to keep doing. We have done it. We will keep doing it. So that should help. And then supply chain availability or the manufacturing productivity impacts that we\u2019ve had in the last two quarters, which has impacted SIBG and TEBG a lot, we will have to see how the material flows. Again, December turned out to be better and you saw that come through from a leverage perspective, which goes back to the comment that volumes as the best leverage.\nJoe Ritchie: That\u2019s super helpful, thank you, Monish. And then just maybe my quick follow-on, just you mentioned the combat arms and clearly PFAS being just an important part of the story here for investors. I\u2019m just curious, just from a timeline perspective, as you think about 2022, are there certain dates that we should be thinking about or penciling in, just to be paying close attention to any type of progress or resolution on either of those two items?\nMike Roman: Yes, Joe, we try to keep you updated even in these calls on what\u2019s coming next. And we don\u2019t have any specific trials coming up in PFAS. The next one is related to the MDL, which we\u2019re expecting in 2023. There is, as you know, EPA is working on a management plan and there is a strategic road map through the President Biden\u2019s administration. So we\u2019re \u2013 we will be watching that and updating you as we learn more around that. Related to combat arms, just frame this up. We have great respect for the brave men and women of the military protectors around the world. And we have a long partnership here. We\u2019ve been providing products and continue to provide products in the matter with the combat arms, we believe our product was safe and effective in its use, and we\u2019re vigorously defending ourselves. And we\u2019ve been working through these bellwether trials. We\u2019ve had 10 trials so far, five of those were in our favor. 8 actually were dismissed in addition to the 10 trials we\u2019ve had, and we\u2019re in the middle of those bellwether. So there is another six bellwethers planned for 2022. And we will update you as we go through that and we will update you as appropriate.\nJoe Ritchie: Great. Thank you, both.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Thanks very much. Maybe the first question on sort of cash flow and capital deployment, so, cash flow was down double-digits in Q4 and the full year and understood the sort of abnormal base in 2020. But how should we think about cash flow for this year? How quickly do we get sort of working capital under control? And also in terms of the sort of disbursement of cash, you paid out around 90% or 95% of free cash flow last year to shareholders. Do we expect sort of similar type approach in \u201822?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So, I will start, Julian, with just reminding you, from a capital allocation perspective, and I will just \u2013 for everyone\u2019s benefit, our first is always organic growth where we believe we will get the best return. You saw us putting in $1.6 billion from a CapEx perspective in 2021. For 2022 and beyond, we are going to continue to invest in growth. You have seen us make the big announcement in Clinton. It\u2019s $0.5 billion of investment that we are going to put over the next couple of years. We also have given you our goal on sustainability where we plan to spend $1 billion, part of it CapEx, OpEx, which is front-end loaded. Third, as we had talked about on CapEx, we had mentioned during our earnings call as well as other updates throughout the quarter, our plan was to spend $1.8 billion to $2 billion. We were not able to, unfortunately, because of raw material and labor availability. So, to the extent that we have good programs out there, we are going to keep doing that. So, that\u2019s organic growth. Second is, from a dividend perspective, we know it\u2019s an important piece for our shareholders. We are going to continue to do that. Mike mentioned it was the 63rd year in 2021 that we increased dividend. So, we will see where 2022 goes with that. Third is M&A and portfolio. We have an active pipeline, and we are always looking for good businesses that can help us \u2013 that we can add value as well as the business that we acquire can add value to 3M and the shareholders. And then the last piece is share buyback, which we have done. And we stepped up in Q4, and we had mentioned that during our earnings call as well, I think \u2013 I am sorry, and certain updates in the quarter, where we said the stock was attractive, and we stepped into it, and that\u2019s what we did in Q4. Talking specifically about working capital, working capital continues to remain a big priority for us, doing data and data analytics. And if you actually see and do the math, Julian, and you do cash conversion cycle in Q4 of 2020 versus Q4 of 2021, you are actually going to see that the velocity of working capital went up. The revenue was higher in total for 2021. So therefore, you do see the drag on working capital. And at the same time, if you further split working capital up inventory is where with all the supply chain challenges, that\u2019s an area that the team has done a nice job of managing the inventory, but that\u2019s where you have much more opportunity as supply stabilizes. So, that\u2019s an area I would say we are going to continue driving cash. There is a lot of opportunity to keep giving strong cash. We generated $6 billion and then from a net debt-to-EBITDA basis, we are down to 1.4 versus when I started 18 months ago, we were at close to 2.3, 2.4. So, the team has done a really nice job of driving cash and working capital is a big piece of it.\nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just as a follow-up, it feels a long time ago, but I suppose it was fairly recent, the food safety divestment as sort of broad perspective on the portfolio. The fact that it was one of the 12 priority growth platforms at the company and is still being divested, does that tell us at least on the outside, one could interpret that as meaning that there is a much broader sort of remit around potential divestments at 3M, if you are even willing to sell a priority growth business? Is that a sort of reasonable interpretation?\nMike Roman: Yes, Julian, I would say, first, it reinforces what we have been talking about. Our portfolio strategy is actively continuously evaluating our portfolio. We do that to make decisions on where we invest organically, more attractive markets that can leverage 3M\u2019s capabilities, fundamental strengths. We look at acquisitions that can complement what we do organically and when integrated into 3M, give us attractive markets that can add value in greater than some of the parts of the two businesses. We also are looking how to maximize value all the time. And that is everything from managing our businesses differently to up to and including divestitures. And we have done a number of those over time where we saw better owners or greater value to be really achieved through the divestiture. And sometimes that\u2019s strengthening the business so they can deliver greater value to customers. It\u2019s always focused on how can we deliver greater value creation through the business, including returns to our shareholders. And so when you look at food safety, while it was an organic priority for us because it had strong growth opportunities and can leverage some of the capabilities of 3M, we also saw a path to greater value, a combination with Neogen, where you can strengthen the two businesses by putting them together and really create greater value for customers and for shareholders. So, it\u2019s very consistent with what \u2013 how we look at our portfolio management, and I think it\u2019s an outcome of a continuous process. And we are going to continue to actively manage our portfolio.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho Securities. You may proceed with your question.\nBrett Linzey: Thanks and good morning.\nMike Roman: Good morning Brett.\nBrett Linzey: I wanted to come back to the margin bridge. You guys called out the manufacturing inefficiencies that occurred in Q4 related to the shorter production runs, more production changeovers, etcetera. Are you able to isolate in size, in dollars or margins? How large of a headwind that was in Q4 on a full year basis in \u201821?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes, Brett, it\u2019s really hard to do it that way because it has a compounding effect. So, unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to isolate the number. In total, when we put the manufacturing productivity together, including the spend, you can see it\u2019s $0.33 negative in total, which included three things. One is lower volume, which has an impact first on just generally the plans. Second is the material productivity. The third is the wage inflation and the prior headwinds that we had talked about when it comes to variable compensation, and then we continued to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability.\nBrett Linzey: Yes. It makes sense and understandably inflation, logistics pressures continue, but I am just trying to get a sense, do those resolve early in Q1 as some of the demand pulse gets better here?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So, I think we are watching it, Brett. I think our view is we are going to see a volatile environment in the first half. Things should get better in the second half. But I would not expect a big snap back on stability of supply in 1Q of 2022.\nBrett Linzey: Right. Okay. And just wanted to come back to the comment on prioritizing investments for this year, I think last year, R&D as a percent of sales was at the lower end of where it\u2019s been historically. Does the R&D number need to move higher in \u201822, or can you keep it at the same level and just allocate those dollars more effectively?\nMike Roman: Brett, it\u2019s really something we focus on, prioritizing our investments. We talk about prioritizing in growth, productivity and sustainability as we have come through the pandemic, as we came through 2021 accelerating those investments where we saw the best opportunity. That\u2019s R&D, that\u2019s CapEx, that\u2019s commercial investments. Very big focus on R&D, as you would expect. It\u2019s where we drive our innovation with that investment in R&D. And so the overall percent of sales that you see at an enterprise level, it wouldn\u2019t surprise you that there are parts of our portfolio that are much higher than that and others that are lower than average. And we are prioritizing that in some of the areas that I talked about in my prepared remarks. We see attractive investments. So, we actually are increasing R&D in some areas and managing it overall pretty well in line with where we have come from. But there is a lot going on underneath that. It\u2019s really that prioritization where we are targeting stepping up our investments in those most attractive areas. And it\u2019s true for CapEx as well.\nBrett Linzey: Got it. Makes sense. Best of luck.\nMike Roman: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nMike Roman: Hi Deane.\nDeane Dray: Just a couple clarifications. Going back to the opening Q&A and Nigel\u2019s question on December coming in better, you did clarify that masks were better by $40 million. What were the other businesses that did better or product lines that did better in December?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So, $40 million was for the whole quarter, Deane, just to clarify that. December definitely had a pickup there. Consumer came in strong and then healthcare came in strong. So, that\u2019s the other two I would call out in December.\nDeane Dray: Got it. And then when Bruce made two topics that are going to change in reporting going forward, could you just clarify the second one? It sounded like you were not going to report segment, volume and price separately? Just clarify what the thinking is there and what will we see going forward?\nBruce Jermeland: Yes, Deane, this is Bruce. We have never reported separate segment volume and price by the segments. We have at the total enterprise level and the geography level. We are no longer going to report separate volume and price going forward. And it\u2019s due to a lot of the benchmarking work we have done. Also, the one conversation piece we have had throughout the year relative to prices, what\u2019s showing up in price is what gets realized in the quarter. And it\u2019s not a true reflection of the actions we are taking in the end market. So, I think it created a lot of confusion relative to 3M taking price or not. Yes, we are taking price, but it really is only showing up relative to what actually got realized in a particular period. So, organic growth is our number one objective, and that\u2019s what we are going to report going forward.\nDeane Dray: So, Slide 12 in the appendix where you break out organic volume by region and price, does that go away?\nBruce Jermeland: Yes. So, yes, if you recall, Deane, when we move to our new business group-led business model, we are running global businesses now. We no longer have a separate international structure. So \u2013 and that\u2019s how we are operating the business driving growth around the world no matter where it\u2019s at.\nDeane Dray: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. You may proceed with your question.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning guys.\nMike Roman: Hi Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Can you give us a little more color into what you are seeing in electronics? I think you mentioned in Q4 is down still and it tends to be quite volatile for you. So, without giving a specific outlook for \u201822, have you seen any improvement in semiconductor availability is starting to help that business? How are inventories in the channel? At what point do your businesses such as data center-focused products, auto electrification start to become meaningful enough to better support that business?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So, I would say, Andy, and I will start with your first thing on chips. So, production did go up in auto in December versus what was originally planned. For the year, auto ended at plus 2 for the quarter, it ended at minus 13. And I think it came in a little better than what was the original forecast. So, it did get a little better there. I think what we are seeing is it\u2019s still volatile from a supply chain perspective. And our view is that you are going to see that volatility in the first half of 2022. When you take consumer electronics, consumer electronics was down on a year-over-year basis. It\u2019s projected to be up from \u201821 to \u201822 for the year, and we will have to see when launches happen, etcetera. And then on the fluids or that\u2019s \u2013 the semiconductor of our business, the business has grown very well. We continue to perform very well. We continue to deliver value for our customers. And in 2022, you should expect us to continue doing the same.\nAndy Kaplowitz: That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe a little more color on what you are seeing regionally, obviously, you have tougher comparisons in China as you go into next \u2013 into \u201822, there is some geopolitical risk out there. So, any sort of trends that you are seeing or want to highlight as we are going into \u201822 regionally?\nMike Roman: Yes. Andy, I would take you to GDP and IPI, I think you \u2013 there is an outlook for 2022 that says we are going to see a pretty good backdrop globally, led by probably U.S. and Asia in that regard and the stronger areas, IPI, GDP, both. If you look \u2013 if you go into China, in particular, we saw growth in 2021. We were up low-single digits in Q4, which was similar to the overall China macro. For the whole year, we were up low-double digits, which was above the macro for China. So, continue to see growth opportunities there. Our growth was led by our healthcare business. We saw growth in our consumer business. Both of those were up low teens. Our industrial business was up low-single digits in the quarter. And where we saw some weakness was in transportation and electronics, really back to the semiconductor chip challenges, some of the supply chain challenges. Those were impacting that in China as well. So, I paint that picture, so you can kind of see we have a focus on growing at or above the macro in China as well. And the outlook is to be positive. And we are prioritizing, like everywhere else, where we see the trends. And some of those areas in electronics have continued to stay strong, while overall consumer electronics challenged with the chip shortage. We saw strength in semiconductor fabrication, factory automation. So, they are \u2013 we see those as areas that we are well positioned as we come into 2022 as well.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Appreciate it guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan Securities. You may proceed with your question.\nStephen Tusa: Hi guys. Good morning.\nMike Roman: Good morning Steve.\nStephen Tusa: Just a question on \u2013 I know, Monish, you have kind of taken on this, I guess an additional title of kind of Transformation Officer. Many times, that means there is going to be some kind of major portfolio moves. What is this kind of transformation title mean from that perspective? Is it really looking at kind of the structure of the company, or is it more about improving processes and more of an operating?\nMike Roman: Yes, Steve, I am interested in Monish\u2019s answer as well, but I thought I would just frame it up. He is leading transformation, which is really taking responsibility for leading our IT and digital strategy, and overall transformation includes what we call business transformation. Monish has been driving some of these efforts from his role as CFO, and he led transformation his prior employer as well. He brings that operating rigor to it. So, when we recently hired a new Chief Information and Digital Officer that reports to Monish as part of that. So, if you think about it, it\u2019s really that business transformation we have talked about for a number of years, focused on deploying new digital capabilities, digital strategy broadly, digital enterprise capabilities like our ERP and our move to the cloud, also digital operations and even how we are digitizing for our customers. And so it\u2019s really bringing his leadership to that. So, Monish can give you his perspective on it.\nMonish Patolawala: Listen, I don\u2019t have much to add, Steve, other than the fact that when we look at the opportunity at 3M, whether it\u2019s growth at or by macro, margin expansion and strong cash. Underneath that, you can tuck in portfolio. Digital is a big opportunity for us, whether it\u2019s leveraging data and data analytics. And I just view my job as to enable the teams to achieve what 3M can. So, I am excited and we have a great set of people working on this.\nStephen Tusa: Right. And then I think you guys mentioned buyback in the presentation. I might have missed this, but is that a new kind of \u2013 are you guys going to be stepping up buybacks in a significant way here in the near-term? Is it a change in tone on buybacks or pretty consistent with what you have said historically?\nMonish Patolawala: No, Steve, it\u2019s pretty consistent. As the level of buyback is always our fourth priority in the four priorities to the extent the amount of buyback will always get determined by the amount of cash we have, what the market is doing, what the opportunities are. And as I mentioned in the fourth quarter, we saw an opportunity where we thought the stock was attractive. And we felt we should step up buyback in the fourth quarter, but no change in tone, that still remains the fourth priority in our list of capital allocation priorities.\nStephen Tusa: Okay. Thanks for being straightforward. Thank you.\nMonish Patolawala: Thanks.\nMike Roman: Thanks Steve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin: Yes. Good morning.\nMike Roman: Good morning Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Yes. So, my first question is on Asia and specifically as we see Omicron in China, what\u2019s the feedback you are getting on the ground about the scope of shutdowns versus what was expecting around the Olympics? And how is that going to play out in the first quarter given what you are seeing right now? Thanks.\nMike Roman: Yes. Andrew, I would say what we came through December into the New Year, there is a lot of uncertainty around Omicron and how it\u2019s going to impact supply chains globally. And in China, obviously, an important focus there and with the Olympics coming a spotlight on that as well. We have been managing supply chain, logistics issues there as well. You saw that a little bit play out in the China export numbers in Q4, down like low-single digits, I think for the quarter. So, it\u2019s something we are focused on. We have been managing through the challenges we have seen and we will update you as we get further into February and March.\nAndrew Obin: And just the second question is almost 2 years into COVID and maybe it\u2019s a little preview for your Analyst Day. But almost 2 years into COVID, what portions of your portfolio sort of look structurally better and what has lagged? And what do you think happens as the world normalizes again? Thanks.\nMike Roman: Yes, Andrew, maybe I will start with we have been investing \u2013 accelerated investments in a number of areas as we come through COVID and it\u2019s really recognizing some of the trends, maybe even that we came into the pandemic with that accelerated. So, we talk about investments in automotive electrification, maybe less COVID-related, but certainly a trend that\u2019s accelerating. We saw home improvement accelerate during COVID. So, we are investing in those areas. We are seeing strong growth as we came through 2021 in those areas, and we see that continuing as we go forward. So, that\u2019s the way we look at it. There is \u2013 across our portfolio, we have talked often about different parts of our portfolio, how are they doing relative year-over-year even back to 2019. I would say we had strength in broad parts of the portfolio, including those that we are investing in. There is a couple of areas that are still recovering. And Monish even highlighted one in his comments about how elective procedures are still at about 90% of medical procedures that is at about 90% of where they were in 2019. So, there is the impact of COVID on increased hospitalization rates and the knock-on effect on healthcare, there is still \u2013 we think there is still some impact net-net versus 2019 in some of those areas. So, it plays out a little differently across our portfolio, even where we saw strong demand in our home care, in our cleaning products in 2020, of tough comp and a little lower growth as we came through 2021. So, there is a number of trends that we are watching, again, prioritizing where we see an opportunity to invest and leverage 3M\u2019s strengths and then \u2013 and managing those other areas to \u2013 in the middle of the supply chain disruptions to serve customers as things recover.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our final question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question.\nJohn Walsh: Hi. Good morning and thanks for fitting me in here.\nMike Roman: Good morning John.\nJohn Walsh: Maybe just one question from me and going back, I think to a comment you made in response to Nigel\u2019s question around restructuring. I thought I heard $70 million. Just wanted to make sure that was kind of capturing all the restructuring delta and asked if that was in line with the Q3 update, because I guess by my math, I had a little bit higher of a number, but I just wanted to ask for clarification there.\nMonish Patolawala: Yes, it\u2019s a good one, John. So, you heard it right, it\u2019s $70 million. And the reason is we achieved more in the fourth quarter than we had previously thought. And that\u2019s why you also saw margins came in higher and because we achieve more. So, just to recap the program, in total, we have spent the program that was announced in Q4 of 2020. We had said we would go in \u2013 we have spent $260 million to-date. We had told you in Q3 that it would be $300 million to $325 million. Right now, we are saying up to $300 million. We had said benefits would be in the range of $200 million to $250 million. We achieved approximately $180 million in that program. So, there is a carryover benefit of $70 million.\nJohn Walsh: Great. Appreciate the clarification. Thank you.\nMonish Patolawala: Thanks.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.\nMike Roman: Thank you. To wrap up, I am proud of our team\u2019s performance in 2021, and we are well positioned for a successful 2022. I look forward to talking to you again at our February 14th meeting.

In the third quarter end-year-to-date, we have delivered broad-based organic growth across all business groups and geographic areas, along with good margins and strong cash flow.  Q3 organic growth was over 6% as we drove innovation across our market-leading businesses with margins of 20% and earnings of $2.45 per share. Geographically, growth in the quarter was led by the Americas, up 7% with the US up 6% growth in APAC was 6% with China up 3%, and Japan up 6%.  While EMEA grew 4%. With respect to the macro-environment, overall end-market demand remains strong, though the semiconductor shortage continues to impact many markets, most visibly in electronics and automotive. As we navigate near-term uncertainty, we continue to invest in growth, productivity, and sustainability, which I will discuss shortly. We are also actively managing disruptions in the global supply chain with a relentless focus on customer service. Looking at our performance through nine months, we have executed well and delivered 11% organic growth, with all business groups about 10%, along with margins of 22% and earnings of $7.81 per share.  Today, we are updating full-year expectations for organic growth to a range of 8% to 9% and EPS to a range of $9.70 to $9.90, reflecting our results to-date and ongoing supply chain challenges. I would like to make a few comments on how 3M is actively managing those challenges. As you know, many companies are facing supply chain disruptions. The result of a convergence of issues, including the Delta variant, strong demand, energy and labor shortages, and extreme weather events.  For example, ocean freight costs have more than doubled over the last year. And the number of containers on the water is up 70% because of port congestion.Suppliers are challenged to provide consistent and predictable supply. On any given day we are working with more than 300 suppliers with critical constraints. With manufacturing sites in 35 countries around the world. And as a $5 billion annual exporter out of the US, we are working tirelessly to serve our customers.  The cornerstone of 3M's response is our expertise and deep relationships across the supply chain along with our local for local managed factoring and supply chain strategy, which helps us move with agility and keep our factories running. We have daily meetings with suppliers to strengthen our planning, and in some instances, are strategically prioritizing geographies and markets and portfolios.  Hard but necessary decisions to ensure we meet the most critical needs of our customers. We are moving product in different ways, such as expanding our use of rail, shipping out of more flexible ports, and increasing our use of charter flights by over 40%, while deploying new capabilities to better track our flow of goods in real-time. Maintaining talent is also key and we are using several tactics to attract new workers while protecting the health and safety of all of our employees.  Some of our actions have impacted our productivity and gross margins,which Monish will touch on. But we will do what is necessary to take care of customers. The combination of strong demand along with supply chain challenges is also contributing to broad-based inflation. We're taking multiple actions to help offset inflationary pressures, including price increases, dual-sourcing, and improving factory yields, with more work to do.  Ultimately, the duration of these supply chain challenges is difficult to predict. We remain focused on serving customers, managing backlogs, and making good on our commitments, delivering the unique, high-quality products that are the hallmark of 3M. Please turn to Slide 5. While we execute day-to-day, we are investing to drive long-term growth and capitalize on trends in large, attractive markets.  In home improvement for example, we have multiple $0.5 billion plus franchises that keep families healthier and more productive, including our fast-growing command, damage-free hanging solutions and Filtrete, home filtration products.These brands leverage 3M's deep expertise in adhesives and non-woven materials. The same technologies helping drive success in our automotive business, which consistently outgrows build rates. Auto electrification sales are up 40% year-to-date. On the strength of new innovations, including advanced display technologies as automobiles become the next consumer electronic device. In healthcare, the biopharma market is growing more than 10% annually. With our business up more than 30% year-to-date as 3M Science has supported the unprecedented pace of advancement over the past 18 months to develop therapeutics and vaccines, and scale manufacturing to help address the pandemic. The fundamental strengths of 3M our unique technology platforms, advanced manufacturing, global capabilities, and leading brands position us to win. And we will continue to invest in these areas.  In a similar way, we're driving productivity by advancing digital capabilities across our operations, allowing us to expand our use of data and data analytics. In sustainability, we have achieved 50% renewable electricity use in our operations, four years ahead of our timeline, on our way to 100%. We are advancing the environmental goals we announced earlier in the year, making the investments to accelerate our ability to achieve carbon neutrality, reduced water use, and improve the quality of water returned to the environment from our industrial processes. In addition, we are proactively managing PFAS, making our factories and communities stronger and more sustainable. In Cottage Grove Minnesota, we recently announced that we are closing our incinerator and partnering with a leading disposal Company to more efficiently manage our waste streams. We just broke ground to add new filtration technology in Cordova Illinois. [inaudible 00:09:50] Belgium, we're working with government officials to resolve issues related to p fast and we will invest up to a 125 million Euros over the next 3 years to improve water quality around our factories.  These proactive initiatives and others are accelerating 3M's ability to go beyond current regulatory standards and deliver on our commitments. With respect to the P fast strategic road map announced last week, 3M remains committed to working with the Biden administration, EPA, and others, and taking a science-based approach to managing PFS. Let me also touch on a few litigation updates. Last week, we announced a collaborative agreement to resolve litigation related PFAS in our facility, indicator Alabama.  The impact is included in our previously disclosed reserves. On combat arms, there have been for Bellwether trials so far, with six additional trials here in the fourth quarter, we are early in this litigation and will continue to actively defend ourselves, including through the appeal process. As always, we encourage you to read our 10-Q for updates on all litigation matters.  To wrap up, we are driving strong results in a challenging environment, investing in attractive end markets and positioning 3M for continued growth. I'm proud of our 3M team, which is united by a common purpose, Unlocking the power of people, ideas, and science, to re-imagine what's possible and create what's next. Now, we will turn it over Monish, who will cover the details of the quarter. Monish.\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you, Mike. And I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 6. As I look back on the quarter, the 3M team demonstrated the resilience of our business model and the relevance of our technologies as we executed well in a very challenging environment, effectively navigating the supply-chain disruptions while serving and innovating for our customers.  Though manufacturing, raw materials, and logistics challenges persisted throughout the quarter. We continue to invest in the business while driving operating rigor and managing costs. Turning to the third quarter, financial results, sales were $8.9 billion up 7.1% year-on-year, or an increase of 6.3% on an organic basis. Operating income was $1.8 billion down 6% with operating margins of 20% coming in at the top end of the range, which we had previously communicated in mid-September.  Third quarter earnings per share were $2.45, which was similar to last year. On this slide, you can see the components that impacted both operating margins and earnings per share as compared to Q3 last year. Our strong year-on-year organic volume growth was more than offset by the headwinds resulting from the global supply chain challenges, investments in growth and sustainability, and litigation-related costs. Combined, these impacts lowered operating margins by 1.4 percentage points, and earnings per share by $0.02 year-on-year. The restructuring program we announced in Q4 of last year remains on track.  As part of this program we incurred a Pretax restructuring charge of $50 million in the third quarter. This charge was offset by the benefits we achieved this quarter. Moving to price and raw materials. As expected, increases in selling price gain traction as we went through the quarter with year-on-year selling prices up 140 basis points in Q3 versus 10 basis points in Q2. However, we continue to experience higher costs for raw materials, logistics, and outsourced manufacturing, which outpaced the increase in selling prices.  Thus, third-quarter net selling price and raw materials performance reduced both operating margins and earnings by 130 basis points and $0.12 per share, respectively versus Q3 last year. Looking at Q4, we expect our selling price actions to continue to gain traction as we work to mitigate the raw material and logistics inflationary pressures we have experienced throughout the year. Next, foreign currency net of hedging impacts, reduced margins, 20 basis points, and earnings by $0.01 per share.Also, 3 other non-operating items impacted our year-on-year earnings per share performance.  First, lower other expenses resulted in an $0.08 earnings benefit. Consistent with prior quarters, non-operating pension was a $0.05 benefit, along with the $0.02 benefit from net interest due to our proactive early redemption of debt. Secondly, a lower tax rate versus last year provided a $0.09 benefit to earnings per share. The tax rate was lower due to favorable adjustments this year related to impacts of U.S. international tax provisions. Our year-to-date tax rate is 18.8%.  Therefore, we now expect our full-year tax rate in the range of 18.5 to 19.5% versus 20 to 21% previously. And finally, average diluted shares outstanding increased 1% versus Q3 last year, lowering per share earnings by $0.02. Please turn to slide 7 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. Third-quarter adjusted free cash flow of $1.5 billion was down 29% year-on-year with conversion of a 107% Adjusted free cash flow year-to-date was $4.5 billion, which was similar to last year, with free cash flow conversion of 98%. The decline in our year-on-year free cash flow performance was primarily driven by higher inventory balances due to strong customer demand, along with raw material inflation, and more goods in transit as a result of the ongoing global supply chain challenges. Third quarter capital expenditures were $343 million and $1 billion year-to-date. For the full-year, we now expect Capex investments in the range of $1.5 to $1.6 billion versus being at the low end of our prior range of $1.8 to $2 billion. We continue to step up investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability.  However, the pace of projects continues to be impacted by supply chain and vendor constraints. During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $856 million and share repurchases of $527 million year-to-date. we have returned $3.8 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Our net debt position, strong cash flow generation capability, and disciplined capital allocation continues to provide us financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities, and return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure.  Please turn to slide 8, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q3. I will start with our safety and industrial business, which posted organic growth of 6.1% year-on-year in the third quarter. Organic growth was driven by continued robust industrial manufacturing activities, along with prior-year pandemic-related impacts. First, our personal safety business declined 4% organically, up against a 40% pandemic-driven comparison a year ago.  Third Quarter disposable respirator sales decreased 7% organically year-on-year, and 15% sequentially. Looking ahead, we anticipate continued deceleration in disposable respirator demand through the balance of this year and into 2022. Turning to the rest of safety and industrial, organic growth was led by double-digit increases in adhesives and tapes, abrasives, and electrical markets. In addition, closure and masking systems was up high single-digits.  Automotive aftermarket, up low-single-digits, while roofing granules declined against a strong comparison from last year. Safety and Industrial's third quarter operating income was $620 million down 20% versus last year. Operating margins were 19.2% down 650 basis points year-on-year, as leverage on sales growth was more than offset by ongoing increases in raw materials, logistics, and litigation-related costs, along with manufacturing productivity impacts. Moving to transportation and electronics which grew 5.1% organically despite the continued impact of semiconductor supply chain constraints.  Our Auto OEM business was flat year-on-year, compared to the 20% decline in global car and light truck bills. This out performance was due to a few factors. First, we continue to grow our penetration by driving 3M innovation onto new automotive platforms. Second, we saw notable increase in channel inventories at tier suppliers.  Given the dramatic reductions in OEMS bill forecast through the quarter. Lastly, we benefited from a vehicle model mix standpoint as auto OEMS produce more premium vehicles, which tend to have higher 3M content. Our electronics-related business decline low single-digits organically, with declines across consumer electronics, particularly smartphones and TVs, as OEMs face production challenges due to ongoing semiconductor constraints, and COVID-related impacts. These declines were partially offset by continued strong demand for our products and solutions in semiconductor and factory automation end markets. Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics, Advanced Materials and Commercial Solutions each grew double-digits year-on-year, while Transportation Safety grew low-single digits. Third quarter operating income was $465 million down 9% year-on-year.  Operating margins were 19% down 320 basis points year-on-year, driven by strong leverage on sales growth, which was more than offset by increases in raw materials and logistics costs, along with manufacturing productivity impacts. Turning to our healthcare business, which delivered third quarter organic sales growth of 3.3%Our medical Solutions business declined, low single-digits organically impacted by the continued decline in demand for disposable respirator.  Along with the pace of hospital elective procedure volumes, which came in at the low end of industry expectations of 90 to 95% for the quarter. in our Auto Care business grew low, double-digits year-on-year as dental procedures continued to be near pre - COVID levels. The separation and purification business increased high single-digits year-on-year due to ongoing demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccines and therapeutics. Health information systems grew low double-digits driven by strong growth in clinician solutions.  And finally, food-safety increased double-digits as food service activity returns. Healthcare's third quarter operating income was $529 million, up 7% year-on-year. Operating margins were 23.5% up 70 basis points. Third quarter margins were driven by leverage on sales growth, which is partially offset by the increasing raw materials and logistics cost, manufacturing productivity impacts, along with increased investments in growth.  Lastly, third quarter organic growth for our consumer business, was 7.6% year-on-year with continued strong sell-in and sell-out trends across most retail channels. Our home improvement business continues to perform well, up high single-digits on top of a strong comparison from a year ago. This business continued to experience strong demand, particularly in our command and Filtrete category, leading franchises.  Stationery and office grew double-digits organically in Q3, as this business laps last year's COVID -related comparisons. We also had strong back-to-school consumer demand and holiday related sell-in for scotch branded packaging and shipping products, posted solutions and scotch branded home and office tapes.Our home care business was up low single-digits versus last year's strong COVID -driven comparison.  And finally, our consumer health and safety business was up high single-digits as we lap COVID -related impacts from a year ago. Consumers operating income was $332 million down 3% year-on-year. Operating margins were 21.7% down basis points, as increased costs for raw materials, logistics, and outsourced hard goods manufacturing, more than offset leverage from sales growth.  Please turn to slide 9 for a discussion of our full-year 2021 guidance. As we reflect on the macroeconomic environment, we expect demand to remain strong across most end markets. However, uncertainty persists given the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, along with the well-known global supply chain, raw materials, and logistics challenges that all companies are working through.  Looking ahead, we remain focused on our customers and doing what is necessarily to solve them as we continue to navigate the fluid environment. Turning to guidance, we're increasing the bottom end of our expectations for organic growth. We now project our full-year organic growth to be in the range of 8% - 9% versus our prior range of 6% - 9%. With respect to earnings, we anticipate a range of $9.70 to $9.90 per share as compared to our prior range of $9.70 to $10.10. And finally, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow, therefore, we are maintaining our free cash flow conversion range of 90 to 100%.  This updated outlook implies a wider than normal fourth quarter range accounting for ongoing impacts of COVID and the uncertain supply-chain environment. For example, from a growth perspective, the well-known constraints in semiconductor chip supply are impacting more and more end markets, most notably automotive and consumer electronics, as reflected in the low production forecast for the year. We anticipate global elective healthcare procedure volumes to stabilize with recent trends.  Relative to disposable respirator, we expect continued impacts from the decline in healthcare related demand along with elevated inventory levels in the industrial channel. And finally, we expect our pricing actions to continue to gain traction as we work to mitigate raw material and logistics cost pressures.  Turning to operations. As we have discussed, we are actively managing inefficiencies in global supply chains with a relentless focus on customer service. Therefore, we are adjusting demand plans with greater frequency. And as a result, incurring more manufacturing production changeovers along with expediting shipments. All of these actions are impacting both costs and productivity. But we 're taking the necessary steps to ensure we meet the most critical needs of our customers. We continue to make progress relative to December 2020 restructuring announcement. To date, we have incurred over $240 million in pretax restructuring charges and anticipate an additional $25 to $50 million in Q4. We now expect total pretax restructuring charges of $300 to $325 million versus our original expectations of $250 to $300 million.  We expect the remaining actions under this program to be initiated by the first quarter of 2022. In addition, we expect to incur higher costs related to our ongoing litigation matters, along with increases in our other indirect related costs like travel expense. And finally, we continue to invest in the business for the long term. And therefore anticipate increased investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability.  To close, I would like to take a moment to thank our customers who have placed their faith in us, our vendors who are tirelessly working with us to ensure continuity of supply, and most importantly, our 90,000 plus 3Mers who continue to deliver for our customers. We have a very steady eye on the long term to deliver growth, margin, and cash through strong operating rigor, while continuing to navigate the uncertainty in the short-run. With that, I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instruction]\nOperator: First question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning and thanks for the details on the quarter. So Monish, you mentioned the 19%, 20% margin for 3Q. You came in at the high end of that range. Obviously, you'd like to be conservative, but I'm just curious, what's in better or maybe not quite as bad as you expected or see it back in mid-September.\nMonish Patolawala: That's great question, Nigel. I think when I gave you the range of 19% to 20%, as we have said in my prepared remarks, we were facing a lot of inflation. At the same time, there is a lot of uncertainty as regards volumes, as regards supply chain flow. And then third, I'd also mentioned that as we were facing all those items, we were also doing our own self-help versus just letting these things go through whether it was guild sourcing, whether it was controlling some of our expenses, etc.  And then you put all that together, we came in at the 20%. If you look at where we ended up, I would say inflation came in pretty much where we thought it was going to be. We executed on price, we moved from 10 basis points of price increase in Q2 to a 140 basis points in Q3. So that was pretty much in line, and we were able to execute more volumes of our vendors. with flow of supply. We were able to get good flow supply.  There's strong demand, as Mike said, and we were able to execute the demand, as well as we controlled our expenses across the corporation to make sure that we were prioritizing on serving our customers and trying to mitigate impact of inflation as much as we could. So put all that in, we came in at the 20% versus the range of 19 to 20 that I mentioned earlier.\nNigel Coe: That's great. Thank you.On the margin bridge, based on -- based on your 4Q for your full-year guidance, looks like 4Q margins looked at an 18 handle. Maybe my math offset, but I'd be curious if you can maybe talk to that and maybe the two major margin budget items, the volume productivity, supply chain, and pipe costs 100.8 base points negative on volume productivity and 130 on price cost this quarter. How does that look in a broad sense for 4Q year-over-year?\nMonish Patolawala: So I would start by sayin, Nigel, a couple of things. So your math is not real, if you follow the implied guide that we gave you. It's directionally very close. I think a couple of things on just the items you talked about, which is priced raw. We expect to continue to have continued momentum in price in the fourth quarter.  You saw us again go up from 10 to 140 basis points and we should see that go up as price continues to take hold across the various geographies and product lines, things that we've talked about before. I would say we don't see the raw material or the inflation environment slowing down in any way. I think you're going to see that volatility.  It's going to depend on what the holiday season does. It depends on what logistics costs are going to be. Our goal is to get to neutral. The question is going to be, how does raw materials at some point play itself out, and do we see a turn in some of the commodities like, polypropylene, ethylene, etc, where we have seen a lot of inflation?  I would say that's number 1 on your question. I think there was another point on bridge on revenue. I would just say if you're looking 3 to 4Q, just remember there are a couple of things that impact 3M. There's one less billing day from 3Q to 4Q and secondly, you have a normal seasonality that you have in 3M as many of the factories with our industrial customers slowed down during the holidays and that's the impact. So I think you've answered your question, but if there's anything else I'm happy to answer, Nate.\nNigel Coe: No, that's perfect Monish.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nMike Roman: Hey, Jeff. Good morning.\nJeff Sprague: Just want to pick a touch on auto a little bit. Kind of extraordinary divergence and the numbers there as you laid out, I just wondered, does that create some kind of significant headwind for you now, as you look forward, obviously we should have volumes going up, but may have suppliers, I think that burn off inventory and mix shifts back. I was wondering if you could give us a little more perspective on what's going on there.\nMike Roman: Maybe there's a couple of parts to that I'll talk about. The first -- if you look at what we've done year-to-date, it's really been reflective of our innovation, something we've been talking about for some time, we outgrow the build rates and even in dynamic like this year where the build rates are swinging down as there were some challenges in OEM production plans for Q3 and the outlook for Q4 being similar.  We're continuing to drive our innovations when spec -in's and design-in opportunities. And then Monish mentioned the mix of vehicles in this demand environment is more premium, which we have a higher level of penetration in those vehicles. We also have very good growth in our Auto electrification. priority growth platform and broadly, and getting good traction, 40% year-to-date. So those are all driving that performance as we come through a year-to-date and we expect to be able to continue to perform build rates as we go forward.  The channel -- everybody is challenged with matching up to the changes in production plans, and these are changing quickly and the dynamic has been challenging for the supply chains, and I would say everyone in the value chain to keep up with. That said we see inventory trying to track pretty well with that. We don't see really -- in our results, we're not seeing a year-to-date of impact from excess inventory, so it's really about matching up with where the mix is going, where the build rates are going, and again, we see good momentum in our portfolio against those build rates.\nJeff Sprague: And just on your, maybe your Capex and what you are seeing your customers do. When I heard Monish talk about seasonal slowdown with everybody of run and full out here and trying to get caught up. Do you actually think it's possible we don't have a normal seasonal slowdown as people try that kind of execute on some of these backlogs and kind of separate move, a little bit unrelated, but your own Capex, what sort of projects did you have planned that are sliding to the right?\nMonish Patolawala: Yeah. It is -- good question Jeff. Listen, as we're trying to be helpful by giving you what we're seeing right now. Is there a possibility that customers continuing to keep running through 24/7, and that there's more production that comes out from them. Absolutely possible and as Mike mentioned in so have I, will do whatever it takes to make sure that we keep serving our customers. Overall, I would still say this is a short-term phenomenon.  Long-term, we're seeing good end-market trends. And that's why you're seeing us continue to invest. So your point on the next piece which is Capex and where we were I would say the areas where we're looking to keep investing, we're in all the 3 buckets, growth, productivity, and sustainability, and the cycle times to get Capex raw material for these businesses is just taking longer than we had originally thought. And that's why we had to slow it down to 1.5 to 1.6, but I would just end by -- your question by saying, Jeff, we are not done with the quarter.  This team knows how to fight, we are going to keep doing whatever it takes to keep serving for our customers as long as the demand is there and at the same time, the teams furiously working to make sure that we mitigate some of the raw material pressure that we have, as well as keep investing for growth, productivity, and sustainability because we just see the long term to be very bright where we can grow above the macro, we can get margin expansion and keep having strong cash.\nJeff Sprague: Great, thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, Good morning. Maybe just the first question around China, Hong Kong demand. And obviously 3M has a very large presence in the region. Good perspectives on different industries. The growth rate slowed, I think to 3% in Q3, that was down from low double-digit last Quarter and low thirties in Q1.  So just wondered, do we think that that China, Hong Kong may be down in the fourth quarter and maybe just describe how you see what's going on there as being maybe different or idiosyncratic or do you think about pace of slowdown is a good template for what we should expect elsewhere in the world as the demand recovery matures.\nMike Roman: Yes, Julian, if you look -- step back and look at year-to-date, China 's up mid-teens for us. So that, I think reflective of strong growth through Q3. And as you pointed out, we saw a 3% in the quarter. I would say it's having an impact from the same things we've been talking about, supply chain, logistics, port closures. Those are impacting our business. And just as a reminder, our business in China, so we manufacture most of what we sell in China in factories in China.  And we sell to customers -- about 50% of them exposed to exports about 50% to the domestic market. And the exports are probably one of the areas that's hard to sit. So it's down about 10%. Looking forward, that's the expectation as we go forward with Q4. So that'll be one of the impacts, has been one of the impacts being hurt most by the supply chain challenges for us,our focus in China has really been very much in line with what we've been talking about as we came through the pandemic, we see market segments that are high-growth and we've been prioritizing investments there and we see those growth trends continuing.  So we are that's where we're focused -- we're focused where we have the kind of the winning solutions. And we do see opportunities across each of our businesses year-to-date, we've been led with strong growth in Our Home Care business are actually in Q3 and the Healthcare business we expect that to continue as we go into Q4.\nMonish Patolawala: Julian, just to add to Mike's point on all the items you mentioned on the macro trends. Just on a year-over-year basis to for the quarter at 3%. You also got to look at the comp of last year. We had a very strong growth in China, if you remember, the third quarter of last year, you had seen China starting to come out of the pandemic first. So their order patterns were higher in the end of like June and then into the third quarter.And that's the other reason you see a 3%\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful.Thank you.Maybe just my follow-up around safety and industrial margins,understand what's going on with some of the markets in terms of supply chain constraints and the impact that's having on margins.  But maybe focusing on the impact of the legal costs. And also as the respirator business moves slower sequentially. Any color you could provide on the impact that those two things are having on margins. Perhaps sizing that legal headwind. And do we expect that to bleed into next year as well? Thank you.\nMonish Patolawala: Yes, sure Julian.There are 2 ones, on the legal one, the combat arms litigation that we are incurring costs on show up in the CBG margins. As Mike mentioned, we are continuing to defend ourselves in that litigation. There's an acceleration in the fourth quarter. We will have EPS 5 more of these for which we're going to prepare. I would say, depending on how the litigation goes. Do you see it bleed into '22?  Yes, because the MDS will all not be done by fourth quarter of 2021 On disposable respirators as we've talked about, depending on seeing how the pandemic has played itself out. We felt Q1 was peak. We had mentioned that even in our last earnings call, we have seen revenue consistently, sequentially come down. You have seen we came down nearly 6% in the [Indiscernible] in the third quarter.  We see that further down between 75 to a 125 on a year-over-year basis or 25 to 75 sequentially. And depending on where the pandemic goes, that will have an impact into 2022. But again, we've seeing pockets where you are seeing COVID cases go up, where you are seeing demand go up and then in other cases, you're starting to see demand come down. So it's pretty dynamic on the disposable respirator side, but as we've talked before, we've got capacity of 2.5 billion respirators that we can ramp up very quickly.  The team's done a really nice job of managing this environment in certain cases, we have shutdown manufacturing lines in certain cases, we are managing our inventory levels as we go through this, but we'll be ready for the next factor event. And hopefully never happens. But that's not being the history of the world, but we'll be ready for that.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Millios Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Good morning, everybody.\nMike Roman: Hi, Scott.\nScott Davis: The price increase in the quarter was a pretty dramatic quarter-to-quarter sequential change, but we've clearly seen pretty big step-ups in CPI and PPI. What -- when you think about 4Q and kind of think about the ramp into 2022, do you continue with this aggressive of a ramp. Is there any mitigating factors that holds you back from getting price?  I mean, I don't think I remember you guys being as far below CPI before. But these are strange times too. So I'm not sure it really matters. Just some color on that ramp would be helpful. Thank you.\nMonish Patolawala: Sure, Scott. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, you will see us continue to gain price in the fourth quarter. I know they've been quite a few questions around why it has taken us this long to get price. As we mentioned before, we follow up pretty methodical approach of taking consistent, taking price across geographies. We work with our customers. In certain cases, we are working with contracts and the constraints in those contracts.  And we put a pretty thoughtful approach to how we go after price increases. How it goes into 2022, Scott, I think will also depend on where we see inflation going to be in '22 and beyond. Right now, I think we're comfortable with the price increases that we've taken, but we're going to keep doing it as long as we need to. As I mentioned the goal of the team is to get to neutral, but it's going to highly depend upon what happens with inflation.  So I don't know if I answered your question, but that's how we're thinking about pricing from that angle. And we try to be as -- again, as I've said before, thoughtful and methodical in how we go [Indiscernible] we have a pretty rigorous approach on how we approach our customers and we try to work it as a partnership with both. And you've got different businesses, so you've got specting businesses where you are specting for a certain period of time.  You got healthcare where you got half my business where it's easier to take price. In other cases that are contracts. And then you've got the industrial margins, which is distributor lead. And then you've got the consumer business where we working with all the big retailer. So each one of them have a different dynamic. And we factor all that in and you've seen that we have made progress in Q3 and we'll keep making progress in Q4 and beyond.\nScott Davis: As a follow-up in -- the China comments were helpful, but can you talk about some of the other major emerging markets and what you've seen as far as improvements or decrements over the quarter and outlook? Thank you.\nMike Roman: Sure. Thanks to God. And just as a reminder, if you remember back to 2019, we aligned our businesses, now around four go-to-market models are globally. And so those businesses are executing global strategies locally everywhere around the world. And they -- each of them have a view of each of the regions, but I'll give you a view at a higher level.  So we talked about America's being up 7% in the quarter and low double-digits year-to-date. The highest growth as we came through the quarters in Latin America and Canada and up double-digits across all business groups.  So again, similar to what we talked about. And the way we are seeing year-to-date demand across 3M globally, broad-based across business groups in the Americas. And I'd say it's still in a strong position, up 6% in the Quarter and double-digits for the year. EMEA, if you look at how we're doing there, we're growing high single-digits for the year, 9%, 4% in the quarter. We haven't seen a strong rebound in growth as other areas, but we are seeing a recovery now in healthcare and transportation and electronics starting to help drive that growth that we are seeing.  And in Asia-Pacific, grown mid-teens year-to-date, double-digit growth across the business groups. All business groups again, and as I mentioned, and we talked about China, mentioned Japan and in prepared remarks, that's been one of the improving areas is Japan now starting to see improving growth as we come through the year.  So not down -- not near the pre-COVID levels, yet. But again, starting to see some improvements, and in that case also being led by healthcare. So we're seeing some -- I would say the recovery of the electric procedures around the world being one of the dynamics that's helping to start drive improving growth.\nScott Davis: Thank you. Good luck, guys.\nMonish Patolawala: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets, please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nMonish Patolawala: Hi Deane\nDeane Dray: We've heard lots of specifics on material cost inflation. I'd like to hear some color on labor costs, labor shortages. I know Mike highlighted in the opening remarks about new initiatives for recruiting, I'd imagine higher comp and benefits are among those. And is this more of U.S. centered headwind or just how labor costs and shortages look globally? And start there, please.\nMonish Patolawala: So I would say, Dean e, it's a global item but it's more pronounced right now for us in the U.S. So we are seeing higher cost, whether it is cost driven by some of the i tems Mike mentioned as well as with the demand that we have, we are spending more money on overtime. And also we are seeing cost of inflation, which is labor cost that comes through us, through outsource manufacturing hard goods that we buy, we're also seeing inflation on that. But with that said, I do want to recognize all the employees of 3M who are tirelessly working to make sure that we are delivering for our customers in this tough demand environment, as well as a very tough supply environment. But we're confident, Dean e, will get through this.\nDeane Dray: Do you have a year-over-year labor cost? Any kind of specifics you can help us with?\nMonish Patolawala: I don't have it very specific. I can ask Bruce to follow up and give you an answer. But just if you go back to the bridge on the walk for Q3, you can see there's a 140 basis points of pressure due to organic volume and productivity. Some of that is driven by labor constraints. In other words, the higher cost, but at the same time, making sure that we have all the production that we can make. And some of it is driven by the fact that we have had to have more changeovers because raw material has not been flowing properly.\nDeane Dray: Got it. And just as a follow-up on the Copaxone litigation, I was hoping you could comment on the strength of your insurance coverage. Both - we're just whether it's P fast specifically will see headline settlements. What we don't always have line of sight on is the insurance coverage. Are there any coverage limits and just help us frame for us the strength that the insurance coverage, if you could.\nMonish Patolawala: Yeah, so we do have insurance coverage. We are working with our various insurance providers through multiple dialogues that we keep having with them. But as you know, some of these things take time. So when we do get those settlements in, we'll definitely keep your costs too.\nDeane Dray: Okay. Thank you.\nMonish Patolawala: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America, please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin: Good morning.\nMike Roman: Hey, Andrew\nMonish Patolawala: Hey, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Hey, there's a question for bigger picture question for Mike and maybe Monish. I think 3M has a fairly unique integrated model, and the way your supply chain flows internationally, I think inside the Company is also fairly unique. Do these current supply chain constraints and shipping constraints: A, give you an opportunity to re-evaluate how your internal supply chain are constructed? and -- yeah, I'll just leave it at that.\nMike Roman: Yeah, Andrew, it's one of our fundamental strengths and back to what Monish was talking about, how we're focused on delivering for customers. We're leveraging the strengths of our 3M model. The idea that we talked about in the prepared remarks, local for local, building our capabilities across our value model to the customers close to them regionally around the world. And that has been a strength as we've come through COVID and I would say this year as we deal with the interruption in supply chain, this regional strategy has allowed us to be more agile in just what Monish was talking about, the changing nature of our production plans in our production wheels in our -- what we're doing in our factory. So we have a lot of flexibility built in. I would say we are always evaluating how to better serve customers, how do we look at our lean value streams and how do we take new strategies into that getting -- based on, I would say, the improving visibility we have, we see opportunities to be more efficient and improve our cycle times and so on. So I -- we're always looking at changes.  I do think the model that we have has served us well and it's been great place to respond to the challenges. And I think that's the foundation as we go ahead. It's how do we make that better? How do we drive better performance, improving operational efficiency? So building on those strengths is where I'd leave you with.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you, Mike. And just a follow-up question. I apologize if I missed it, but on electric procedures, what's your best guess with sort of falling COVID cases in the U.S.? What's the most likely trajectory for likely procedures over the next, let's say 6 months?\nMonish Patolawala: So Andrew, that's one, of course, we keep watching very closely. We -- for the quarter, we ended up at -- I think the industry ended up at a lower end of the 90% to 95% that was originally forecasted. Part of it was, I think September was a tougher month as many countries saw a spike in COVID cases.  Our belief, and I think it's the industry's believe, that we should stabilize in the fourth quarter and we hopefully get back to the 90% to 95% range as we get into the fourth quarter. And then the bigger discussion around the industries, what does 2022 and beyond look like? The reason is a lot of these elective procedures that have been slowed down are elective, but they are still time-sensitive at the end of the day.  So there's -- so that's what we'll have to see and see both capacities added in all the countries we have to see how cases go -- play out from a COVID perspective. But I also think hospitals are far better equipped right now, or more prepared to deal with this. So our hope is that, elective procedures come back up to 2019 levels in 2022. When it happens, I think will depend on different parts of cases in the world, but that's how we see it.\nAndrew Obin: Do you see the possibility of a cumulative catch-up in '22?\nMonish Patolawala: Well, that's -- I think that's the debate, right? Who knows? But I think that's going to depend basically on hospital preparedness as well as patient readiness to come into the hospital to get their surgeries done. From our end, we would rather have the volume than not have the volume. So, I would say it will be a good problem to have, but I think we'll have to see what happens.\nAndrew Obin: Thanks a lot, guys. Good luck.\nEveryone: Thanks to you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nNicole DeBlase: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nEveryone: Hi Nicole.\nNicole DeBlase: I just wanted to dig into what you guys are seeing from a supply chain perspective a bit more. So if you could talk about any changes in the key bottlenecks versus last quarter's update. And is there a sense at all that there's green shoots here meeting that is there any possibility that the supply chain issues or headwinds have peaks?\nMike Roman: While Nicole, I go back to it, it really is a convergence of multiple factors. And so you've got to pull those apart a little bit. The strong demand we think will continue to see strong demand. So that's going to put pressure on the supply chains going forward. We've seen challenges and labor shortages, the pandemic has impacted production, semiconductor shortages are impacting end markets for us in particular. And then we were also impacted as we went through the year with some extreme weather events which interrupted our raw material supply. Those are getting better. So some of the raw material supply issues that we were facing are getting better as we go and we do expect supply chains to improve. It's difficult to estimate or predict the duration of each of these factors and how they play with each other and watching the congestion in logistics is one of the things that we are carefully looking for improvements in as well.  Can we move back to more normal logistics patterns for us as we go forward, that will be a good sign that broadly supply chain disruptions are improving. But you have to keep an eye on each of these aspects to see step-by-step. And we do -- we are optimistic, we are hopeful as we get into 2022, that we're going to continue to see improvements.\nMonish Patolawala: Nicole, we also have a control tower that has been set up, so we're constantly watching whether it is the port congestion, whether it is shutdown of airports, whether it is customers, suppliers telling us that raw material, maybe few hours. So that's why we have new changings in our factories faster to keep other products moving so that we just make sure that we keep customer demand as well as customer demand itself is pretty variable right now. And that's another big thing that control towers doing his watching customer demand and then adjusting supply as needed.\nNicole DeBlase: Got it. Thanks, Monish, thanks, Mike. That was helpful. And then I guess for 4Q, as you kind of think about the expectations by segment, we've kind of discussed elective procedures within healthcare. You guys talked a little bit about safety and industrial, what's going on with math. But I think both consumer and T&E are facing tougher comps in the fourth quarter. Is the expectation that those businesses can still grow organically or is there a risk they could be down year-on-year?\nMonish Patolawala: So I would start with just Transportation Electronics, that business has impacted the most by two.One is the auto industry, and second is the electronics industry and the semiconductor shortages hits that business squarely. I would say on the auto build the latest IHS forecast that we look at is, on a year-over-year 20% down as where auto builds are expected to be.  There's also, they're facing comps from last year in the electronics side. So whether it's consumer electronics, TVs, tablets, all of them, are supposed to be down on a year-over-year basis. I think we'll have to see where semiconductor shortages land up for that business, but they're Ashish and team are fighting hard and if the volumes they're going to do whatever it takes to make sure that the customers are served.  On consumer, you're right, that's also facing a very strong comp from last year, but you can see what they -- what Jeff and team have done in the first 11 months. We have seen strong growth. Our platforms where it was command or Filtrete are posted notes, etc., all have seen good growth in the third quarter. We saw a good early start in our stationary business and the holiday season. The question is whether that continues is the thing that we'll have to keep watching.\nNicole DeBlase: Got it. Thanks. I'll pass it on.\nMonish Patolawala: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Tusa: Hi. Good morning.\nMonish Patolawala: Hi Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, guys. So what is like the underlying, like leverage this quarter? [inaudible 01:00:15] Back out price costs and then I think like the year-over-year on restructuring costs and savings and then temporary costs kind of mask things a little bit. But if I just -- if I kind of like back into what I'm getting something negative on the revenue growth. But then obviously there's the supply and that other inflation that you have to deal with. What is the underlying -- is the underlying leverage positive this quarter on that 5%? Or was it negative because of this, just have that out a little bit because a lot of moving parts here.\nMonish Patolawala: You're breaking up a little bit, Steve, but I think I got your question as what's the underlying leverage, and I would tell you it's a little hard for me to X everything out from a restructuring perspective. X out organic volume price raw and then give you a leverage. I would just tell you when you look at the bridge that we have given you, we did see volume growth, but that was offset by the productivity from global supply chain, as well as our growth in productivity and increased litigation costs.  And you can see that hurt us 1.4% on that productivity basis. That's the way I look at it Steve, it's very hard and I think it would be unfair for me to just X everything out and then tell you leverage is good because I don't think that's the way we look at it. Because for me it's -- ultimately it's the all-in, what I give you versus Xing stuff out.\nSteve Tusa: Right. I guess, is there a reason why you wouldn't be able to convert more normally in '22? I guess, assuming these things stabilize, is this business still a 35% core incremental margin business?\nMonish Patolawala: I would say so, Steve, I think it's a gain. You have to go back to all thing s being equal.\nMonish Patolawala: Yes, it's a 30 to 40% leverage business and I don't see that change. But I think it will come down to what does supply chain trends look like in 2022. You've seen not just us, but many of our peers as well as other people have said supply chain constraints go into 2022. But I think long term, as Mike has mentioned, and I have said, we are very confident we can grow about the macro. We can get margin expansion and we can continue to have strong cash. So all those, it's -- I think it's just a short uncertain time that we'll have to just see how supply chain self -- plays itself.\nSteve Tusa: Yeah. Yeah, very appreciated. Okay. Thanks. Thanks [inaudible 01:02:44]\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning.\nBruce Jermeland: Hey John.\nEveryone: Hi, John.\nJohn Walsh: Maybe just first question around the restructuring,you used the term on track,,but I just wanted to confirm the numbers here. I mean, the prior program was 275 million in Costs, 225 million of savings, and then now you've -- you've taken it obviously up higher here. How do we think of -- what is that -- is that you mean by on track, that's like an 82% conversion on the savings and on the new actions, how do we think about the payback on those?\nMonish Patolawala: So I'll reiterate and I'm -- our program was going to cost somewhere between 250 to 300 and benefits of somewhere between 200 and 250. What we have looked -- what I said in this, in my prepared remarks was year-to-date we have spent 240 million against the 250 to 300 and we are updating that from 250 to 300 to 300 to 325 and be largely expect the program to be initiated by the end of 1Q '22.  On the benefit side, we are -- we had set 200 to 250 with all the actions that we have taken. We see ourselves at the higher end of that range in between the 225 and the 250, but half of it that's already shown up or will show up for this year in '21 by the time we're done with the fourth quarter. And the balance would show up in '22.\nBruce Jermeland: Hey, John I just want to clarify one thing. Monish said year-to-date we've had $240 million of charges --\nMonish Patolawala: Charges, sorry,\nBruce Jermeland: That's actually a 140 last year in Q4 and 100 million year-to-date this year?\nMonish Patolawala: Yeah. Sorry. Program to-date.\nBruce Jermeland: Yeah.\nMonish Patolawala: And as you know, John, we don't remove restructuring charges from our results and that's all included in the numbers we report. So we don't adjust for that.\nJohn Walsh: Yes, no. Thank you for the [Indiscernible] extra details there. And then maybe just as a follow-up here, lot of questions around supply chain I think we're all following the semi shortages, etc.. But 3M, you also mentioned like probably propylene and some other supply chains that a little bit more ancillary to kind of semi and some of the things we might be tracking day-to-day. I'm assuming there was some impact there from either hurricanes first majeur, etc. Can you maybe just help us understand what you're seeing in that part of your supply chain?\nMonish Patolawala: Yeah. So --\nJohn Walsh: How long the duration of that might be.\nMonish Patolawala: So we're seeing polypropylene ethylene resins, all of the ones are the companies I mentioned seeing inflation. Many of these accrued better videos. They're not perfectly tied to the price of crude, but you can see where crude is going. So there's derivatives. T hey all have got impacted all the way in February, but the hurricane that happened. And then I would say the global supply chains have further put pressure on it for the material flow across the globe. And that makes it harder for you to buy material only in certain locations. And just -- I would, if my memory is right, on polypropylene and ethylene, we saw actually a jump in August. We've seen it come down a little bit in September.  But that's again, it's demand-supply equation there, but it's all goes back to Hurricane Ida that happened in February. And then the demand from the pandemic also increased the need for the product and all that put together, Mike used the word convergence, has driven some of the pressures on the chemical side of the house.\nJohn Walsh: Great. I appreciate you taking the questions.\nMonish Patolawala: Thanks, John.\nMike Roman: Thanks John.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, guys.\nEveryone: Morning.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Maybe an update on how you're thinking about cash deployment at this point. I think we all understand your priorities and they start with organic investments. But at what point do you ramp up purchases for instance, if your stock continues to languish at [Indiscernible], at what point do you think you've gone far enough into a salary integration that 3M might be better equipped to make a larger deal again?\nMonish Patolawala: Again, just I -- and my apologies, Andy, I am just going to reiterate our capital allocation priorities just so that everyone's on the same page. Our first priority is always go organic. We just see it's the best use of our capital, best return, as you can see, the not afraid to deploy capital. We've done that in 2020, We're continuing do that in '21, which is investing in growth, productivity, and sustainability.  We were going to spend $1.8 to $2 billion this year, but with some office supply chain constraints, it's down to 1.5 to 1.6, but we still believe in the long-term growth, and so we're going to keep investing in that. As Mike had announced early in the year, we also announced a billion dollars to improve -- for our sustainability efforts.  That's going to be spend over the next 20 years, but it's front-end loaded, so that's the second piece on organic investment. Dividend is our second priority, important for our shareholders. So that's a priority that we clearly are focused on. Our third priority is M&A, and you're right that we are integrating Acelity and the team's doing a very nice job by integrating Acelity into our business.  At the same time, we have tons of ideas and we have a pipeline that we'll execute when we see that we get a target that we believe can add value to our shareholders at the same time, it's things that we believe that, we can add value to the target too, by using some of the strengths that we have, which is our brand, our global capability, our employee base our material science capability, etc. So that's our third and we always have an active pipeline.  And then the last one, a share buyback. You've seen, we've now done 1.3 billion for the year. We did 527, that's the last priority for us from a deployment of capital perspective. But depending on the stock price and how much cash we generate, we clearly will look at that too. Overall, I would just save and I look at net debt to EBITDA leverage, which is at approximately 1.3. At that point, it gives me a lot of financial strength and optionality.  It gives 3M a lot of financial strength and optionality. So depending on what opportunities we see, we won't hesitate to deploy capital because, as Mike mentioned, even some of the platforms that we've talked about, all of them are GDP plus growth platform. So that's an area we would love to keep investing in.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Many sets [Indiscernible] Could you give us a little more color on what's going on in your Healthcare business in terms of margin. I think margin performance is relatively doing year-over-year,at least versus your other segments.  So how much is the Saudi integration helping? Is it a mix of your businesses such as oral care outperforming that's helping margin. And how are you thinking about margin trajectory in that business moving forward?\nMonish Patolawala: Yeah. So for healthcare, I also look at EBITDA, if that helps, Andy. I think year-to-date, we are approximately 31% on an EBITDA basis. The team most and team have done a really nice job of continuing to drive margin. We increased margin 70 basis points in the third quarter. I would say it's a performance all around the Oral Care business and the snapback has definitely helped. It helps us on a volume, it helps us on leverage with the volume and the factories. The MSD business, if you exclude the disposable respirator decline, grew very nicely in the second quarter and MSD's [inaudible 01:11:00] Acelity was in there too.  Acelity was impacted in the third quarter by low elective procedures, but the integration is going well, we're continuing to find synergies between the cross-selling that we can do with our wound care business and facility or existing wound care business and facility. So we are very happy with our progress. But in the spirit of continuous improvement, there's always more we can do to drive growth and margin and most in team are very focused on continuing to do that.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Appreciate in Monish.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie: Thank you. Thanks for fitting me in to everybody\nEveryone: [Indiscernible]\nJoe Ritchie: Maybe just on the price cost discussion, I haven't covered you guys for a while.It's rare to see that price cost equation negative,the question I have is, do you think we're at the peak of pain that a 140 basis points impact on price costs? And then my follow-on to that, Monish, you talked about some of your business being going through contracts. I'm just curious, what portion of your business is tougher to re-price in this environment?\nMonish Patolawala: So to answer your first question, we have made progress on price. You saw us going from 10 basis points to 140. And if you recall, Joe, we had said that, you will see this ramp through the year, because we take a very methodical approach to driving price across the multiple geographies and the channels, we have. We should continue to see progress in the fourth quarter as these price actions that we've taken in the third quarter continue to take hold. I think the big issue that we have seen as inflation is coming faster than anybody thought. And so the team has continuously done what it can to drive price increases to the question that was even asked earlier, our goal is to get to neutral of price and all. But I think it'll all depend on how inflation goes. But the team knows how to drive price, the team drives a lot of innovation that also helps from a price increase perspective. So all that put together teams working it pretty hard.\nJoe Ritchie: And the question on the contract,in being able to reprice some of your contract,you have some kind of benchmark for us on what portion is a little bit tougher to reprice in the environment?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. Listen, all price increases we work with our customers. We have contracts with many of our customers, in some cases we get 90 to a 120 days notice. In some cases, these are longer contracts that we worked through. And then we have spec in businesses that we work directly with the OEM. So put all that together, that's how we look at this. So it's hard for me to give you one number because, pick a day and I think you'll have a different dollar of contract on the contract quote and quote.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.\nMonish Patolawala: Thanks too\nMike Roman: Thanks too\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\nBruce Jermeland: To wrap up, our team is performing well in a challenging environment, delivering broad-based growth, good margins, and strong cash flow. We will stay focused on managing supply chain constraints, investing in attractive market trends to drive our growth and creating greater value for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

Welcome to the 3M Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, July 27, 2021.  I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland: Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments, then we will take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Please turn to Slide 2. As we have done throughout the year, I would like to remind you to mark your calendars for our next earnings call, which will take place on Tuesday, October 26. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note, throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release. Please turn to Slide 4, and I'll now hand it off to Mike. Mike?\nMike Roman : Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. 3M's performance in the second quarter was strong as we posted organic growth across all business groups and geographic areas. Our team executed well and delivered increased earnings, expanded margins and robust cash flow.  From a macro perspective, the global economy continues to improve, though uncertainty remains due to COVID-19 and heightened concern over the increase in Delta variant cases. We saw ongoing strength in many end markets, including home improvement, oral care and general industrial, along with a pickup in health care elective procedures. We continue to work to mitigate ongoing inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges as well as end market dynamics such as the semiconductor shortage impacting automotive build rates and electronics. We are also beginning to see a decline in pandemic-related demand for disposable respirators, which I will discuss on the next slide. Looking forward, we will stay focused on investing in emerging growth opportunities, improving productivity and advancing sustainability. We are confident in our ability to continue executing well in the face of COVID-19 uncertainties and are raising our full year guidance for organic growth to 6% to 9%, and earnings per share to $9.70 to $10.10. Please turn to Slide 5. In the second quarter, we delivered total sales of $8.9 billion. We posted organic growth of 21% versus a 13% decline in last year's second quarter, along with earnings of $2.59 per share. We expanded adjusted EBITDA margins to over 27% and increased adjusted free cash flow to $1.6 billion with a conversion rate of 103%. Strong cash flow allowed us to further strengthen our balance sheet while returning $1.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. I am proud of our team's execution in a dynamic environment. We are finding new ways to innovate for customers and improve our operational performance. In addition to our strong day-to-day execution, we are investing to capitalize on favorable market trends and serve emerging customer needs. I want to share a few impactful examples. In Health Care, our innovative Prevena therapy Incision Management System is the first and only medical device indicated by the U.S. FDA to help reduce surgical site infections in high-risk patients, helping lower the costly financial burden of complications, delivering on both improved clinical outcomes and cost savings for the health care system. In automotive electrification, we are building on 3M's long history in consumer electronics and now expanding our solutions for the future of transportation, including new display technologies for both electric and internal combustion engines, helping us drive above-market growth in our automotive business. In home improvement, we are building out a suite of innovations to help consumers personalize their homes, including our fast-growing line of Command damage-free hanging solutions, $500 million franchise that leverages our world-class adhesive platform with even greater opportunities ahead. We have increased opportunities across our businesses to apply 3M science and drive long-term growth, and we will continue to invest and win in those areas. As you all have seen, the ongoing impact of COVID-19 is highly variable across geographies. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have increased our annual respirator production fourfold to $2.5 billion by activating idle surge capacity and building additional lines, while shifting 90% of distribution into health care to protect nurses, doctors and first responders. One of our strengths is to quickly adapt to changing marketplace needs. Global demand reached its peak in Q1 of this year, which included stockpiling from governments and hospitals. We are now seeing a now seeing a deceleration in overall health care demand and our adjusting production, increasing supply to industrial and consumer channels while continuing to prioritize health care workers in the geographies seeing increased COVID-19 cases and elevated hospitalization rates. As we do this, we are reducing overall output to meet end-market trends. Like we have in the past, we are prepared to rapidly increase production in response to COVID-19-related needs or future emergencies when needed. As I reflect on the first half, I am pleased with our performance. We delivered strong sales and margin growth, along with good cash flow while building for the future and advancing sustainability with significant new carbon, water and plastic commitments. In the second half, in addition to investing in growth, productivity and sustainability, we also must navigate ongoing COVID-19 impacts and continue taking actions to address inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. We will do this by driving an unrelenting focus on operational performance, which includes improving service, quality, operating costs and cash generation. I would like to thank 3Mers for your commitment and resilience as we bring together people, ideas and science to help transform businesses, solve customer challenges, and improve lives around the world. That wraps up my opening comments, and I'll turn it over to Monish to cover more details on the quarter and our updated guidance. Monish?\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 6. Company-wide, second quarter sales were $8.9 billion, up 25% year-on-year or an increase of 21% on an organic basis. Sales growth, combined with operating rigor and disciplined cost management, drove adjusted operating income of $2 billion, up 40%, with adjusted operating margins of 22%, up 240 basis points year-on-year. Second quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings per share were $2.59, up 44% compared to last year's adjusted results. On this slide, you can see the components that impacted both operating margins and earnings per share as compared to Q2 last year. A strong year-on-year organic volume growth, along with ongoing productivity, restructuring efforts and other items, added 4.1 percentage points to operating margins and $0.89 to earnings per share year-on-year. Included in this margin and earnings benefit were a few items of note. First, during the quarter, the Brazilian Supreme Court issued a ruling that clarified the calculation of Brazil's federal sales-based social tax, essentially lowering the social tax that 3M should have paid in prior years. This favorable ruling added $91 million to operating income or 1 percentage points to operating margins and $0.12 to earnings per share. Next, as you will see later today in our 10-Q, we increased our other environmental liability by nearly $60 million and our respiratory liabilities by approximately $20 million as part of our regular review. In addition, we also incurred a year-on-year increase in ongoing legal defense costs. We are currently scheduled to begin a PFAS-related trial in Michigan in October, along with the next step in the Combat Arms Earplug multidistrict litigation, with one trial in September and one in October. And finally, during the second quarter, we incurred a pretax restructuring charge of approximately $40 million as part of the program we announced in Q4 of last year. Second quarter net selling price and raw materials performance reduced both operating margins and earnings per share by 140 basis points and $0.17, respectively. This headwind was larger than forecasted as we experienced broad-based cost increases for chemicals, resins, outsourced manufacturing and logistics as the quarter progressed. As a result of these increasing cost trends, we now forecast a full year raw materials and logistics cost headwind in the range of $0.65 to $0.80 per share versus a prior expectation of $0.30 to $0.50. As we have discussed, we have been and are taking multiple actions including increasing selling prices to address these cost headwinds. As a result, we expect continued improvement in our selling price performance in the second half of the year. However, given the pace of cost increases, we currently expect a third quarter net selling price and raw materials headwind to margins in the range of 50 to 100 basis points, which we anticipate will turn to a net benefit in the fourth quarter as our selling price and other actions start catching up to the increased costs. Moving to divestiture impacts. The lost income from the sale of drug delivery in May of last year was a headwind of 10 basis points to operating margins and $0.02 to earnings per share. Foreign currency, net of hedging impacts, reduced margins 20 basis points while benefiting earnings by $0.08 per share.  Finally, 3 non-operating items combined had a net neutral impact to earnings per share year-on-year. This result included a $0.06 earnings benefit from lower other expenses, that was offset by higher tax rate and diluted share count, which were each a headwind of $0.03 per share versus last year. Please turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. We delivered another quarter of robust free cash flow with second quarter adjusted free cash flow of $1.6 billion, up 2% year-on-year, along with conversion of 103%. Our year-on-year free cash flow performance was driven by strong double-digit growth in sales and income, which was mostly offset by a timing of an income tax payment of approximately $400 million in last year's Q3, which is traditionally paid in Q2. Through the first half of the year, we increased adjusted free cash flow to $3 billion versus $2.5 billion last year. Second quarter capital expenditures were $394 million and approximately $700 million year-to-date. For the full year, we are currently tracking to the low end of our expected CapEx range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion, given vendor constraints and the pace of capital projects. During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $858 million and share repurchases of $503 million. Year-to-date, we have returned $2.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Our strong cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to strengthen our capital structure. We ended the quarter with $12.7 billion in net debt, a reduction of $3.5 billion since the end of Q2 last year. As a result, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio has declined from 1.9 a year ago to 1.3 at the end of Q2. Our net debt position, along with our strong cash flow generation capability, continues to provide us financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities and return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure. Please turn to Slide 8, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q2. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted organic growth of 18% year-on-year in the second quarter, driven by improving industrial manufacturing activity and prior pandemic impacts. First, starting with our personal safety business, we posted double-digit organic growth in our head, face, gearing and fall protection solutions as demand in general industrial and construction end markets remains strong. However, this growth was more than offset by a decline in our overall respiratory portfolio due to last year's strong COVID-related demand resulting in an organic sales decline of low single-digits for our personal safety business. Within our respiratory portfolio, second quarter disposable respirator sales increased 3% year-on-year but declined 11% sequentially as COVID-related hospitalizations declined. Looking ahead, we anticipate continued deceleration in disposable respirator demand through the balance of this year and into 2022. Turning to the rest of Safety and Industrial. Organic growth was broad-based, led by double-digit increases in automotive aftermarket, roofing granules, abrasives, adhesives and tapes and electrical markets. Safety and Industrial's second quarter operating income was $718 million, up 15% versus last year. Operating margins were 22.1%, down 130 basis points year-on-year as leverage on sales growth was more than offset by increases in raw materials, logistics and ongoing legal costs. Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which grew 24% organically despite sustained challenges from semiconductor supply chain constraints. Organic growth was led by our auto OEM business, up 76% year-on-year compared to a 49% increase in global car and light truck builds. This outperformance was due to several factors. First, the regional mix of year-on-year growth in car and light truck builds were in regions where we have high dollar content per vehicle. Second, a year-on-year increase in sell-in of 3M products versus the change in build rate. Lastly, we continue to apply 3M innovation to vehicles, gaining penetration onto new platforms. Our electronics-related business was up double digits organically, with continued strength in semiconductor, factory automation and data centers, along with consumer electronic devices, namely tablets and TVs. Looking ahead, we continue to monitor the global semiconductor supply chain and its potential impact on the electronics and automotive industries. Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Advanced materials, commercial solutions and transportation safety each grew double digits year-on-year. Second quarter operating income was $546 million, up over 50% year-on-year. Operating margins were 22%, up 340 basis points year-on-year driven by strong leverage on sales growth, which was partially offset by increases in raw materials and logistic costs. Turning to our Health Care business, which delivered second quarter organic sales growth of 23%. Organic growth was driven by continued year-on-year and sequential improvements in health care elective procedure volumes as COVID-related hospitalizations decline. Our medical solutions business grew mid-teens organically or up approximately 20%, excluding the decline in disposable respirator demand. I am pleased with the performance of Acelity, which grew nearly 20% organically in the quarter as it helps us build on our leadership in advanced wound care. Sales in our oral care business more than doubled from a year ago as patient visits have nearly returned to pre-COVID levels. The separation and purification business increased 10% year-on-year due to ongoing demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccine and therapeutics, along with improving demand for water filtration solutions. Health Information Systems grew high single digits, driven by strong growth in clinician solutions. And finally, food safety increased double digits organically as food safety activity returns, along with continued strong growth from new product introduction. Health Care's second quarter operating income was $576 million, up over 90% year-on-year. Operating margins were 25.3%, up 880 basis points. Second quarter margins were driven by leverage on sales growth, which was partially offset by increasing raw materials and logistics costs, along with increased investments in growth. Lastly, second quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was 18% year-on-year with strong sell-in and sell-out trends across most retail channels.  Our home improvement business continues to perform well, up high teens organically on top of a strong comparison from a year ago. This business continued to experience strong demand in many of our category-leading franchises, particularly Command, Filtrete and Meguiar's.  Stationery and office grew strong double-digits organically in Q2 as this business laps last year's cohort related comparisons. We continue to see strength in consumer demand for Scotch branded packaging and shipping products, along with improved sell-in trends in Post-it Solutions and Scotch branded home and office tapes as retailers prepare for back-to-school and return to work please. Our Home Care business was up low single digits organically versus last year's strong COVID-driven comparison. And finally, our Consumer Health and Safety business was up double-digits as we lap COVID-related impacts from a year ago, along with improved supply of safety products for our retail customers. Consumer's operating income was $311 million, up 12% year-on-year. Operating margins were 21%, down 160 basis points as increased costs for raw materials, logistics and outsourced hard goods manufacturing, along with investments in advertising and merchandising more than offset leverage from sales growth. Please turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of our full year 2021 guidance. While uncertainty remains, we expect global economic and end market growth to remain strong. However, continue to be fluid as the world wrestles with ongoing COVID-related impacts that we all see and monitor. Therefore, there are a number of items that will need to be navigated as we go through the second half of the year. For example, we anticipate continued sequential improvement in health care elective procedure volumes. Also, we expect ongoing strength in the home improvement market and currently anticipate students returning to classrooms and more people returning to the workplace. Next, we remain focused on driving innovation and penetration with our global auto OEM and electronics customers. These 2 end markets continue to converge as highlighted by the well-known constraints in semiconductor chip supply. This limited chip supply is expected to reduce year-on-year automotive and electronics production volumes in the second half. As mentioned earlier, we expect demand for disposable respirators to wane and negatively impact second half revenues by approximately $100 million to $300 million year-on-year. Turning to raw materials and logistics. As noted, we anticipate a year-on-year earnings headwind of $0.65 to $0.80 per share for the full year or $0.40 to $0.55 in the second half due to rising cost pressures. We are taking a number of actions, including broad-based selling price increases to help mitigate this headwind. And finally, the restructuring program we announced last December remains on track. As part of this program, we expect to incur a pretax charge in the range of $60 million to $110 million in the second half of this year. Thus, taking into account our first half performance, along with these factors, we are raising our full year guidance for both organic growth and earnings per share. Organic growth is estimated to be 6% to 9%, up from the previous range of 3% to 6%. We now anticipate earnings of $9.70 to $10.10 per share against a prior range of $9.20 to $9.70. Also, as you can see, we now expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 90% to 100% versus a prior range of 95% to 105%. This adjustment is primarily due to ongoing challenges in global supply chains, raw materials and logistics, which are expected to persist for some time. Turning to the third quarter, let me highlight a few items of note. First, we currently anticipate continued improvement in health care elective procedure volumes across most parts of the world. Global smartphone shipments are expected to be down high single digits year-on-year, while global car and light truck builds, I expect to be down 3% year-on-year. Relative to disposable respirators, we anticipate a year-on-year reduction in sales of $50 million to $100 million due to continued decline in global demand. As mentioned earlier, we are anticipating a third quarter year-on-year operating margin headwind of 50 basis points to 100 basis points from selling prices, net of higher raw materials and logistic costs. On the restructuring front, which I previously discussed, we expect a Q3 pretax charge in the range of $50 million to $75 million as a part of this program. And finally, we expect higher investments in growth productivity and sustainability in the quarter, along with higher legal defense costs as proceedings progress. To wrap up, our team has delivered a strong first half performance, including broad-based growth, good operational execution, robust cash flows and an enhanced capital structure. With that being said, there's always more we can do and will do. We continue to prioritize capital to our greatest opportunities for growth, productivity and sustainability, while remaining focused on delivering for our customers, improving operating rigor and enhancing daily management. I want to thank our customers and vendors for their ongoing loyalty and partnership and especially our employees for their dedication, perseverance and execution in these uncertain times.  With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Good morning, Mike and Monish. I'm on Slide 13 in the appendix, just looking at the price data. And based on my notes, price was up about, I think, 70 basis points last quarter. It looks like 10 basis points this quarter, but the real headwind was Asia Pacific. What -- can you give us a little color into kind of -- I know some of this might be mix. So what's impacting the price dynamic, perhaps there's some comp issues to there. So I'll just leave it at that.\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. Sure, Scott. It's a great question. And you're right. But as I first said, we are raising prices everywhere. It's taking a little bit of time, but it's broad-based. You've seen what we have said we'll do in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. To answer your question specifically on the second quarter, you hit on one point, which is a comp issue from year-over-year but the second piece of this was also as the volumes came in pretty strong in the second quarter, we had some rebates that get accounted for with that extra volume, and that drove it. But when you reflect on the guide that we gave you, price pretty much came in where we had thought. It's just slightly lower than that. So we were expecting this.\nScott Davis: Okay. And then was there a supply chain impact on sales, an explicit supply chain impact on sales that held back sales? Or was it more just a cost logistics issue?\nMonish Patolawala: I would say, Scott, it's really hard to figure out exactly what the impact was. There definitely was an impact, I would say, in general, in the larger market and 3M was no different where supply constraints were there. The team has done a marvelous job of trying to keep the factories running the best they can and making sure we are taking care of our customers as quickly as we can. So I would say there were more inefficiencies that we have had to deal with just as raw material was not as fluid as we would have thought through this process. But overall, we have done our best to keep our customers whole through this process. But this is an ongoing piece, Scott, that we'll have to watch how the second half plays itself out. You're seeing not only us but end markets also getting impacted by some of the raw material shortages, and we're just going to keep working this as we go through the second half.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nJoseph Ritchie: Can you guys talk a little bit about the durability in the Health Care margins? Impressive back to 25% this quarter, I'm just wondering if this is now kind of like a baseline going forward. We're back to kind of like the 2019-ish type levels.\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. I think, Joe, that's a great question. I think we also keep looking at that all the time. I would just start with the team has done a really nice job of continuing to drive margins up while still investing in the business. The sharp increase on a year-over-year basis is driven by a lot of the volume increase that you saw Q2 of last year versus Q2 of this year. Third, I would say the volume leverage has helped, but we still got hurt by raw materials and logistics costs, and we continue to invest in the business. I would -- to answer your specific question on what does it look like going forward, I think it all comes down to ultimately where does volume turn out to be? As I said in my prepared remarks that disposable respirators are starting to slow down. You're seeing a Q3 impact of $50 million to $100 million on a year-over-year basis and $100 million to $300 million for the second half. Some -- many -- most of that should hit the Health Care segment. So we'll see where volume plays itself out. But secondly, I think is how much investments we keep driving as we see hospitalizations increase and elective procedures go up. So I think it's going to be a trade between that. Overall, I would say the team and I, we all believe in continuous improvement. So we're going to keep driving productivity continuing to reduce cost, investing where we think it's the right place to invest and driving efficiency in SG&A as much as we can.\nJoseph Ritchie: Maybe just following up on that, it is helpful to have that context. As I think about just the Health Care business, right, you did mention that elective procedures have increased and perhaps maybe that's going to offset some of the respirator issue. Should we think of that as being mix-accretive? If, in fact, elective procedures are increasing and are potentially offsetting the weakness in respirators?\nMonish Patolawala: I would tell you, I think the way we got to think about it is, as electives go up, we don't have a one-for-one perfect connection between electives. So it depends on which piece of the demand goes up, Joe. So it's really hard to give you the perfect answer on whether it's mix or not. What I generally believe is as elective procedures go up and as volume picks up, you will see us getting more leverage because of that. How much the disposable respirator volume goes down and where it comes from will also have an impact. So it's a hard one for me to quantify exactly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Just want to say that Slide 9 is especially helpful with all the moving parts, your assumptions for the year and assumptions for the third quarter. So I appreciate all those specifics. And my first question is on capital allocation. You got the balance sheet in good shape, 1.3x net leverage. You did restart buybacks, but still share count looked -- looks like it increased. Why would you not be doing more buybacks here? And can we start there, please?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. Sure, Deane. As I told you, from our priority of capital allocation, our first priority is always investing organically between R&D and CapEx because we think that's the biggest return for our money. The second is dividend. You've seen we have increased dividend. It's 63rd year in a row that dividend is up. It matters to our shareholders. That's our second priority. Our third priority is M&A, and we will normally do M&A in the area where we believe that the target that we're going to acquire can benefit from being a part of 3M. Right now, we are busy integrating Acelity, and the team is doing a nice job integrating that. So we don't see any acquisitions of the size of Acelity in the near future, but we have an active pipeline of a number of things. And then our last discretionary use of capital allocation is share buyback. So for the year, year-to-date, we have done $700 million, give or take. And I would say share buyback and continued share back depends on what the volume is going to be, depends on the needs of future capital in uses that we have as well as what the cash flow that we generate will depend on that. So I would say, we'll keep you posted during these quarterly calls as we continue this program and decide how much we do.\nDeane Dray: Terrific. And then just as a follow-up, given all the changes, it seems like day-to-day in the macro, any commentary about how July has started, especially regionally would be helpful here?\nMike Roman : Yes, Dean, I would say, I start with the expectation that the team is going to continue to execute well as we go into the second half of the year. And we've talked about some of the dynamics. Monish outlined a number that we're seeing. I would say, so far, no surprises as we start the first few weeks of July. We are expecting the global macroeconomic and end market strength to continue. It will remain fluid. We talked about the uncertainties as we look into the second half. We expect and are seeing continued increase in elective procedures in health care, home improvement, expected to remain strong. Industrial, more broadly, generally improving as we go in the second half. We talked about it in the first half, we saw broad-based growth across geographies, and we expect this to continue it. The uncertainty there is COVID and the impact on any increases in cases and hospitalizations. There are certainly some areas around the world where we're seeing that. And even as we talk about the decline in respirator -- disposable respirator demand globally, we're seeing areas that we are increasing supply. And so that's going to be one of the things that can impact second half geographically across the world. So we -- while we expect overall pandemic-related respirator demand to decline, we expect some areas we'll see stronger demand as COVID plays out. So that gives you a little bit of a view of how we look around the world second half.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse.\nJohn Walsh: Maybe just for the first one, a clarification. I wanted to know if you could give us an order of magnitude of what you're looking at in terms of price increases that you plan to put through across the product portfolio and obviously, understand it will probably vary by product line. And then second question is, if I look at your kind of organic growth, kind of the same growth-on-growth in Q2 as Q1. Was curious if you have any commentary around customer channel inventory? And if you're seeing any change in behavior there?\nMike Roman : Yes, John, I would say price -- our teams are focused, as Monish talked about, on taking price in the second half to help us offset what we're seeing in inflation. And that's fairly broad-based. We -- it takes -- as we talked about, it takes some time to implement price changes and get ahead of inflation and it's been -- inflation has been an ongoing challenge as we've gone through the year. So we're expecting to see stronger price broad-based as we get into the second half and into fourth quarter, we start to see a price raw positive impact. And if you look at where our channel inventories today, this is something we're always asking ourselves. It's a dynamic that we are continuously measuring and assessing every region in the world. And I would say, given the dynamics in the marketplace, the snapback in the economy, the fluid and uneven market dynamics, it's difficult to know what the right level is today. We get visibility on where our sell-in and sell-out is. With that snapback in demand, it's hard to get clear visibility on levels -- appropriate levels of inventory. There are some areas, of course, that are very visible, the ongoing semiconductor chip shortages, and they're impacting production volumes, and we are -- we see our inventory in the channel aligning with that. We've talked quite a bit about the visibility we're putting on N95 respirators specifically. But beyond that, it's really going to depend on how demand plays out in each market to really get a view as we go through third quarter of where inventory in the channel sets.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: I just wanted to try and circle back to the Safety and Industrial outlook. I suppose it's possible if we look at Q4 that your sales in that segment could be down year-on-year in aggregate because of respirators. Just wondered any perspectives on that? And also, the margin implication in 2020, your S&I margins were up a good amount. Q2, they're softer, I think, sequentially and year-on-year as the respirator business rolls over. So should we expect that sort of mix headwind to play out for a few more quarters?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. I think, Julian, it's a great question on Safety and Industrial. So to answer your specific question first on the impact, could it be negative on a year-over-year basis? As we said, and just a reminder, in 2019, we used to have revenue approximately $600 million of disposable respirators that went up to $1.4 billion in 2020. And as I look at the second half, we told you there could be a risk of $100 million to $300 million, which is the range of where we think disposable respirator volume would come down on a year-over-year basis. And if we go to that higher end of the range, which is $300 million, yes, the answer is you could definitely see negative volumes. What we have been doing as a part of this as health care demand has waned due to lower hospitalizations due to COVID and increase in electives is we have been moving production out from the hospital channel to different parts, which is industrial and governments, which we are actively doing. The other piece of Safety and Industrial is, as I mentioned in Q2, we have seen growth in quite a few other segments of Safety and Industrial, whether it's in our respiratory portfolio with our safety portfolio, with head and face masks, whether you've seen us increase in our abrasive business, in our adhesives business, our roofing granules. So all the other segments, automotive aftermarket, have seen increase. And depending on how the economy plays itself out, and as long as industrial activity continues, you should see continued growth in those areas. And our current assumption is that long term, those markets will come back. I think it's going to be a little fluid in the second half, depending on how COVID plays itself out. To answer your second question on margin, you're right, as we have seen in 2019 versus '20, we did get benefited a lot by the volume leverage that we got across Safety and Industrial. So ultimately, where volume lands in the second half will have an impact on where margins ultimately go. We are actively working on price increases, broad-based in that segment. It's -- how much of that is offset by price and raws and logistics cost is the second offset. And the third one is the ongoing legal fees or reserves that we have taken, will be the third one. And then the last one I would say is what do we invest in growth, productivity and sustainability and especially growth, because as industrial activity goes up in '22 and '23, we're going to continue to invest in that segment. So put all that together, that's how we see where margins are going to land.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan.\nStephen Tusa: Can you just maybe talk about, other than the mask headwind kind of sequentially, do you expect the kind of auto stuff -- like what else is getting worse sequentially, kind of when we think about 3 to 4 -- 3Q and 4Q trends?\nMonish Patolawala: So Steve, I would say, I would just put everything in the context of back to end markets, in total, we feel will remain strong. I think you're going to see volatility as we get through the second half with what happens with COVID. So a couple of items to note. We believe that elective procedures will continue to go up quarter-over-quarter. But in some parts of the world, you could see it go down. Secondly, I would say auto does show an increase. It's still on a year-over-year headwind, down 3% in the third quarter. And if my memory is right, it's projected to be down 3.7% in the fourth quarter. I think the semiconductor shortages will have an impact on what happens there, and we'll see where that plays itself out. Smartphone shipments are supposed to be down on a year-over-year basis. We'll see where it lands sequentially. And then tablets and TVs, which also were benefited tremendously last year, are also projected to be down on a year-over-year basis, but hard to quantify what exactly it looks like on a sequential basis. You have seen us -- you have seen a pretty good increase in stationery and office supply in the second quarter. That momentum is there right now, where we are seeing sell-in trends as retailers are planning to have people -- more people return to the workplace, kids in school, but depending on how the pandemic plays out, that could have an impact. And then on Safety and Industrial, as I mentioned in the prior question, I think there's an assumption that industrial activity continues. But currently, the supply chain shortages across the world also put a lot of variability onto what that demand looks like. And that's why when we put all that together, we said we are prudent to call the year at 6% to 9% for the year versus the 3% to 6% that we had said earlier. But overall, I -- go ahead.\nStephen Tusa: I guess at the high end of the range, I think first half to second half, sales are down, which makes sense because of the mask dynamic. And normally, seasonally, I think they\u2019re down in the 4Q from a modestly up 3Q versus 2Q. But I guess is there anything this year seasonally, i.e. kind of the semi shortages kind of pushing demand to be a little bit better seasonally sequentially? You're kind of saying there's a lot of moving parts and like. So it's kind of normal seasonality and then including kind of the masks?\nMonish Patolawala: That's right, Steve. There is a lot of variability. But we'll keep you posted in there. Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Yes. So on the raw mats, Monish, based on your FICO convention and food purchasing, et cetera, when do you expect commodity inflation to peak? I don't know whether that's on a year-over-year basis or whether that's on a sequential basis, but when do you expect to see the peak in those raw mats?\nMonish Patolawala: So if you're asking specifically on commodities, I think it's a really hard one to call. For example, I would tell you, when we first gave our guide of $0.30 to $0.50, which has now been guided to $0.65 to $0.80, I would tell you, what we have seen is a broad-based increase in all commodities, whether it is polypropylene, chemical, resins we are seeing in our outsourced manufacturing goods, not just the labor cost, but other commodities that go into that also getting passed. And then logistics cost has continued to be a pretty strong headwind. Where that will peak? I think, in my view -- and I may be wrong here -- at some point, demand and supply need to start settling itself out. There's a lot of demand, there's not enough supply based on all the V-shape recovery with the congestion in the ports, et cetera. And until that stabilizes itself out, I think we are going to continue to see inflation. We have seen where crude prices have gone up much heavier than we had thought coming into the year. Polypropylene has remained strong or heavy, inflationary. Ocean rates have gone up a lot in the last 3 to 6 months. So it's really hard for us to come back and say, when does it peak and when it start coming down. So we've taken what we know. We have put in all the factors that we know. We've had a prediction of where we think these things could go. And we have come up with $0.65 to $0.80, which currently is our best guide of where we think inflation is going to be. But with that said, as I've mentioned, we are taking broad-based price increases everywhere to help offset the mitigation of this. We are also increasing yield. We are working with our suppliers to reduce prices, et cetera. And then in -- so third quarter, we'll see a headwind of 50 to 100 basis points price versus raw. And in the fourth quarter, our anticipation is that we should be able to get it to be flat to positive, which means price will offset the raw material inflation.\nNigel Coe: Okay. That's really helpful explanation. I think I'll stick with you here on the second half outlook. You're calling out legal costs, legal defense costs in the second half of the year. You didn't give a number around that. So I'm assuming it's not that material, but how do you think about just the magnitude of that in the back half? I'm just concerned if defense costs are not settlements necessarily. I'm thinking here about the earplug litigation and also Hoosick Falls settlement that you just announced?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So I think the first one that the Hoosick Falls settlement was a part of our reserve. So that was a part of the calculus already. I would say we will -- we are -- it's ongoing litigation. If you look at all the SEC material that we file as well as the Q that will get filed later on the day, should give you an update of all the cases. But just for your benefit, we got a PFAS case coming up in the October of this year. It's with Wolverine and the use of PFAS in there, and we've got 2 Combat Arm trials coming up. So as we prepare for those cases, that's the increased cost in legal fees. And what I would tell you is we will spend what is required to defend ourselves as we go through these cases and that's what the cost is being incurred for.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Just a sort of longer-term question. I think, historically, 3M has very strong position in terms of sort of global capacity in your key technologies. How do you think about sort of global nonwoven capacity post COVID? And are you seeing emergence of new players? Does it change sort of strategic landscape for 3M vis-\u00e0-vis players, particularly players out of Asia longer term?\nMike Roman : Yes. Thanks, Andrew. We -- as I highlighted in my prepared remarks, we saw probably the peak of demand, at least near term, in Q1. And we -- as you know, we built additional capacity as we went through 2020. By the end of the year, we were at a run rate of 2.5 billion N95 respirators on an annual basis. And so that's the capacity we come into the year. Other manufacturers build capacity as well to respond to the pandemic. And I think you see some of them idling some of their capacity as demand comes off the peak. And we'll begin that process as well to idle lines to be ready for the next emergency or changes in COVID-19. I mean, we can ramp up quickly. So our strategy is to be in a position to be a leader in personal safety, personal protective equipment in normal times, and that's really serving the broader industrial markets, serving consumer markets, serving health care markets, and that's our strategy for where we manufacture and the volumes. And then we have that idle capacity so we can surge in times of emergency. I think we're in a better position than ever before globally to be able to respond to a pandemic. And I would add, it's been good to see governments following through on their commitments to stockpile. That's something that we have a number of efforts underway around the world that we're supporting as we come through the first half of the year. So that, I think, prepares the world better for the next emergency, the next pandemic. So it's going to -- it will depend. When you look at where are we going to end up with respirator demand? We think we'll end up somewhere above where we were pre-pandemic. As use and protocols are changing around the world, we'll be well aligned to serve that. Our brand will be strong. We've got a leading brand position in PPE and can -- and really take advantage of that position around the world. And so I think we've got the model well aligned. I think there's a surge capacity that will be available. How much will depend both on the demand that comes in any kind of future emergency. And I think we're -- like I said, we're ready for our part of that.\nAndrew Obin: I guess my question was sort of broader and longer term. A lot of this technology is used air filters, automotive, and I was just wondering if you expect this incremental capacity that was brought on by your competitors to go into these industrial adjacencies and generate just more global competition. That was the question actually.\nMike Roman : Yes, Andrew, I can speak about us. I mean we are -- our nonwoven capacity, we do leverage that and utilize that in other areas, other products that we have like air filtration. So it is an opportunity for us that even with the capacity that we've built to be -- respond to the pandemic, we can take advantage of that and use that in other areas. And that's something that we're able to do broadly. We take our technologies and find innovative uses for them and air filtration is one of those. Will others do that? I'm sure there will be a focus in other markets for some of that capacity around the world. How much? I don't know how to give you a view of that perspective. The world will continue to grow, and we see trends in personal safety, air filtration. So the demand is going to continue to grow. So to some degree, it will -- the demand -- the capacity will grow into the demand as we go forward over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank.\nNicole DeBlase: So you always give kind of helpful color by geography, and there's been a lot of noise about things kind of falling down in China with respect to a lot of different pieces of macro data. Can you guys just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in China across your businesses?\nMike Roman : Sure, Nicole. I -- like I highlighted for the broader business, we saw broad-based growth, double-digit growth in our Transportation and Electronics, our Safety and Industrial and our Health Care businesses. Consumer was up mid-single-digits as we came through the quarter. And our growth was led by general industrial, some of the segments that are growing there, including our abrasives portfolio. Auto, OEM had strong growth and electronics. It's an important market for us. It's 10% of our total revenue. It grew over 20% in the first half. Last year, second quarter, we saw 3% growth. So China recovered, if you remember, ahead of other regions around the world. And when you look at the second half, comparisons start to get a little more challenging. And so we're expecting just year-over-year comps, I would say, we expect to see a little more challenge there. We still see opportunities for growth across our businesses in some of the same areas that we've highlighted on a global basis. Automotive will continue to be a focus, penetrating with the OEMs there. And we see -- even though it's our smallest business, we see significant opportunities to serve Chinese consumers through our consumer business, especially in areas like air and water quality. So it's -- we see opportunities, maybe a more challenging year-over-year comp, but still opportunities for growth.\nNicole DeBlase: Got it. Thanks, Mike. And if I could just follow-up on the second half margin outlook. There's clearly a lot of moving pieces here with legal costs, growth investments, price cost. Maybe just to boil it down, do you guys still expect to kind of be in that 30% to 40% incremental margin range in 3Q and 4Q?\nMonish Patolawala: So I would just say, Nicole, volume is the biggest driver that gives us leverage. So I think that's step #1 with all the volatility, the uncertainty that's out there. The question is where does second half volumes land as well as we've given you the range on disposable respirators are going to be down $100 million to $300 million on a year-over-year basis. The team continues to drive operating rigor so driving productivity and efficiency across the supply chain. We are going after price increases, and our anticipation is that in the fourth quarter, we should be able to offset the price -- the raw and logistics cost impact. So I would boil it down to saying what margin will come down to in the second half and what incrementals are, will depend on the volume, will depend on our ability to offset the price -- the raw and logistics pressure through price increase, continued productivity and good execution by the 3M team. And then finally, our decision on how much we're going to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability, plus a lot of these indirects that start snapping back, as hopefully, people start traveling. You've seen we've been very disciplined in the first half of making sure that we didn't spend ahead of what volumes come back. But as we see volumes coming back in, you're going to see those indirect start snapping back up. And then the last one is the legal fees and continuing to do what we think is right to protect ourselves as these cases go through. So that's all the factors that will ultimately impact what the incrementals are going to be.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.\nEitan Buchbinder: This is Eitan Buchbinder on for Andy Kaplowitz. Priority growth platforms delivered 10% growth in Q1. Can you update on how the group performed in Q2 as well as your outlook for the faster-growing businesses in the back half of the year?\nMike Roman : Yes, Eitan. The priority growth platforms also had strong growth. We talked about it in Q1, second quarter as well. So overall, they were up over 40% in second quarter. Now over $500 million in revenue as a group. And I highlighted a couple of other areas of our businesses that are seeing strong sequential growth and market dynamics that are attractive. So these priority growth platforms broadly are in attractive market spaces. Part of that priority investment in growth that we've been talking about even as we came through 2020, staying focused and aggressively investing in growth areas and PGPs, as we call them, the priority growth platforms, continue to be an important part and performing well.\nEitan Buchbinder : That's helpful. The Electronics Business Group was up 13% year-over-year, but down sequentially about 4%. So could ongoing chip supply constraints lead the business to decline sequentially in Q3?\nMike Roman : Well, we saw, as we said, some strength in the end markets. And I think it's -- the first half, we were up overall, still low teens for the business. And maybe it's -- I would say the -- it was really more of a seasonality than a sequential dynamic. And as we get to the second half, the one other thing I would add, we're going to start to see some more challenging comps. We saw strong growth dynamics, not only in our home improvement and other areas in consumer also in the cleaning supplies business as we went through the pandemic. So that's the other dynamic to watch.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for closing comments.\nMike Roman : To wrap up, our second quarter performance was strong, marked by broad-based growth, increased margins and robust cash flow. I'm confident in our ability to continue executing well as we navigate COVID-19 impacts. And we will stay focused on taking advantage of market trends and overcoming supply challenges while continuing to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line."}, {"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 1, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-04-27 17:54:12", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, April 27, 2021. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. And welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial Officer; along with John Banovetz, our Chief Technology Officer. John is joining us today to discuss our new sustainability goals which we introduced in February. Mike, Monish, and John will make some formal comments, then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Please turn to slide 2. Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our upcoming 2021 quarterly earnings conference calls which will be held on July 27 and October 26. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note, throughout today's presentation we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release. And finally, as previously disclosed in our Form 8-K dated March 22, 2021, 3M changed its accounting principle for pension and post-retirement plan cost and our measure of segment operating performance. The information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all time periods presented. Please turn to slide 4, and I'll now hand it off to Mike. Mike?\nMike Roman: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The first quarter was strong for 3M with broad-based organic growth across all business groups and geographic areas. Our team executed well and posted record sales, robust cash flow, and expanded margins along with a double digit increase in earnings per share. We saw encouraging improvement in many of our end markets, while others remained well below pre-pandemic levels. We also faced and addressed ongoing supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19, exacerbated by improving macroeconomic trends and Winter Storm Uri, all of which are increasing the cost of doing business. I am proud of the way 3Mers have stepped up to manage and overcome these challenges, keeping our factories running, expanding our manufacturing capacity, and driving innovation for our customers across our businesses. We have found new ways to engage with customers and create solutions no matter where we are around the world, learnings we will take forward as we come out of the pandemic. Looking ahead, we expect continued strengthening of the global economy, though we anticipate the recovery to be uneven as the trajectory of the pandemic, roll-out of vaccines, and government policies evolve in different stages around the world. We are confident in our business as we navigate COVID-19 uncertainty, and with one quarter behind us, we are maintaining our full year guidance for organic growth, earnings per share, and cash flow. Our team remains focused on driving growth, improving operational performance, and delivering for our customers and shareholders. Please turn to slide 5. Company-wide total sales increased to $8.9 billion with organic growth of 8% and earnings of $2.77 per share up 27% year on year on an adjusted basis. Geographically, organic growth was led by Asia-Pacific up 13% with China up 32%. Growth in the Americas was 6% with the United States up 7%, while EMEA grew 6%. We expanded our adjusted EBITDA margins to nearly 28% with all business groups above 23% and increased free cash flow to $1.4 billion with a conversion rate of 86%. 3M increased our dividend in the first quarter, marking our 63rd straight year of increases. We also continue to build 3M for the long term and prioritize investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability. While we manage end market challenges related to COVID-19, we are investing to capitalize on global growth opportunities in healthcare, electronics, home improvement, personal safety, and other favorable market trends. This includes our priority growth platforms which grew 10% in the quarter as we apply science to advanced growing areas like automotive electrification and biopharma filtration. The fundamental strengths of 3M, our unique technology platforms, advanced manufacturing, global capabilities, and leading brands position us well to win in these markets into the future. We are accelerating digital strategies across 3M and expanding our use of data and data analytics to better serve our customers and improve performance. For example, we are using new cloud-based technologies to provide better insights into our global workflows from raw material purchase through product delivery which is helping us navigate the current supply chain challenges. We are stepping up our leadership in sustainability with significant new commitments that will bend the curve on carbon emissions, water use, and improving water quality. In a similar way, we are implementing a long term plan to advance equity and inclusion as we launch new scholarship programs and a new goal to create 5 million opportunities in STEM education, with initial efforts focused here in the Twin Cities. At the same time, 3M continues to help lead the fight against COVID-19 with 630 million respirators distributed in the first quarter. We are also providing our expertise as we engage with the Biden administration and governments around the world on how to better prepare for future pandemics. Overall, I am pleased with our performance in the first quarter as we remain focused on driving growth, improving productivity, and advancing sustainability. To provide additional insight on that last point, sustainability, I will now turn it over to 3M's Chief Technology Officer, John. John?\nJohn Banovetz: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and please turn to slide 6. I'm proud to lead 3M's research and development and sustainability teams. Every day, we bring our innovation to bear on tough challenges, which includes applying 3M science to create a more efficient company and a more sustainable world. As you may have seen, in February we announced expanded sustainability goals. We plan to commit approximately $1 billion over the next 20 years through both capital and operating investments to make our operations more efficient and effective with a focus on air, water, and waste. First, we are committing to become carbon-neutral across our global operations. We expect to rapidly bend our curve of emissions with 2019 as our baseline and aggressive milestones along the way: 50% reduction by 2030, 80% by 2040, and 100% by 2050. Second, 3M plans to reduce water use at our facilities by 25% over the next decade, targeting a 10% reduction by 2022 and 20% reduction by 2025. Third, at our largest locations, we are taking action and installing advanced filtration technology that will return even higher quality water to the environment after its use in our operations. These goals are driven by science and a clearly defined path. We have identified the investments and technologies that will enable our success from thermal oxidizers to reverse osmosis, and work is already underway. At 3M's facility in Antwerp, for example, we have expanded our thermal oxidizer system and reduced our carbon emissions by 1 million tons per year. Overall, our thermal oxidizers reduce our carbon footprint by more than 90% when fully installed. And in Decatur, Alabama, we have implemented a water treatment system with granular activated carbon, also known as a GAC system that has improved the quality of water we return to the environment by 90%. We intend to add complementary technology that will further improve water quality by 2024. We will continue to advance new state of the art technologies including through partnerships with customers, governments, communities, and others to further accelerate our progress. Our actions demonstrate 3M's commitment to continuous improvement and our ongoing work to advance our environmental stewardship. Over the last two decades, 3M has reduced our emissions by 70% while doubling revenues. Our headquarters is fully powered by renewable electricity, and 40% of 3M's global electricity use is now renewable; on our way to 100%. Every new 3M product includes a sustainability value commitment, and over the last five years, our innovations have helped customers avoid 75 million tons of emissions. And just last week we committed to reduce our use of new plastic made from petroleum, also known as virgin fossil-based plastic, by 125 million pounds by 2025 through new packaging and innovative product design in our Consumer business. We recognize the urgency of the world's climate and environmental challenges and are focused on making a difference both today and in future generations. I encourage you to read our annual sustainability report to be released in early May for more details on our progress and priorities. Please turn to slide 7, and I'll turn it over to Monish. Monish?\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you, John, and I wish you all a very good morning. Company-wide first quarter sales were $8.9 billion, up 9.6% year on year or an increase of 8% on an organic basis. Sales growth combined with operating rigor and disciplined cost management drove adjusted operating income of $2 billion, up 19%, with adjusted operating margins of 22.5%, up 170 basis points year on year. First quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings per share were $2.77, up 27% compared to last year's adjusted results. On this slide, you can see the components that impacted both margins and earnings per share. Organic volume growth along with our ongoing cost management and productivity efforts were the biggest contributors to first quarter operating margins and earnings, adding 150 basis points to margins and $0.34 to earnings per share year on year. Turning to selling prices and raw materials, as Mike mentioned, we experienced increasing cost particularly for raw materials and logistics due to the impacts on the strengthening end markets, ongoing COVID pandemic, along with Winter Storm Uri. As a result, first quarter net selling price and raw materials performance reduced both operating margins and earnings per share by 20 basis points and $0.01, respectively. In our view, we expect global supply chain dynamics to remain fluid and for raw material and logistics headwinds to persist. Therefore, we now anticipate a full year raw materials and logistics headwind of $0.30 to $0.50 per share versus a prior expectation of flat to a $0.10 headwind at the start of the year. Looking at the second quarter, we currently anticipate a net selling price and raw materials headwinds to operating margin in the range of 75 to 125 basis points. We are taking multiple actions to address these increased headwinds including selling price increases, global sourcing efforts, improving yields in our factories, and ongoing demand planning given the dynamic environment. We expect these actions will gain traction as we move through the year, particularly in the second half. Moving to divestiture impacts, the lost income from the drug delivery divestiture in May of last year was neutral to margins, however, was a $0.03 headwind year on year to earnings. Foreign currency net of hedging impacts added 40 basis points to margins and $0.13 to earnings per share as the U.S. dollar weakened against most major currencies year on year. We continue to expect foreign exchange to be an earnings benefit of $0.15 per share for the full year. Three other non-operating items impacted our year on year earnings per share performance. First, our continued strong cash flow and liquidity position give us the opportunity in Q1 to redeem an additional $450 million of debt early that was due to mature in 2022. As a result, we incurred higher net interest expense of approximately $0.02 per share versus Q1 last year. This impact was more than offset by year on year non-operating pension benefit of $0.05 per share. Combined, these items resulted in lower net non-operating expense of $0.03 per share versus last year's first quarter. Secondly, a lower tax rate versus last year provided a $0.14 benefit to earnings per share. The lower tax rate was primarily a function of non-repeating favorable adjustments related to U.S. tax treatment of international income along with regional income mix and equity based compensation. Our full year 2021 tax rate expectations remain unchanged in the range of 20% to 21%. Finally, average diluted shares were up 1% year on year which reduced per share earnings by $0.02. Please turn to slide 8 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. We delivered another quarter of robust free cash flow with first quarter adjusted free cash flow of $1.4 billion, up 49% year on year, with conversion of 86%. Cash flows in the quarter were primarily driven by robust growth in cash flow from operations along with our ongoing daily management of working capital. First quarter capital expenditures were $310 million. For the full year, we continue to expect CapEx to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. During the quarter, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $858 million and share repurchases of $231 million. Our strong cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to strengthen our capital structure. We ended the quarter with $13 billion in net debt, a reduction of nearly $5 billion since the end of Q1 last year. As a result, our net debt to EBITDA ratio has declined significantly from 2.2 a year ago to 1.4 at the end of Q1. Our net debt position along with our strong cash flow generation capability continues to provide us financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities, and return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure. Please turn to slide 9 where I will summarize the business group performance for Q1. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business which posted organic growth of 10.3% year on year in the first quarter. This result includes a 6.4 percentage point benefit from pandemic-related respirator demand. Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate strong pandemic-related respirator mask demand. However, the year on year contribution to sales growth will decline as we lap last year's quarterly comparison. Overall, general Industrial manufacturing activity continued to improve during Q1, resulting in a pick-up in growth across the portfolio. Personal Safety posted double digit organic growth year on year driven by ongoing demand for respirators. Industrial adhesives and tapes grew low-double digits primarily due to strong demand across Industrial and Electronics end markets. The continued strength in the residential housing market drove good performance in our roofing granules business which was up double digits organically versus Q1 of last year. Turning to the rest of the Safety and Industrial businesses, Automotive Aftermarket grew high-single digits organically, the Electrical Markets business was up mid-single digits, and Abrasives grew low-single digits while our Closure and Masking business declined year on year. Safety and Industrials first quarter segment operating margin were 24.4% up 70 basis points year on year. Operating margins were driven by leverage on sales growth which was partially offset by increase in raw materials, logistics, and legal costs. Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which delivered a strong start to the year with first quarter organic sales growth of 9.8% despite the well-known semiconductor supply chain constraints. Our Electronics-related business was up high-teens organically with continued strength in semiconductor, factory automation, and data centers, along with strong demand for consumer electronic devices, namely tablets and TVs. Our Auto OEM business was up 21% year on year compared to the 14% increase in global car and light truck builds. Looking ahead, we continue to monitor the global semiconductor supply chain and its potential impact on the electronics and automotive industries. Turning to Advanced Materials, which increased mid-single digits largely as a result of the year on year increase in automotive builds and finally, our Transportation Safety business was flat year on year while Commercial Solutions declined slightly. Transportation and Electronics first quarter operating margin were 23.3%, up 260 basis points year on year, benefiting from strong leverage on sales growth and prior-year COVID-related asset write-downs which were partially offset by increases in raw materials and logistics costs. Turning to our Healthcare business, healthcare providers continue to be challenged from the ebbs and flows of COVID-19 cases as elective procedure volume still remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, we continue to experience strong pandemic-related demand for respirators to protect frontline healthcare workers which more than offset the headwinds from the decline in elective procedure volumes. As a result, our Healthcare business delivered first quarter organic sales growth of 9.3% versus last year. The Medical Solutions business grew high-single digits driven by continued strong respirator demand. Excluding respirators, organic growth in this business was down low-single digits due to the ongoing year on year impact of low procedure volumes. Organic sales for our Oral Care business increased double digits year on year. This result is primarily due to last year's COVID related comp as dental offices started closing their doors during Q1 last year. The Separation and Purification business increased low-teens year on year. This business continues to experience solid demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccines and therapeutic development and manufacturing along with improving demand trends for water filtration solutions. Health Information Systems returned to positive organic growth, up mid-single digits, while Food Safety declined mid-single digits organically versus last year's strong comparison. Healthcare's first quarter operating margins were 22.7%, up 120 basis points year on year. First quarter margins were driven by leverage on sales growth which was partially offset by supply chain disruption and increasing raw materials and logistics costs. Lastly, first quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was 7.8% year on year with strength across most retail channels led by e-commerce. Organic sales growth continued to be led by the Home Improvement business, up double digits organically driven by strong demand for Command adhesives, Filtrete air quality solutions, and ScotchBlue painter's tape. Stationery and Office returned to positive organic growth in Q1, up mid-single digits, with ongoing strength in consumer demand for packaging and shipping products. This business also delivered improved growth in Scotch brand office tapes, as we start to lap the COVID-related impacts from remote work and school trends. And finally, our Home Care business was up low-single digits organically versus last year's strong comparison. Consumer's operating margins were 21.1%, or similar to last year, as leverage on sales growth was offset by increasing costs for raw materials, logistics, outsourced hard goods manufacturing, and increased investments in advertising and merchandising. Please turn to slide 10 for a discussion of our full year 2021 guidance. As you can see from our Q1 results, we are off to a good start to the year. Looking ahead, as Mike mentioned, we expect continued strengthening of the global economy along with increasing opportunities in end markets with favorable trends. However, we foresee that the improvement will remain fluid and uneven as we go through 2021 given the ongoing impact of the pandemic. As a result, we anticipate a number of items that will need to be navigated as we go through the year. For example, starting with evolving impacts from COVID including respirator demand, healthcare elective procedures, supply chains, shutdowns, and government response. Next, the continued constrained supply of semiconductor chips and related impacts to consumer electronics and automotive OEM production. In addition, the expected increase in costs for raw materials and logistics and in some cases constrained availability. And finally, we expect to increase investments through the year in growth, productivity, and sustainability along with managing ongoing legal costs as PFAS and other legal proceedings progress. Thus, taking these items into account, along with it being early in the year, we think it prudent to maintain our full year guidance of 3% to 6% for organic growth, earnings per share of $9.20 to $9.70, and free cash flow conversion of 95% to 105%. Turning to the second quarter, let me highlight a few items of note. First, we expect continued strong execution by the 3M team in the face of a very fluid and uncertain environment. As I mentioned during my remarks, we have increased the expected headwind from raw materials and logistics cost for the full year. We are taking several actions including increasing selling prices to address these headwinds as we go through the year. These actions will take a little time to gain traction. Therefore, we anticipate a second quarter year on year operating margin headwind of 75 basis points to 125 basis points from selling prices net of higher raw materials and logistics costs. And finally, we expect a pretax restructuring charge in the range of $25 million to $50 million as we continue our actions related to our December 2020 announcement. To wrap up, we are off to a good start for the year delivering broad based growth, strong operational execution, and robust cash flows. We are prioritizing capital to our greatest opportunities for growth, productivity, and sustainability while focused on delivering for our customers, improving operating rigor, and enhancing daily management. With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for letting me in here. Are you guys seeing any strange order patterns as far as like double ordering or any kind of panic inventory rebuild? Anything? I would imagine you would probably see it in Transportation and Electronics, perhaps equally in Transportation and Electronics of all the segments, but I'll just leave it at that. Anything on the ordering patterns that's unusual?\nMike Roman: Scott, I would say we see certainly a pick-up in orders when we see markets recovering and improving, and Transportation and Electronics were strong end markets for us in Q1. I wouldn't say we see anything unusual there. It's what comes with a normal pick-up in the marketplace. When you look at it a good measure for us is what's happening with channel inventories, and I would say we see them very much in line with what you have written about in your reports, that we see the changes due to growth trends. Overall inventory in our Industrial channels remains still relatively low. Transportation Electronics with the supply chain impacts from the semiconductor shortage we're seeing some challenges there, and it's just responding with the disruption from the semiconductor shortage. Healthcare's pretty steady, reacting to the trends still. Elective procedures well below pre-pandemic levels, so that's impacting there. Consumer, it's a mixed case. We have high demand in Home Improvement. We're seeing lower levels there. You see a little lower levels when you see the pick-up, but it's responding to the marketplace. Otherwise, I would say the ordering trends were pretty much in line with what we expected. A little better than we expected in March which was really reflected in our broad based growth but otherwise nothing unusual.\nScott Davis: That's helpful. And then just to clarify on the $0.30 to $0.50 supply chain raw material logistics, whatever issues, is that net of what you expect on price for the year? Or is there some opportunity to offset that full amount with price, you're just not certain yet of the magnitude?\nMonish Patolawala: Hey, Scott. That's a great question. $0.30 to $0.50 is just pure raw material logistics headwind. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are going after price increase, improving yields in our factories, as well as working with our supply chain partners to reduce the impact as much as we can. You can see in the first quarter we had 70 basis points of price increase, and as I've also said, it's going to take a little bit of time for these actions to gain traction. So we expect that the second half will be better than the first half on the price perspective.\nScott Davis: Okay. Good luck. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Probably can be tons of price cost and other questions, but maybe since we have John on the line, if you don't mind, could I throw one at him? Just wondering if you could actually update us on kind of the size of the priority programs currently that were outlined for us when we were in Saint Paul, whenever that was. Seems like a lifetime ago. I think it was 2019. And anything you can tell us on the vitality rate of the portfolio overall? One of the things that I always try to put my finger on, it's always just a little bit difficult, is the flip side of the new product development, what's going on kind of end of life and commoditization at the low end. And so the effort to counter that, if you have any color there, that would be interesting also.\nJohn Banovetz: Thanks, Jeff. Thanks for the question. So maybe on the first part around our priority growth platforms and our PGPs or so, they're about 5% of the overall portfolio I would say and growing quite a bit I think, as Mike referenced. We've seen approximately about a 10% growth over the last quarter of those platforms, and they continue to grow. And as you know, they sit in high growth market spaces for us, so we would expect that growth to continue on those platforms as we continue to find customer solutions in those areas. Second comment is kind of around the vitality of the MP value part of it. We've talked about MP value in the past. That's definitely an important metric for 3M without a question, but it's also a secondary metric for us, the primary obviously being growth and our profitability for that. I'd say over the last few years, our MPVI and things have trended to be about in the mid-20s if you take an average over the last five years or so, which is I think roughly a pretty good guide for 3M overall. And obviously COVID's had some of that impact on trends here in the near term as well as we've gone forward. And then kind of as you said the commoditization, I personally don't think a whole lot about that. I think about, are we aligned with our customers? Are we solving customer needs? Are our R&D resources geared toward growth and solving those issues for our customers and making sure that we can deliver our technologies and our solutions to our customers in order to be able to grow and sustain profitable margin and ROIC?\nJeff Sprague: Thanks. Just a quick follow-up. Was that MPVI a mid-20s kind of five-year number or three-year number? What time span?\nJohn Banovetz: It's about a five-year number.\nJeff Sprague: Five-year number. Okay. Thanks. Appreciate it. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey. I guess if there's a surprise this quarter it's that despite having a solid operating beat you're leaving guidance unchanged. And Monish walked through all the list of headwinds and sized all of them or at least framed them with the exception of the last item about potential legal costs. Could you just either size for us or frame for us what the expectation might be this quarter either in terms of remediation costs or product liability? Because you're certainly signaling that something could be brewing here. Thanks.\nMonish Patolawala: Sure, Deane. As I said in my prepared remarks, I think some of this -- I'll just start first with all the headwinds that I've mentioned. At the same time, all the other actions that we are also taking to continue to drive operating rigor, whether it's raising price, driving operating rigor, and continued strong cash flow. So I'll keep all that first with the headwinds, with some partial offsets that will take a little bit of time to implement. As it regards legal cost you can see this more as we file our Q this morning, but there are a couple of things. You'll see the PFAS reserves are up around $50 million between the end of fourth quarter to this quarter, and then the mask respirator accrual is up approximately $20 million. To predict what exactly is going to be in the second half of the year is quite tough. But what we do see is, as we prepare for some of these trials, for example the Combat Arms trial that's also on in Florida right now, with the MDL as well as some of the other cases that will start picking up in PFAS, we expect that our legal fees or legal cost to prepare for these trials will go up during the second half of this year.\nDeane Dray: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just as a second question, it is interesting we're talking about a -- it's going to be tepid, but the back-to-school, return-to-office is outside of the seasonality. But it is encouraging. Can you frame for us expectations in terms of how much that might contribute in the second quarter?\nMonish Patolawala: Yeah, Deane. What we talked about is we did see a return to growth in our Stationery and Office business in first quarter, up mid-single digits, as Monish mentioned. That is the first indication that we're seeing pick-up from return to school and return to the workplace to a degree. It's one of those areas where we're looking at the uncertainties related to COVID, how will it play out. How big a return to school? How big a return to the workplace? And when? That will end up being what drives the answer to your question. So I would say good signs that we saw the pick-up in Q1 back to we expect economy to strengthen, and we're encouraged by the vaccines. We're going to have to wait to see how the return to the workplace and school plays out though.\nDeane Dray: Appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. Can you hear me, guys? Some of the constraints you've seen in the supply chain, [Indiscernible] et cetera, normally you see 2Q seasonally higher than 1Q. I'm wondering if the combination of [Indiscernible] production, et cetera, might limit the ability to see that normal seasonal ramp [Indiscernible] right now to 2Q seasonality.\nMonish Patolawala: Nigel, you were breaking up a little but I think your question was around Q2 seasonality, correct? Is that the question?\nNigel Coe: Right. Exactly. Yes.\nMonish Patolawala: So I'll just start with my three quarters that I've been here in the pandemic that we've seen. I don't think any trend seems to be normal, Nigel. You've seen trends that seem to be completely abnormal compared to what the past has been, compared to monthly cyclicality as well as compared to quarterly cyclicality, so I'll just start with that as the first piece. The second I would say is one thing you can definitely count on us in Q2 is strong execution. We are also confident that end markets are going to pick up, but I think they're going to be uneven. And for the second quarter we're still monitoring quite a few things, one of course Mike just mentioned about what happens with the stationery. How does that return to work come in? The return to work impacts not just the Stationery business, but it impacts our Graphics business. It impacts our Signage business and what happens there. And what people spend I think is going to be important to watch. The second piece is as the pandemic is playing out in parts of the world, elective procedures continue to be below pre-pandemic levels. We'll see how that plays out. The well-known semiconductor chip shortage, how it impacts auto, how it impacts consumer electronics is another piece. When you think about supply chain disruption, one is of course raw material costs and logistics costs that I've talked about quite a bit. The other one of course is product availability and making sure there is product available from our suppliers to continue to keeps us manufacturing. Now, I'll tell you this, that our supply chain team has done an amazing job keeping the factories running, making sure we are delivering to our customers thanks to the relationship they have with the suppliers, and we appreciate all the work the suppliers have also done to partner with us to minimize disruption as much as possible. We are also raising prices, but it's going to take little bit of time. The inflation has come in faster. So you're going to see 75 basis points to 125 basis points of headwind which is the net of price versus inflation and logistics. As I also mentioned, we're going to do restructuring, which was announced in Q4 of 2020. We told you it's somewhere between $250 million to $300 million charge for the year. As of first quarter, we are at $150 million. So we've got approximately $100 million to $150 million to go for the remaining of the year. The second quarter is going to see $25 million to $50 million of restructuring charge. The balance will come in 3Q and 4Q. If this economy continues to go the way it is, outlook is that indirect cost, travel cost, some of the legal costs we talked about will keep going up. Any other one-time headwinds will also go up as it regards compensation. And then our goal is, as Mike has mentioned, we have tremendous areas that we can invest in. And our goal is for the long run we want to keep investing in growth productivity and sustainability and put all that into play. That's why we felt it prudent to maintain guidance. Also, to answer your question, it's hard to follow normal seasonality trends with all these things in play.\nNigel Coe: Right. Thanks Monish, that's great color. My follow-up question is really just going back to the guidance and I understand all of the uncertainties you just laid out very, very clearly. But seems like the pension change in the way you account for the assets, seems like that's about a $0.20 year-over-year benefit to FY 2020. Was that change in the original guidance range, or was that additive to the [Indiscernible] guidance?\nMonish Patolawala: Nigel, I would say, as we have stated, we have restated all the years that are presented. So the year-over-year impact of that is approximately $0.11. So that's to answer your specific question on pension. The offsets to that, a couple of things. We took the opportunity to go redeem $450 million of debt that was due in 2022. That had an impact of $0.02 on interest for the quarter. And then as share prices have gone up, even though we have done share buyback of $231 million or share repurchase, our dilution has gone up, and that impacted $0.02 for the quarter. The total impact for other financials we had originally in our guide was zero. Right now, we are saying it's plus $0.05, to be clear.\nNigel Coe: Great color. Thanks very much, Monish.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, guys. Good morning. Just following up on I think the last couple questions here, just sequentially you guys are usually up 1Q to 2Q, and I think you mentioned a whole host of items that kind of break the normal seasonality. Can you maybe just give us like a total number that you see from 1Q to 2Q that would be the mechanical impacts including the raws and the inflation? That's fine. Just all-in what the headwinds are from 1Q to 2Q? So we can just kind of like -- 1Q is obviously like a big upside, but then 2Q is going to be seasonally weak. So just trying to kind of figure out in total where we should kind of start from mechanically.\nMonish Patolawala: That's a great question, Steve. Just same comments that I made before. As you know, volume is the biggest piece that drives margin leverage for 3M. You should assume the normal 30% to 40% margin leverage that you would get. The amount of volume is going to depend on a lot of the uncertainties that I've talked about, whether it's elective procedures, whether it is semiconductor chip availability for Auto and Consumer, whether it is the strength in Stationery remains, whether the oil and gas industry picks up. So a lot of long term, I would say, end markets growing. We'll have to figure out what happens in the second quarter with all of these from an end market perspective. Similarly, on supply chain disruption, there are two pieces. One is of course the inflation that we've told you about which will cost 75 basis points to 125 basis points of headwind between price and inflation and the raw material and logistics cost as well as making sure that we have all the product availability that we have. So that's the other, I would say, headwind to 1Q.\nSteve Tusa: Can you just talk about that headwind sequentially? What that headwind would be? What you've already kind of absorbed in first quarter, and what it is sequentially?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So a piece of it got absorbed in the first quarter, Steve. I think we'll have to see how April plays itself out, and May. As we look at product availability, making sure that our suppliers continue to be able to provide all the goods over the quarter is something that we're working on. Again, it's too early to say because it's a very dynamic situation that changes every day. And again, the relationship we have with our suppliers helps us get the product as much as we can, but they're also constrained right now with the overall supply chain situation in the world. The other headwind is $25 million to $50 million of restructuring. So this is still a part of the overall restructuring program we announced in Q4. We have done up to $150 million in Q1. We're going to take another $25 million to $50 million in Q2, and the balance will come in Q3 and Q4. Indirect costs. So as the economies are starting to open up, you are going to see hopefully ad merch and travel start to go up. That's a headwind to Q1. As we are starting to see the economies starting to pick up, our investments in growth productivity and sustainability will continue to increase, so that's how I would frame Q1 versus Q2.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Just it just seems to me like the biggest piece again is this kind of raw material issue, but some of that you absorbed in the first quarter. And on a year-over-year basis, it looks like that's like, I don't know, $0.15 to $0.20 year-over-year? \nMonish Patolawala: It's a 75 basis points to 125 basis points headwind.\nSteve Tusa: All right. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to focus perhaps on Safety and Industrial. The headline organic growth there was slightly lower in Q1 than Q4 even with the improving economy. And that's really that respirator tailwind for your 400 basis points less in Q1 than Q4. So just wanted to understand, what does the guidance for that segment and/or 3M in aggregate reflect for the respirator tailwind over the balance of this year? We've seen some write-downs at certain distributors and so forth for that kind of activity after over-ordering last year. Do you assume that that could become a headwind later this year, or the headwind really comes in 2022?\nMike Roman: Julian, thanks for the question. We talked about Q1. We continue to see strong demand that 630 million respirators delivered in Q1. And still in the quarter, 90% going to healthcare workers and I would say first responders and increasingly essential industries. The demand as we move forward, it's going to depend on a few factors. The first is what's going to be the demand in healthcare, and that's going to depend on how the pandemic plays out and I would say how governments respond to dynamics in the pandemic. And there's been changings in protocols in use of respirators, for example, as one of those dynamics. As Monish said, this is one of the areas where we're working through the uncertainties. There's that demand. And we're working on governments all over the world around stockpile strategies and continuing to supply into those. And then there is consumer demand and increasing demand in Industrial as economies recover. So we see some shifting as we go forward over time from the high priority more than 90% into Healthcare shifting more into Industrial and Consumer. And then the demand overall, how much is it going to be relative to the impact on the overall enterprise relative to SIBG? That's going to depend on how each of those play out. But we're expecting to continue to see demand in Industrial and Consumer and Healthcare as we go through the year.\nMonish Patolawala: To answer specifically your other question, Julian -- I'm sorry -- on why is the growth rate slowing down, we are starting to lap. So if my memory is right, Q1 of 2020 there was $100 million of disposable respirators that the company had disclosed even before my time. You're going to see actually the amount, if you're looking at the percent, it's going to slow down, as I said in my prepared remarks, because you're starting to lap the pandemic-related respirator demand year on year.\nJohn Banovetz: Julian, we disclosed all that last year as we went through the year. So Q2, it's a $225 million year on year comp. So we step from $100 million to [$200 million in a quarter] (ph), then $235 million in Q3. And I think in Q4 we were around $280 million. Last year. So the year on year contribution of growth is going to decline.\nJulian Mitchell: Yes. Understood. Thank you very much. And maybe just my second question around the capital deployment aspect. Cash flows been very, very good yet again leverage I think is now around 1.4 times. Any updated thoughts around the balance sheet usage? Or do we think that just given sort of the background leverage is likely to remain fairly low through the rest of the year?\nMonish Patolawala: Yeah. It's a great question, Julian. I would go back again to just our capital priorities. Prioritization hasn't changed. Our first priority is always invest in R&D. Mike mentioned the areas that we have as we think about just a few, and even John talked about whether it's Biopharma, Home Improvement, Personal Safety, Digital, Semiconductor, Healthcare they're tremendous opportunities that we believe we can keep investing in. So that's our first priority is I think in the long run that will give us the best return. The second priority is dividends. We did increase dividends 1% this year. It's the 63rd year of consecutive dividend increase. Our third priority is M&A. As you know, we are busy integrating Acelity. It's doing very well and integrating well into 3M. We don't see another acquisition in the size of Acelity in the near future, but we are always looking for opportunities where we believe it's complementary to 3M's strength as well as 3M can add value and synergies. And then our last priority is share repurchase. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we did have $231 million of share repurchases. I think the strength that we have right now, Julian, of 1.4 net leverage gives us a lot of flexibility to go either way as well as gives us strategic opportunities to deploy when needed.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Hey. Good morning, guys. So Transportation and Electronics as you know had a very high range of outcomes for the year, low to high-single digits. And obviously starting out at the high end of the range, is there any reason at this point why you wouldn't see the high end of the range in that particular segment given the comps do get a fair amount easier for the next couple quarters? Maybe just could give us more color on how Electronics and Auto really performed versus your expectations? I know you said absolutely that seems like they continue to be strong or even improve despite supply chain concerns.\nMike Roman: It's an important question for us too, Andy. We had that wider range at the beginning of the year which really reflected the dynamics in those end markets, the uncertainty we were looking at as we came into the year. And we certainly had a good start to the year. Transportation and Electronics off to a strong start, much like the rest of the company. They're still facing some considerable uncertainties in that marketplace, and we talked about the chip shortage and its impact on both Electronics and Automotive. I think you see kind of changing dynamics in the build rates, much of it reflecting that dynamic. Electronics, I would say Consumer Electronics is off to a strong start. Tablets and TVs really driving a lot of that. So it's how are these trends going to play out through the year? And it still reflects I would say a wider range of outcomes. And it also is going to depend on how the pandemic plays out. Some of these are dynamics being driven by the pandemic and its impact on the economy in general. I would say that wide range that we came into the year, we still have a wide range view of how the uncertainties will impact these key market segments. But again, off to a strong start. Automotive above the build rates of our growth and Consumer Electronics above the build rates there. So we're winning in the marketplace with our solutions, and we're well positioned. We'll see how the market dynamics take us as we go through the year.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Mike, wanted to ask you about your priority growth platforms in the context of -- obviously there was strong growth in the quarter, I think 10%. There's a lot of money out there, whether it's the new Biden American Jobs Plan, focus on automotive electrification continues to increase. How do you sort of change your focus if at all on some of these platforms? Do you shift more money into something like automotive electrification? Do you see more growth in certain areas like that moving forward?\nMike Roman: Andy, we talked about it all year last year about what we were doing to invest in the future while we were managing through the big challenges that the pandemic threw at us in 2020. And we are accelerating, I would say, investments not only in our priority growth platforms but other market trends that we were seeing that were opportunities for us, and we talked about things that were going on obviously in Personal Safety but also Home Improvement and other areas that trends were strong. So that's how we're prioritizing growth based on the market trends, where we can create unique and differentiated value. Priority growth platforms tend to represent both of those, strong markets, as John mentioned earlier. These are higher growth market segments. And then we have the investments that we make in the trends coming out of the pandemic, and we're stepping those up as we see the opportunity. So we're really driving those based on the growth opportunity that we see in front of us as we go through 2021, not locked in on a plan that we put together for our priority growth platforms before the year started. So it is what we see as an opportunity to drive the growth and the growth outlook that we had for the year as we came into 2021.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Appreciate it, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin: Yeah. Good morning. Yeah. I can reassure you that this will be one Consumer stocking up on 3M masks because we have to deal with inferior, inferior Kimberly-Clark product. So I just want to tell you that. Having said that, just the dynamic in the Americas on Safety and Industrial and Transportation and Electronics in the quarter, I think you guys gave very useful breakdown. Just broader dynamic by sub end market, but in America, Safety and Industrial is up 12%. I assume it's because of Safety. But Transportation and Electronics down 4%. One is more OE, one is more channel. Can you just talk about this dynamic? What's happening? I think it does sound there's some pre-stock in OE, but what's happening in the distribution channel?\nMike Roman: Yeah. Andrew, you're right. Safety and Industrial business [Indiscernible] in the performance in Americas, a big portion is driven by Personal Safety. It's been a strong growth driver. We talked about it. Monish highlighted some of the other Industrial businesses. We're seeing recovery in the Industrial markets in general. We're seeing increasing demand in industrial adhesives and tapes and industrial mineral products in the U.S. with the strong residential housing growth. All of those are driving what's going on in the Americas across Safety and Industrial business group. Transportation and Electronics, it's driven globally, the strong growth that you saw, by semiconductor fabrication, data centers, what I talked about earlier in Consumer Electronics. Those are not the big drivers obviously in the U.S. at this point. The automotive is the driver in the U.S., and I would say we're seeing good performance on our spec-ins. We're winning additional spec-ins in the OEMs. And as the build rates pick up in the U.S., we'll see TEBG, Transportation business from the automotive side get a strong contribution. Monish talked about some of the areas of uncertainties and things that we're looking at. Commercial solutions and the demand for graphics that are part of that, transportation safety products. Those are still flat year-over-year growth, even in decline in key end market segments, and that's one of the things that is an uncertainty as we look at the year. How are those markets going to recover as economies recover? So that will be part of the answer to Transportation and Electronics picking up as we go in the Americas in particular.\nAndrew Obin: Got you. And just a follow-up question I think Andy touched a little bit on it. But it seems that we have plenty of visibility on semiconductor CapEx going up in the U.S. over the next several years. Given the semi capacity on the margin over the past decade has been added outside of North America, do you need to make any adjustments to your manufacturing footprint in North America to sort of play this growth? Or is it just nature of your process and fungible capacity and just supplies better overall capacity utilization in North America given the assets you already have in place?\nMike Roman: Yeah, Andrew. As you know, our strategy is to be close to customers, invest in capacity to meet the demands regionally around the world, and that's true broadly across the enterprise. There are some key product and market segments where we have more of a critical center in key areas of the world. U.S. is one of those areas where in the end we're a net exporter of goods out of the United States because we have a stronger footprint here, and that's also true in much of the portfolio that we serve semiconductor fabrication with. We build that out close to the end users, close to the customers. So we have significant resources in Asia, for example. We also supply a significant portion of it from capacity in the U.S. and even some capacity in Europe. So I think we're well positioned if we see that shift, and it's going to take time to play out. And as has been the case for us throughout history, as we see market dynamics change and shift around the world, we'll invest to build up that capacity where it's needed. So we'll have time to adjust and add capacity, but we start in a good place relative to that market segment.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you for your answer. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Walsh : Hi. Good morning. Hey. So a lot of details already around the logistics and the supply chain as it relates to EPS and margin. But curious if there's any sales impact to your ability to kind of get raw feedstock, et cetera, that you want to call out. Just because if you look at even midpoint of your guidance for the full year, just having a little trouble reconciling the two-year and the three-year kind of growth stack deceleration from what you just printed.\nMonish Patolawala: So, John, I would just say, back to the point on Q2, there is a lot of uncertainty in the supply chain markets other than of course the raw material and logistics costs we've talked about. It's just making sure that the product is flowing, making sure our suppliers can make the product. As of right now, as I said, it's a very dynamic situation that's changing every day. So that is why that's one of the uncertainties that we have called out in the second quarter and the total year, that we've got to navigate through this and hopefully as we get through the second quarter, we'll be in a better state to see where we are for the year. So hopefully that answers your question. Since you're talking about the second quarter -- and my memory failed me earlier. Sorry. So Steve's question earlier also on if you're looking at Q1 versus Q2, just another point is FX which is $0.13 benefit in Q1 for the year. We still see that to be $0.15. Again, we'll see where currencies move as the world plays itself out. And then from a tax rate perspective, we were at 16.4% for the first quarter, and our plan is 20% to 21% for the year. So those are the other items I would talk about, John, as I talk about the second quarter and its overall impact.\nJohn Walsh : Great. And then maybe a broader question here. You talked a little bit earlier about kind of new product vitality. You're talking about a lot of interesting technologies around enabling your sustainability commitments. Is there a way for 3M to actually commercialize some of the stuff that you're doing to your own operations, either the technology or the material science? Or can you take what you're doing and actually bring that out to other customers and monetize that?\nMike Roman: Yeah. And, John, I would say for us being a leader in sustainability is also about helping our customers and making a difference for them, and you see that in our expectations and our requirement that every one of our new products has an improvement, an advantage in sustainability. That's one of the ways we can leverage our technology and our technology platforms to make a difference for customers. Now, we're also investing a lot of innovation in our operations, and you look at our fundamental strengths of the company. Our manufacturing capabilities are foundational there. And about one-third of our intellectual property sits in our manufacturing operations, process technologies, and we leverage that for our own performance and our own product quality as a competitive advantage. There are opportunities as we think about ways that we can really lead forward in sustainability solutions that we can expand our impact, and we certainly expect to be able to be a good example for manufacturing companies leading in sustainability. We'll look at, as we have all along, look at innovation opportunities where we can commercialize those as part of our offerings to customers as well.\nJohn Walsh : Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. So my first question, maybe just going back to 2Q for a moment. And I fully recognize that things are fluid right now, but can you talk a little about maybe the trends that you're seeing so far in 2Q? You've got very easy comps this quarter. So is the expectation that you'll see at least an acceleration in growth versus what you saw in 1Q based on what you're seeing today?\nMonish Patolawala: Yeah, Joe, so no major surprises in Q2 so far. So we've started April pretty strong, similar to what we thought it would be. The team continues to execute well. We're working through some of the challenges we have talked about whether it's on the cost or the product availability side. But as you currently pointed out, from a comp basis on the year-over-year basis we will get into the first major quarter of the pandemic. And therefore on a year-over-year basis you should see a higher growth than what you saw in Q1.\nMike Roman: Joe, as a reminder, last year in Q1 we were up 20 basis points organically I believe, and we were down lower, 13%, in Q2. So the comp is a fair amount easier.\nJoe Ritchie: That makes sense. Just wanted to clarify that and then maybe my second question, Monish, you talked about 30% to 40% type volume incrementals when you have decent volumes. I guess can you clarify that comment? Is that an all-in number, taking into account some of the headwinds that you've already discussed on the raw material side or is that just purely on volumes? Just clarifying those comments.\nMonish Patolawala: Joe, it's a great question. So I would say 30% to 40% is in the long term what you should get leverage. 2021 in general is I think unusual. Unusual on multiple fronts, one when we gave you the guide in the beginning of the year we talked about the snapback of indirect costs that should hopefully in 2021 as people start traveling, as we start investing, from an ad merch perspective would go up on a year over. Similarly, at the beginning of the year we reset our comps, so that's a headwind. We also had a property sale in fourth quarter of last year of approximately $50 million of gain that's a non-repeat. So all of those one-time headwinds coming into the year that we talked about. We also talked that we will be increasing our investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability in 2021 as we see some of the trends playing out that can help us continue to grow in the longer term. And so that's the second headwind. And then the third as has come through that I've talked about is the raw material and logistics cost increase, partially offset by the price increases that we are trying to do, increase our yield, and then managing all the other costs that we have whether it's legal costs as PFAS and Combat Arms and some of those proceedings proceed as well as any other investments we want to make as we keep seeing growth opportunities in the long term. That's why I would say 30% to 40% is the normal you should see in the long term, but 2021 is just a little odd for these reasons.\nJoe Ritchie: That makes sense. Thank you for clarifying.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.\nMike Roman: To wrap up, I am pleased with our first quarter performance as we drove strong growth, earnings, and cash flow. We executed well and continue to build for the future through investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability. We are well positioned for a successful 2021 and remain focused on delivering value for our customers and returns for our shareholders. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line."}], "2023": [{"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 4, "year": 2022, "date": "2023-01-24 10:41:03", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, January 24, 2023. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland: Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial and Transformation Officer. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments, then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the home page of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Please turn to slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to slide 3. Please note throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release. Before I hand the call over to Mike, I would like to take a moment and highlight of financial reporting change we are making starting here in Q1 2023. As we announced in our press release on December 20th, we'll be exiting PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. As a result, we have decided to provide additional disclosure by expanding the scope of our non-GAAP measurement adjustments to include the exit of PFAS manufacturing. For 2022, we have treated the Q4 PFAS manufacturing exit cost as a special item in arriving at results adjusted for special items. However, beginning in 2023, we will expand the existing adjustment for special items to also adjust for the sales and estimate of income and associated activity of PFAS manufacturing. Therefore, our outlook for 2023 reflects this adjustment. Today's press release, press release attachments and slide presentation provide information regarding our 2022 performance on our existing Q4 2022 non-GAAP basis, along with some comparative information on the new 2023 outlook basis. We will be providing a Form 8-K during the first quarter to reflect additional effects of this change in our non-GAAP measures and changes in segment reporting. We remain committed to providing strong transparency in reporting our financial performance. And of course, we are always here to address your questions. With that, please turn to slide four and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike?\nMike Roman: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We continue to focus on delivering for our customers and shareholders in a challenging economic environment with slowing growth, inflation and supply chain disruptions. We posted organic growth of 0.4% versus our expectation of 1% to 3%, along with adjusted margins of 19% and adjusted earnings of $2.28 per share. The slower-than-expected growth was due to rapid declines in consumer-facing markets, such as consumer electronics and retail, a dynamic that accelerated in December, as consumers sharply cut discretionary spending and retailers adjusted inventory levels. We also saw a significant slowing in China due to COVID-related disruptions, along with moderating demand across industrial markets. As demand weakened, we took actions to adjust manufacturing output and control costs, which enabled us to deliver a $250 million inventory improvement. In addition to actions taken in the second half of last year, today, we announced restructuring in our manufacturing operations, as we expect the demand trends that we saw in December to extend through the first half of 2023. I will discuss this more later in the call. With supply chain stabilizing, we are focused on improving manufacturing operations and driving working capital. These are our most significant opportunities to improve margins and cash flow. As we navigate the external environment, we continue to position 3M for the future by investing in growth, productivity and sustainability. I will recap 2022 and our outlook for 2023 after Monish takes you through the quarter. Monish?\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to slide five. As you will recall, we highlighted negative trends in our consumer retail and electronics-related businesses in late November. As the fourth quarter progressed, those trends accelerated. We also experienced significant slowing in China as COVID-related impacts resulted in a 17% decline in organic sales in December and down 8% for the quarter. Health Care continued to be challenged in its recovery to pre-pandemic levels, given labor shortages and hospital budgets being under pressure, while industrial end markets mostly remain steady. Fourth quarter total sales were $8.1 billion or down 6.2% year-on-year, which included headwinds from foreign currency translation of minus 5% or $400 million, which is better than the minus 7% we had expected. We also experienced a 1.6% decline from divestitures, or nearly $140 million, largely from the third quarter divestiture of food safety, along with the deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies. On an organic basis, fourth quarter sales increased 0.4% versus last year. This result included an anticipated falloff in disposable respirator demand and the exit of our operations in Russia. These two items, combined, negatively impacted organic sales growth by approximately $230 million or 2.6 percentage points. Excluding this decline, Q4 organic sales growth was 3%. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter operating income was $1.5 billion, with operating margins of 19.1%. Adjusted earnings for the quarter were $2.28 versus $2.45 last year. Turning to the components that impacted fourth quarter operating margins and earnings year-on-year performance. We took a number of actions to navigate the fluid and slowing macroeconomic environment, including managing selling prices to address inflationary pressures, reducing manufacturing output, maintaining strong spending discipline and taking additional restructuring actions to streamline the organization and adjust to slowing end market demand. These actions delivered an underlying benefit to operating margins of 110 basis points and $0.19 to earnings. This helped more than offset headwinds from the sales decline in disposable respirators and Russia exit, which negatively impacted operating margins by 70 basis points and earnings by $0.15 per share. Inflation continues to impact raw material, logistics and energy costs. These pressures remain persistent and are broad-based. In Q4, raw material cost increased approximately $110 million or a negative impact of 1.4 percentage points to operating margins and $0.16 to earnings. As mentioned, foreign currency translation was a negative 5% impact to total sales. This resulted in a headwind of $0.10 to earnings per share, however, was a benefit of 10 basis points to margins. Divestitures, primarily Food Safety, along with the deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies, resulted in a year-over-year headwind of $0.04 to earnings per share in the quarter. Finally, other financial items increased earnings by a net $0.09 per share year-over-year driven by lower share count, partially offset by a higher tax rate. Please turn to Slide 6. Fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow was $1.7 billion, up 3% year-on-year, with conversion of 131%, up 18 percentage points versus last year's Q4. During the quarter, we aggressively adjusted manufacturing production levels to end market trends, which drove a sequential reduction in inventory levels by $250 million. For the full year, adjusted free cash flow was $4.7 billion with adjusted free cash flow conversion of 82%. Capital expenditures were $506 million in the quarter and $1.75 billion for the year, or up 9% year-on-year as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. Looking to 2023, we expect capital expenditures in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, which includes approximately $200 million of investment in water stewardship related to our exit of PFAS manufacturing. During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $820 million and share repurchases of $540 million. For the year, we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders, including $3.4 billion in dividends and $1.5 billion in share repurchases. In addition, we reduced our outstanding share count by 16 million shares via an exchange offer associated with the Food Safety divestiture. Having a strong balance sheet and capital structure remains a priority for 3M, because of the flexibility it provides. Net debt at the end of Q4 stood at $12 billion, down 4% year-on-year with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.4 times. Please turn to slide 8 for our business group performance. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.7 billion or up 1.3% organically. This result included a year-on-year headwind of approximately $165 million due to the ongoing decline in demand for disposable respirators. Excluding disposable respirators, Safety and Industrial grew Q4 organic sales by 7.5%. Our Personal Safety business declined mid-single digits organically, primarily due to the decline in disposable respirator demand. Turning to the rest of Safety and Industrial. Organic growth was led by low double-digit increases in electrical markets, automotive aftermarket and abrasives. Industrial adhesives and tapes and closure and masking systems both declined low single digits. Operationally, the Safety and Industrial team drove strong execution during the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income was $611 million, or up 9% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 22.4%, up 2.7 percentage points as the team managed inflation with price actions, drove yield and efficiency and exercised strong spending discipline, while also investing in the business. Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which posted sales of $2.1 billion, or up 1.4% organically. Our auto OEM business increased mid-teens versus a 2% increase in global car and light truck builds. We continue to gain penetration on new automotive platforms, while also benefiting from a favorable comparison due to last year's Q4 channel inventory drawdown. Our electronics business declined 10% organically as it continued to be impacted by the significant end market weakness particularly for smartphones, tablets and TVs. Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Advanced materials grew organically low double digits, while both commercial solutions and transportation safety increased low single digits. Transportation and Electronics delivered $366 million in adjusted operating income, down 3% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 17.8%, up 60 basis points versus Q4 last year. The team was able to more than offset manufacturing productivity headwinds and inflationary pressures with ongoing benefits from pricing, along with strong spending discipline and restructuring actions, while investing in the business. Looking at our Healthcare business, Q4 sales were $2 billion, with organic growth of 1.9% versus last year. Sales in our medical solutions business declined low single digits organically. Fourth quarter elective health care procedure volumes were approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels as nurse labor shortages and strained hospital budgets continue to impact the pace of recovery. Oral care was up low single digits despite decreased consumer spending on discretionary items. And finally, separation and purification organic sales increased high single digits while Health Information Systems was up mid-single digits. Health Care's fourth quarter operating income was $421 million, down 18% year-on-year. Operating margins were 20.6%, down 2.9 percentage points, with adjusted EBITDA margins of nearly 29%. Year-on-year operating margins were impacted by manufacturing productivity headwinds, increased raw materials and logistics costs, along with investments in the business. These headwinds were partially offset by pricing actions along with the strong spending discipline. Lastly, our consumer business posted fourth quarter sales of $1.2 billion. Organic sales declined 5.7% year-on-year with particular weakness in the US, which was down high single digits. All businesses declined organically as consumers pull back on discretionary spending and retailers aggressively took actions to reduce their inventories, particularly in the US. Looking ahead, we anticipate those trends to continue at least through the first half of 2023. Consumers fourth quarter operating income was $224 million, down 24% compared to last year, with operating margins of 17.9%, down 3.3 percentage points year-on-year. This year-on-year decline in operating margins was driven by increased end market weakness, higher raw materials and logistics and outsourced hard goods manufacturing costs, manufacturing productivity headwinds, along with investments in the business. These headwinds were partially offset by selling price actions and strong spending discipline. I'll now turn it back over to Mike for a recap of our full year 2022 performance. Please turn to slide nine.\nMike Roman: Thank you, Monish. 2022 was a pivotal year for 3M. Throughout the year, we took decisive actions that are foundational to our future and at the same time, maintained our focus on our customers. We addressed inflation through selling price actions and proactively managed cost as demand softened throughout the year. To address supply chain disruptions, we did what was necessary to serve customers and reduce cycle times, including opening a new distribution center on the East Coast. We navigated COVID-related lockdowns in China. We reached agreement with the Flemish government to restart operations in Zwijndrecht and exited our Russia business. As always, we put 3M science to work to solve customer needs across our market-leading businesses. In Safety and Industrial, our new robotic paint repair system received multiple prestigious honors, as we continue to drive innovation in automotive manufacturing, an area we led in for more than 100 years. In Consumer, we launched Scotch cushion lock, a sustainable alternative to plastic wrap, which was recognized by Fast Company as one of its world-changing ideas. In Health Care, we advanced our leadership in wound care, which includes our negative pressure wound therapies, becoming the first solution of its kind to surpass 2,000 peer-reviewed studies. In Transportation and Electronics, we introduced new thermal barrier films to improve performance of electric car batteries, one element of our $0.5 billion automotive electrification platform, which delivered 30% organic growth in 2022. Company-wide, for the total year, we delivered organic growth of 1%, or 3% excluding the impact of disposable respirators and our Russia exit. We posted adjusted EPS of $10.10, along with adjusted free cash flow of $4.7 billion with an adjusted conversion rate of 82%. We strengthened our balance sheet and reduced net debt by $0.5 billion, ending 2022 with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.4. This enabled us to invest in the business and returned $4.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. At the same time, we took actions to position us for the long-term. We divested our Food Safety business, receiving $1 billion and reducing our outstanding share count by 16 million. We continue to progress in our health care spin-off, which will create two world-class public companies better positioned to drive growth and value creation. With respect to combat arms litigation, as last week's report from the Chapter 11 co-mediators indicated, 3M continues to support Aearo Technologies in this ongoing confidential mediation process. We continue to address PFAS litigation by defending ourselves in court or negotiating resolutions as appropriate. We also announced we will exit all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. Our decision is based on careful consideration of the external landscape, including regulatory trends and changing stakeholder expectations. We simplified and streamlined our supply chain organization and advanced our digital strategies to better serve customers. We followed through on our sustainability commitments. We are ahead of schedule installing state-of-the-art filtration technologies and factories around the world. We now have capabilities up and running at all three of our largest water using sites in the US and in centric [ph]. We supported employee health, safety and well-being, including new flexible work arrangements and factory investments and we advanced diversity, equity and inclusion, with each of our business groups now executing initiatives. The steps we took in 2022 and the steps we are continuing to take in 2023, position us well as we look toward the future. Please turn to Slide 11. We expect market and macroeconomic challenges to persist in 2023. Based on this outlook, we expect organic growth of minus 3% to flat, along with adjusted EPS of $8.50 to $9, and adjusted free cash flow conversion of 90% to 100%. Our expectations reflect the slowing in demand we are seeing as we start 2023. Supply chains are improving. However, we still see headwinds from material availability and inflation, albeit at a lower level. We are not satisfied with our progress or performance. We are taking additional actions, building on the actions taken in the second half of 2022 to reduce cost structure and inventory. We have implemented strict control of hiring and discretionary spending. Today, we announced that we will reduce approximately 2,500 global manufacturing roles, a necessary decision to further align with adjusted production volumes. In addition to the actions we are taking to respond to the macroeconomic environment, we are taking a deeper look at everything we do as we prepare for the Health Care spend. As we move through the year, we will take additional actions to improve supply chain performance, drive simplification and bring us even closer to our customers. At the same time, we win in the market because we stay close to customers and continue to invest in innovation even in the most difficult times. We will continue to invest in growth opportunities in our businesses, aligned to global trends that take best advantage of our innovation. Automotive electrification, industrial automation, biopharma processing and home improvement are just a few examples of large, fast-growing markets where we are investing and where 3M innovation can make a difference. We will continue to prepare for the spin-off of our Health Care business, which presents a tremendous value creation opportunity while at the same time, preparing 3M for future success. We will work to resolve litigation we face following through on the actions we initiated in 2022. Underpinning all of our work will be the strengths of 3M, our people, our industry-leading innovation, our advanced manufacturing, our global capabilities and our iconic brands. I am confident in our future as we exit 2023, we will be a stronger, leaner and more focused 3M. Monish will now cover the details of our outlook. Monish?\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you, Mike. Please turn to slide 12. The macroeconomic environment remains very fluid and uncertain. For 2023, we anticipate that GDP and IPI will continue to moderate with both currently estimated to be around 1.5% or about half of 2022 levels. Therefore, against this backdrop, we feel it prudent to set our expectations to reflect this reality. As Mike mentioned, we estimate our full year adjusted organic sales growth to be in the range of minus 3% to flat. This includes selling prices up low single digits. Therefore, organic volumes are expected to be down low to mid-single digits for the year. This range also includes an estimated two percentage point headwind from the ongoing decline in disposable respirator demand, along with the impact of our exit from Russia. We currently expect our disposable respirator demand to be down to pre-pandemic levels. As the strength of the US dollar carries into 2023, we estimate a foreign currency translation impact to sales of minus 1% to minus 2%. And divestitures that were completed in 2022 will be a headwind to sales of nearly one percentage point. Adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of $8.50 to $9 per share. This range includes a combined earnings headwind of $0.55 to $0.80 per share year-on-year from the following three items. First, the expected sales decline of disposable respirators and exit of Russia will be an impact of minus $0.30 to minus $0.45. Second, foreign currency will be a headwind of minus $0.10 to $0.20; and third, divestiture impacts would be a minus $0.15. In addition, the 2022 carryover impact of higher raw material and logistics costs, combined with energy inflation, creates a year-on-year headwind of approximately $150 million to $250 million or roughly $0.20 to $0.35 to EPS. And finally, non-operating items are estimated to be an impact to earnings per share of flat to minus $0.10. This range includes a year-on-year increase in non-operating pension expense of $125 million. A full year adjusted tax rate in the range of 18% to 19% and a lower year-on-year outstanding share count. While there are a number of headwinds to earnings in 2023, ultimately, our full year performance will be driven by organic sales volumes, sustained progress in global supply chains and raw material availability, and our ability to drive improvements and reduce costs in our manufacturing and supply chain operations. Finally, full year adjusted free cash flow conversion is forecasted to be in the range of 90% to 100%. This range includes the continued healing of global supply chain, expected improvements in working capital performance, particularly inventory reductions and full year capital expenditures of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, which includes approximately $200 million of investment in water stewardship related to our exit of PFAS manufacturing. Please turn to slide 13. Looking at our expected performance by business. We see Safety and Industrial organic sales growth to be down low single digits in 2023. This includes an estimated decline in disposable respirator sales of $450 million to $550 million or a negative impact of approximately four percentage points as the business returns to pre-pandemic levels. Demand across industrial end markets is moderating as customers remain cautious. Our Safety and Industrial team will also be monitoring the recovery of industrial production activity in China as we start the year. Adjusted organic sales growth for Transportation and Electronics, excluding the impact of the exit of PFAS manufacturing is forecasted to be down mid-single digits to flat organically. Looking across end markets, automotive unit volume production is currently forecasted to be up nearly 4% year-on-year. We also expect automotive electrification trends to remain strong as we leverage our technologies and develop new innovative solutions for our automotive OEM customers. Electronics, however, is expected to be down significantly due to weak end market demand for TVs, tablets and smartphones, along with the ongoing impact of display technology shifting to OLED from LCD. Healthcare's organic sales growth is anticipated to be up low to mid-single digits versus 2022. We expect gradual improvement in healthcare elective procedure volume as nurse labor shortages and strain hospital budgets continue to impact global healthcare systems. In oral care, we will be monitoring consumer discretionary spending and its impact on patient visits, including orthodontic care. The Healthcare team continues to create differentiated value and deliver strong margins for the attractive end markets we serve. And finally, organic sales in consumer are estimated to be down low single digits to flat as US consumers remain cautious and retailers continue to aggressively reduce the excess inventory levels. Despite these near-term challenges, the consumer team remains focused on leveraging our iconic brands and accelerating new products in 2023. Please turn to slide 14. Before we go to Q&A, I want to walk through how we are seeing the first quarter. First, three weeks into January, we are seeing continued slowing in organic sales volume as we start the year. This slow start is driven by the same weakening end market trends that impacted the finish to 2022. We expect soft consumer discretionary spending, along with retailer destocking to continue into the first quarter. Sales of electronic devices are forecasted to be down between 10% and 30% sequentially in the first quarter, while semiconductor end markets and automotive builds are down mid-single digits sequentially. Health care and oral care elective procedure volumes are expected to be at the same levels as Q4. And as we have noted, industrial end markets are mixed. And we anticipate the ongoing COVID-related challenges to continue in China and the geopolitical situation in EMEA to persist. Therefore, taking all of these items into consideration, we estimate Q1 total adjusted sales in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion versus $8.5 billion adjusted for the exit of PFAS manufacturing or down 10% to 15% year-on-year. This anticipated year-on-year decline includes headwinds of 3 to 4 percentage points from disposable respirator sales declines and Russia exit, 3 to 4 percentage points from foreign currency translation, and 1 percentage point impact from divestitures. Taking these factors into account, we expect Q1 organic sales to be down low single digits to mid-single digits. From an EPS perspective, we estimate that first quarter adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $1.25 to $1.65. This range is impacted by the continued slowing of organic sales volumes, a pre-tax restructuring charge of $75 million to $100 million or $0.10 to $0.15 per share, a tax rate of approximately 19%, along with normal Q1 items. As you can see, the first quarter presents a tough start to the year. We will have our most challenging year-on-year comps related to the declining disposable respirator demand and our exit of Russia. Ultimately, organic volume trends will be the biggest factor in determining how the quarter will turn out. 2023 is an important year as we work on progressing our strategies, including preparing for the spin off health care, improving our manufacturing and supply chain operations, and taking actions to further streamline the organization. We are focused on creating the shortest path to the customer and providing innovative solutions to their most challenging problems. We will remain nimble and take appropriate actions as we respond to changing market dynamics. And we will continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability to ensure the long-term success of our enterprise. To wrap up, I continue to be bullish on our long-term trends. The large and attractive end markets we serve provide exciting opportunities for the future of 3M. We are not satisfied with our performance and the expected start this year. We are working to aggressively address our operating performance in this challenging environment. We expect organic sales volumes will improve as consumer retail and consumer electronic markets stabilize. China works through its COVID-related challenges and as our year-on-year comps ease. We also expect supply chains to continue to heal and raw materials and logistic cost headwinds to abate. Therefore, we anticipate improvements in organic growth, operating margins, earnings and cash flow as we progress through the year. As you've heard me say before, there is always more we can do and we will do to improve our performance. I want to thank our customers and suppliers for their partnerships and the 3M employees for their hard work and dedication as they continue delivering for our customers. That concludes my remarks. We will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. You may proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Hi, good morning everybody.\nMike Roman: Good morning Scott.\nMonish Patolawala: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Davis: I was hoping you could walk us through, just perhaps logistically or opportunistically, how you exit PFAS. It's so integrated with your with your product line, your manufacturing systems. Can you sell some facilities? Can you extract some value, or is it -- or do you just have to close -- lock up the facility and walk away? And how does that work logistically?\nMike Roman: Yeah, Scott. So maybe I'll take you back to the announcement of the exit. We said we'll exit all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. We also said we would work to discontinue use of PFAS in our products broadly across the company. That's both in our products, but also in the manufacturing of our products. And I think your question is really on our manufacturing part of that. And we said we will meet contractual commitments that we have to our customers, and we're working closely with them to manage that as we make this transition. But ultimately, also, I talked about that we are not planning and won't sell the businesses and that we will plan to shut them down as we work through the transition as we get to the end of that -- end of 2025.\nMonish Patolawala: Scott, just also a reminder, as we disclosed, we said we would take -- the exit cost of this will be in the range $1.3 billion to $2.3 billion. And we took a fourth quarter charge of $800 million, that's included in that range of $1.3 billion to $2.3 billion.\nScott Davis: Okay. That's helpful. And then you talked about doing some further restructuring, perhaps help us understand the scope or scale, or at least are you talking about -- I think you mentioned 2,500 people. But are the rooftops and meaningful cost out that you see in this plan?\nMike Roman: Yeah, Scott. So the announcement we made today was 2,500 jobs in manufacturing, really is responding to the volume that we see, the outlook for the volume. And that's -- we're putting a focus on supply chain. We see an opportunity to continue to streamline our supply chain. We hope to take advantage of some of the tailwinds or supply chain\u2019s heel, as Monish talked about. We're taking actions ourselves, and we're looking at what additional actions we can take there. And we're looking deeper in the company as well as we work to prepare for the healthcare spend, we've been looking at 3M ParentCo as well. And how do we simplify, streamline and put our position ourselves closer to customers. So it's really looking deeper and broader. And I think taking actions, proactively taking actions against the outlook we have for our markets.\nScott Davis: All right. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on guys. Appreciate it.\nMike Roman: Yeah. See you, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. You may proceed with your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, everyone. \nMike Roman: Hey, Andy.\nMonish Patolawala: Good morning, Andy.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Mike or Monish, you mentioned that industrial end markets are moderating, customers are cautious. I think for instance, you mentioned industrial adhesives and tapes down in Q4. Has there been a material change from conversations that you've had previously with industrial customers, or is this just gradual moderation? And then is the regional weakness that you're seeing in China just a function of COVID interruption and more consumer base versus end demand related? And how do you think that pans out in 2023?\nMike Roman: Yeah. Andy, back to Monish's comments, we're seeing kind of mixed performance in the industrial markets. We see strengths as we said, as we came through the quarter in areas like electrical markets and automotive aftermarket. We were seeing some moderation in specific end market segments. And the comment about industrial adhesives and tapes and closure and masking is some of that is related to the electronics slowdown. So that's part of that impact. It's also impacted by China. So China has really got a couple of things that are part of the slowdown. One of them is COVID and the interruption in the markets in industrial production and GDP. It's also reflecting the importance of electronics to that market into our business there in China. And we see that continuing those dynamics that we saw in Q4 continuing into the start of the New Year. We saw some moderation in specific segments of industrial. We saw specialty vehicle construction markets. We saw some moderation coming through the end of the quarter. We're off to a slow start as we start the year. There's a couple of areas of destocking really related to those end market segments where we've seen nothing more broad-based than that. We had strong performance across some of those other end markets in industrial. But \u2013 we're starting to see some moderating and, like I said, January is off to a slower start for industrial.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Mike, that's helpful. And then maybe could you give us a little more color regarding price versus cost expectations for 2023. You mentioned the low single-digit price improvement you're seeing. You also mentioned supply chains are healing. Are you generally seeing pricing hold up for you despite some of this demand weakness across the portfolio? And then versus raw material and energy related headwinds, does that price versus cost equationgetting increasingly green as you go throughout the year?\nMonish Patolawala: Yeah. So I think two different points in there, Andy. As you correctly pointed out, the carryover impact on what we have assumed right now in the guide is two pieces on the selling price. We said approximately 2% -- at the same time, the carryover impact of both raw materials and energy inflation is approximately $150 million to $250 million. So when you just do that equation together, right now, it's positive. I think what we'll see as we go through is how do supply chains heal and how fast can we get the cost out. But at the same time, it will take a little bit of time as we sell through our higher cost goods to our inventory, you're going to see some of that moderate, but it will start showing up as the year progresses. The key question for us that we have to think through and that's what we are thinking through is, as deflation starts showing up in the economy, the discussion that's going to come up is the elasticity of price across not just our company but across all companies. And what we have found over time, Andy, as you know, 3M so well that our innovation ultimately drives the value that we add for our customers. And historically, we have been able to have a good price cost equation, because of the value that we add for customers. So, seeing what we'll see in 2023 will depend on supply chains and what plays out in the long run, we are very confident that the price/cost equation continues to be green just because of the value we add to our customers.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Appreciate the color, Monish.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin: Yes. Good morning.\nMike Roman: Hi, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Just few questions. What are you guys just -- and if I missed it, I apologize, but are you sort of modeling an explicit recession in your forecast? What are your macroeconomic assumptions? I know you sort of said things are slowing, but are you explicitly modeling a recession?\nMike Roman: Yes, Andrew, underlying our view of the year is -- the projection for the macro is part of it. And then we're talking about specific markets and dynamics that we're seeing coming through the quarter into -- coming through the fourth quarter into the New Year. So when you look at the macro global GDP, IPI in the 1.5% kind of range is the outlook for the year, you can see US softer than that, you see GDP below 1%, you see IPI even projected to turn negative as we get into the middle of the year. So those are kind of the macro dynamics that we're looking at. We're also looking closely as we talked about in a couple of these market segments. Fourth quarter, you saw this 10% to 30% decline in the consumer electronics build and that is expected and projected I would say, to continue as we get into first quarter and the first half of the year and consumer discretionary spending and the impact on the -- our end markets is -- that was in decline in Q4, I expect that to continue. So the macro is part of it, and we're looking closely at these key market segments and the indicators there. And I think it really says Q1 looks like Q4 and there are some areas of additional slowing. And then we kind of look at the total macro for the rest of the year as we shape up our outlook.\nAndrew Obin: Got you. And then the question about pricing. Just historically, given -- and I know the way you report pricing is not necessarily how we think about pricing internally. I completely appreciate that. But has anything changed in the market structure in terms of your ability to drive the pricing. I just would have thought for 3M reported pricing would have been more of a tailwind into 2023. But it is what it is, but are there any structural changes that you're seeing and that you're trying to address? Thank you.\nMike Roman: Andy, there really is two parts to our pricing actions in the near term. One of them is what Monish talked about, we are always really looking closely at our price value in the marketplace. Our innovation delivers value to our customers. We manage our pricing in the -- take advantage of that value and really make sure that we are getting that value through our broader market pricing. The last couple of years has brought in the inflation dynamic, and that's really been the driver. We are taking pricing actions to adjust for the input cost. And so you've got a mix of our innovation as well as the inflation dynamic. And so as you look into 2023, you're -- we're confident we'll continue to position ourselves in strong price value based on our innovation we are going to be managing inflation along with everyone else, how do we see that progressing, and what will we do with our prices, adjusting those if we see additional inflation and managing those as the -- I would say the elasticity in the market around inflation plays itself out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan Securities. You may proceed with your question.\nStephen Tusa: Hi, good morning.\nMike Roman: Hey, Steve.\nMonish Patolawala: Good morning, Steve.\nStephen Tusa: What are you guys seeing on the inventory side of the -- of your more industrial businesses? I think you talked a bit about auto, but maybe just on the general industrial side, customer inventory behavior?\nMike Roman: Yes. Steve, I touched on a little bit of that. I would say as we began Q4, overall inventory looked to be in pretty good shape. And that was with the notable exception of Consumer. Everyone was working to reduce the inventory, and we saw a lot of destocking efforts in consumer. As I said, we're starting to see some destocking in industrial. I would say, Asia and China, where we are seeing weaknesses in consumer electronics driving some of that. And as I mentioned earlier, some specialty markets like construction and a few other areas like even packaging, we're seeing some reduction of inventory as we start the New Year. When you look at our transportation and electronics business, the consumer electronics OEMs are reducing inventories. With that outlook for their demand, they're reacting to it. Automotive OEM inventory still remains low. It's improving, but it remains low as they're recovering from some of the supply chain disruptions. Health care, overall, looks pretty stable. We see oral care channel reacting to some of the consumer discretionary spending and slowing there in oral care that we saw really in the second half. And then it comes back, the biggest move is in the consumer where our retailers are still aggressively reducing inventory. So some dynamics reflecting some of the changes in demand in the end markets.\nStephen Tusa: Okay. And then you mentioned January was starting slow. I mean, can you give us a little bit of context? Is that -- is January an organic kind of like below the low end of the annual range? Just roughly, just some color on kind of how slow January started for you guys?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes, Steve. So back to January, yes, it is lower than the overall range. And partly, that's also driven by the toughest comps that we're going to have going into 1Q. As I mentioned, 7.2% to 7.6% -- $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion is the revenue range. It will be down 10% to 15% versus last year's adjusted. And you have to take revenue and adjusted for the exit of PFAS manufacturing, which would be around $8.5 billion. But embedded in that is 3% to 4% from foreign currency headwinds. So it's a Q4 carryover impact. You've got 1% from divestitures, which is based on the closure of the Food Safety and some of the other transactions we did in 3Q. And then you've got a very large headwind from DR and Russia. If you recall last year, we had a very strong 1Q with the Omicron variant. Plus at that time, we had not announced the exit of Russia until mid-March. So that's another 300 to 400 basis points of pressure because you've got a comp. And therefore, overall, it's LSD to MSD is what we think right now is organic sales growth for 1Q. And what you'll find is as the year goes on, these comps start getting easier and that will start showing the growth on a year-over-year basis. Hopefully that answers your question?\nStephen Tusa: Yes. You weren't down double-digit in January. Are you? Double-digit?\nMonish Patolawala: As of right now, we are somewhere in that range of where I told you.\nStephen Tusa: Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. Really appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks and good morning everybody.\nMike Roman: Morning Joe.\nMonish Patolawala: Morning Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: I know we've talked a lot about the organic growth guidance for the year. I guess I'm just curious, when you think about the consumer specifically, it seems like you're embedding improvement as the year goes along. Is that just a function of inventories getting better? How much of that is China reopening? I just want to get an understanding of that business specifically.\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So, on Consumer -- so you're right, Joe, I'll start with the summary, which is we are expecting that as things stabilize and as customers slow down their destocking, you will start seeing the comps get better in the year. The fourth quarter was extremely hard. And as Mike said, we saw an acceleration of a trend in December. We continue to see that in January, and that's why the first quarter starts pretty soft. But our hope is that as things stabilize, as destocking gets better, as consumer confidence builds into the year, we'll start seeing the consumer business starting to get better.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. That's helpful, Monish. And maybe my follow-up question is a little bit of a longer term question on the electronics business. So, specifically, I think in your comments, as you mentioned that the shift into OLED. I know there was an announcement about Apple making your own custom displays starting in 2024. Just trying to understand like how that will potentially impact your business beyond this year? And then is it already expected to impact your business in 2023?\nMonish Patolawala: What -- I would answer and then I'll ask Mike to join in. The way I look at this, Joe, is there are a couple of things. The company has always -- has been looking at the LCD-OLED transition for a period of time. And that transition has been happening for a few years and the team has continued to deal with that as it goes on. What the team is working through is as new devices are coming on, what does that mean from a OLED to LCD ratio to mix. It definitely did have an impact for us in 2022. And then we are seeing what trends we are seeing -- as of right now, the trends we saw, we have predicted into 2023. But with that said, the one thing about the Electronics segment and especially the display teams is they always have a lot of innovation that is out there that helps offset some of these headwinds that come across. That business keeps reinventing itself as time has gone. For example, Ashish and his team have launched products that are used in AR and VR technology, which also hopefully is a growth market in the future, and that's what -- that business is very good at looking at these trends, working these headwinds, and then finding innovation to offset that as time goes. But right now, we have embedded what we think is the trend in LCD-OLED shift into our 2023 guide.\nMike Roman: Yes. And Joe, I would add we've been managing that transition and that trend for some time. It's -- and it's part of our innovation that we're doing with our customers, too, innovating on both sides of that, the OLED displays. And as Monish said, the other higher growth segments in electronics, historically, our electronics business has been overweight to consumer electronics. And as we've talked about over the last few years, our strategy is continue to innovate there, and we're working with our customers multiple generations ahead, whether it's OLED displays or other applications, we're really working with them to innovate and drive value and opportunity for 3M in that consumer electronics. At the same time, we recognize the big growth drivers are some of these other higher growth segments. And Monish talked about AR, VR now emerging as one of those opportunities. Automotive electrification, of course, is the largest of those right now. There's other areas like factory automation, and even into electronic, into semiconductor manufacturing kinds of processes. So we are innovating in those spaces and at the same time, looking ahead and managing through the next display technologies and the next mobile device technologies and consumer electronics.\nJoe Ritchie: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: Good morning. Maybe just wanted to start on the operating margins. So, sort of, backing into what you've talked about, are we right in assuming that the guide embeds sort of 19% operating margin for the year and sort of mid-teens in Q1? And then, on that Q1 aspect, very heavy decremental margins sequentially, even without the restructuring charge. Is there a lot of sort of under production going on at 3M to clear out inventory, for example? Just trying to understand why that Q1 margin is so light. I think, it's like a 50% decremental or something excluding the restructuring.\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So as I've always said, Julian, first is, volume gives us the best leverage. And what you have seen in Q4 continues into Q1. As we have said in Q4, we took some aggressive actions on making sure we rightsized our manufacturing facilities to help control inventory. Our plan is we will continue to aggressively manage production as a way to -- manage production as a way to manage cash at the same time. So we're not building unnecessary inventory. So that's number one. I think number two is, as I mentioned, there's continued pressure on a year-over-year basis on foreign currency between 3% to 4%. If you look at it versus fourth quarter exit rate, it's pretty much, I would say, flat to what fourth quarter exit rate was. And then the other item, you mentioned the restructuring, but we also have other normal 1Q items that we have from an accounting basis that we take, which is normal in every quarter. And that's why the start to 1Q is slower. But as you accelerate or move through the year, volume and the supply chain healing are the two factors that will continue to drive us to get these margins better. And if we're looking at it on a year-over-year basis, it's all driven by the comps that we had last year, which impact us heavily. So its lower volume in Q1, that's a big driver and volume will be the big determinant on what we think Q1 is going to be.\nJulian Mitchell: And, Monish, is that roughly right on that sort of mid-teens operating margin Q1 and 19-ish for the year in your guide?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. Yes, it's actually close there. It's close enough, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: Okay. Thanks a lot. And then one quick follow-up on that for Mike. Mike, you've announced a restructuring program today. I think it's the first kind of formal discrete one since fourth quarter of 2020. And you had the business transformation savings program prior to that. Just wondered, sort of, when you think about the scope of the current restructuring plan, what kind of savings run rate we should expect annually when do you get to that? And how do you assess the scope of this being enough to get margins back on track as you had those prior restructuring programs, but margins have stayed under pressure? Thank you.\nMike Roman: Yeah, Julian, the way we're thinking about it. And like I said, this is certainly taking on what we see in the markets and in our performance and the supply chain dynamics that we're facing, all of that's part of what we're focused on as we look at these actions as we go through the year, adding to what we've already announced. And then we are thinking and getting ready for the spin off healthcare. We're taking a deeper look, as I said, at everything we do. There's opportunities to streamline what we do as a company in the face of those end market dynamics and our operations. And we're learning from the changes that we've made to this point. So we'll continue to work on that. In terms of giving you a view of the impact of that, that's something we'll come back with as we make decisions and announce those actions, those additional actions as we go through there.\nJulian Mitchell: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone and thank you for all the 2023 planning assumption details.\nMike Roman: Morning, Deane.\nMonish Patolawala: Hi, Deane.\nDeane Dray: And also for providing first quarter guidance, I know that's not a typical practice but given all the moving parts, we appreciate that. So my question relates -- it's come up a couple of times on the healthcare spin. Can you remind us the timing that you're expecting? There was some noise about the potential challenges in the courts. Where does that stand? And on the separation costs, how much is this impacting 2023, or is that all excluded and stranded costs? How quickly would you be able to address those? Thank you.\nMike Roman: Yeah, Deane, maybe I'll talk a little bit about just the spin. Monish, can talk about the separation cost model. We have a dedicated team working and building the execution plans. We're making very good progress. We talked about our expectation that we would be completing the spin by the end of 2023, early 2024 and that's the focus for the teams as they work to execute this. You commented on there had been some -- actually, there was a suit in the marketplace around the spin of healthcare and would we be able to complete that. And that was something that was dismissed. And so there's nothing from that dynamic that's impacting us. It's really about our teams working to execute the spin. And as I said, they're making very good progress. We're confident that we're moving in the right direction and moving ahead at pace.\nMonish Patolawala: So as regards to the guide, Deane, as we had disclosed when we announced the spin off healthcare, we currently do not be -- we are thinking of counting it as a special item, so that will be excluded from our ongoing operations. We are unable to predict how much of that will show up in 2023, so we haven't put that in our guide. But when we announced the transaction, we had given you a framework that our transaction cost of spin-off will be somewhere in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion, which is a mixture of CapEx and OpEx. The teams are continuing to work that as they go through right now. We've now been at this for the last four to five months. So as we get better estimates around that, we will definitely keep you posted. And then as regards stranded cost, as Mike mentioned, and we had also mentioned it in the last quarter, this is an opportunity for us to look at everything that we do as we are getting ready for the spin. And our goal is to reduce stranded costs as much as we can, and we'll keep working it as we go through it. And we'll definitely let you all know as we figure this out. But the teams are actively working. The teams are staffed and they're doing an amazing job keeping the program on track.\nDeane Dray: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. We've covered a lot of ground here. But I want to go back to 1Q 2023, perhaps Monish. We calculate a 15% margin, which is kind of similar to Julian's mid-teens. I don't think we've ever seen a margin that low. I think the GFC, we saw 17% and change margin. So just wondering why margins will be so low. And I understand supply chain is a factor here, but why 15%? What's going on? And as part of this sort of question, the kind of the coverage of the full year plan even at the low end of the range is still really, really low. So I think it's about 17% to 19% coverage, making a very big back-end loaded year. So I know you said volume gets better, but what gives you confidence and what can give investors confidence enough capture in the back half of the year?\nMonish Patolawala : Yes. So I think two different questions and both great ones. So I'll try to answer the first one, similar to what I told Julian. Volume gives us the best leverage. And when you just look at it even sequentially and you adjust for FX, which helped us versus a guide that we had given volumes are going to be flat. We have started very low in the month of January, and that puts tremendous pressure on our fixed cost, number one. Number two, we have a restructuring charge. And then number three, our tax rate is 19%. And then, of course, we have another normal 1Q items from an accounting basis that we take. So when you put all that together, I would say, Nigel, it comes down to volume. Volume is down 10% to 15% on a year-over-year basis. And so that's number one. This is the toughest comp and you have DR and the exit of Russia, both of which we have disclosed in the past. When you apply them at company margin, which is at 46%, that puts pressure also on a year-over-year basis. When I go through the remaining quarter year and as you correctly asked the question, what happens on margins, as you start thinking about we exit some of these comps that are difficult, 1Q being the toughest, volumes will start, our comps will start getting better. The supply chain efficiencies, the actions that we have announced also in 1Q and some of the actions we took in 4Q will all start showing up in the remaining of the year. Again, as I mentioned, some of these items, including cost out from raw materials take a little bit of time as we work through our higher cost of inventory through the system. If you also look at external data, and that's what we can look at because none of us are able to predict what we can in the future, external data says the second half gets better. It gets better in China, it gets better globally. And that's another reason why we are hopeful that as volumes come back in the second half, we should see our own margins go up and our own revenue go up. But with that said, at the end of the day, we control -- we don't control the markets, but what we definitely control is our own actions. And so continuing to drive supply chain efficiency, continuing to make sure that we are being as nimble and agile as we can. Using Mike's words, we are looking at everything. We're being very careful and discretionary in hiring. And 2023 is an important year for year. It's a year that we plan to execute on a lot of our strategies over the last few years, including the spin of our health care and improving our supply chain operations. I just want to end with your question, we are not satisfied with where we are. We're going to continue to look at this. We're going to continue to be nimble and agile as the volume plays itself out. And our goal is to keep building from where we are right now.\nBruce Jermeland: Hey, Nigel, I just want to correct one thing Monish said. Our total sales for Q1 are going to be down 10% to 15%, not volume.\nMonish Patolawala: I'm sorry. Yeah.\nBruce Jermeland: Organic sales growth is forecast to be down low single digits to mid-single digits.\nNigel Coe: Okay. I was going to follow-up on that. Thanks for that clarification. Bruce. And I know, I've asked a few questions there, but I do have one for Mike. You said, everything on the table in terms of your reorganization and things about new ways of doing things, five or six years ago, 3M went through a sort of pretty big centralization of supply chain and business support functions. In hindsight, has that left the organization a bit too rigid? Was that the right move? And could you unwind that stabilization?\nMike Roman: Yeah, I would say that, Nigel that, the change is that \u2013 there's a couple of different changes that we made to the supply chain maybe that you're thinking about. One was we did take actions on some of the structure and really looking at factories, our footprint of factories a number of years ago. And then we moved to \u2013 when we announced the change to our business group led model, we went to a common supply chain model globally. And we made some additional steps in that in last year, really to continue to drive more flexibility, greater streamlined performance end-to-end in our supply chain. So, we see it really more as an opportunity to build on the changes we have made and drive simplification, streamline, more productivity, reducing our costs, delivering more directly to customers. So it's continuing to build on some of those changes. I think those actually have positioned us to be more flexible as we go ahead. And there's an expectation that supply chains will continue to heal. So we want to be able to take advantage of those of those tailwinds that we hope to see as we go through the year. At the same time, we control what we control, and that is making additional changes based on what we've learned to, to really execute our performance in our supply chain. It's the biggest opportunity we have to improve margin and cash flow as we go through the year.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question.\nDan Rizzo: Hi. This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Thanks. Thanks for fitting me in. I don't know, if I missed this or not, but you mentioned that free cash flow conversion is 90% to 100% this year. Is that long-term goal? Can you maintain that? I mean, as things kind of, I guess, will get less volatile in the out years?\nMonish Patolawala: Yeah, it's 90% to 100% for 2023, just to be clear, that was the guide.\nDan Rizzo: Right.\nMonish Patolawala: For last year, we ended at 82%. As I've said multiple times, the opportunity for 3M's cash from a working capital comes from inventory management and EP. And to answer your question, is it sustainable, of course, it will ultimately depend on the income that we generated depends on how supply chains behave and the capital. But if you just look at the ability for us to use data and data analytics to help drive inventory and working capital clearly exists. In the fourth quarter, the teams did an amazing job to take inventories down, got it down by nearly $250 million. And as supply chains start to heal, this is clearly an opportunity for us, and we're going to keep driving that.\nDan Rizzo: All right. Thank you very much.\nMonish Patolawala: Thanks.\nOperator: We have no further phone questions at this time.\nMike Roman: To wrap up, we are focused on creating value for customers and shareholders in a challenging environment. We will continue to take actions to improve our performance, control costs and drive simplification while building 3M for the future.

Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to these slides and in the attachments to today\u2019s press release. With that, please turn to slide three, and I will now hand the call off to Mike. Mike?\nMike Roman: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We continue to execute our strategies to deliver for our customers, position 3M for long-term growth and manage legal matters. Our team posted organic growth of 2% or more than 3%, excluding the impact of the decline in disposable respirator sales, along with adjusted margins of 21.5%, adjusted EPS of $2.69 and $1.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow. While the global economic outlook is softening, our businesses continue to innovate for customers and capitalize on opportunities. Transportation and Electronics posted 3% organic growth, with Safety and Industrial, Consumer and Healthcare, each growing 2%. All business groups delivered margins above 21%, with notable margin expansion in Safety and Industrial, and Transportation and Electronics. Looking geographically, organic growth was led by APAC up 3%, with China up 8%, benefiting from backlog recovery following the COVID-related lockdowns in the second quarter. The Americas were up 2%, with the U.S. flat, against 6% growth in last year\u2019s Q3. Growth in EMEA was flat, as we navigate the ongoing geopolitical unrest across Europe. At the same time, we drove operational improvements to address inflation and supply chain challenges. We are delivering strong pricing, managing costs and reducing inventory backlogs, while maintaining a relentless focus on serving customers. For example, we recently invested in a new shipping consolidation center in South Carolina, which is reducing average cycle times for exports to Asia by one week to two weeks. Some of our actions have impacted near-term margins, but we will continue to do what is necessary to take care of customers. Going forward, we see a significant opportunity to reduce cost of goods sold and working capital as global supply chains improve, which includes leveraging data and data analytics to drive productivity in our plants. With respect to guidance, today we are updating full year expectations to reflect our results through nine months, along with the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar and ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. For organic growth, we are lowering the high end of our range to 1.5% to 2%, against the prior range of 1.5% to 3.5%. We anticipate adjusted EPS of $10.10 to $10.35, against the previous expectation of $10.30 to $10.80. We are also updating our range for adjusted free cash flow conversion to 85% to 95% from 90% to 100% previously. To strengthen 3M for the future, we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. For example, while we see near-term softness in consumer electronics, we are investing in Electronic segments that are seeing strong growth, including new solutions for automotive displays, and virtual and augmented reality. We are rolling out new thermal management solutions to improve electric car batteries, one element of our work to advance more sustainable vehicle designs. And earlier this month, we introduced a new posted app for Microsoft Teams that helps people collaborate in hybrid environments, as we execute our digital strategy and re-imagine our products. We are also innovating to make our operation safer, more efficient and more productive. At our plant in Alexandria, Minnesota, we are leveraging 3M disruptive technologies to transform our abrasive belt converting process through end-to-end automation, improving labor productivity by 32%, eliminating nine high-risk tasks and saving nearly $1 million annually. Many more similar projects are on the way across our global operations, driving safety and savings. In sustainability, we have installed a new state-of-the-art water filtration system in Cordova, Illinois. We now have all three of our largest water using sites in the U.S., utilizing industry-leading filtration technologies following through on the $1 billion sustainability commitment we made last year. At the same time, we are positioning 3M for long-term success by actively managing our portfolio, complementing all we do to strengthen our enterprise organically. Last month, we completed the divestiture of our Food Safety business, which unlocks value and further strengthens our balance sheet. We received approximately $1 billion and reduced our outstanding share count by $16 million. In addition, earlier this month, we divested two of our skin care brands in Southeast Asia, enabling us to prioritize other parts of our consumer portfolio. We have also established a dedicated team to seamlessly execute our healthcare spin-off. We are confident in our plan to create two world-class public companies with greater focus and better able to drive growth and innovation. Before turning the call to Monish, I would like to provide an update on litigation, which I know is top of mind. On Combat Arms, the Aearo Technologies Chapter 11 proceeding is active and progressing and we believe it is the best path to resolving claims in an equitable, efficient, prompt and permanent manner. That continues to be our goal, a resolution that is equitable and more certain for all parties. Aearo is participating in a confidential mediation process focused on reaching a comprehensive settlement and 3M is supporting those efforts. Aearo has also appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision in August not to extend the stay of litigation to 3M and the Seventh Circuit has agreed to hear the appeal. In the MDL, the next trial is scheduled for February of next year. We also continue to actively manage PFAS litigation. Earlier this month, we reached a settlement with the City of Gadsden, Alabama related to carpet manufacturing. The first AFFF MDL trial is now scheduled for June of 2023. In summary, we continue to deliver for customers in an uncertain environment. I thank our employees for their contributions and commitment, especially as we continue to lead through significant change and position 3M for the future. We will stay focused on driving growth, improving operational execution and delivering greater value for customers and shareholders. I will now turn it over to Monish for more details on the quarter. Monish? \nMonish Patolawala: Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 4. Overall, the 3M team delivered third quarter sales and operating margins that were very much in line with my comments at a conference in mid-September. With some puts and takes, as consumer and consumer electronics demand declined as the quarter progressed, while industrial end markets demand remained steady. Third quarter total sales were $8.6 billion or down 3.6% year-on-year, which included headwinds of 5.1% of $450 million from foreign currency translation and 50 basis points of $50 million from the divestiture of Food Safety, along with the deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies. On an organic basis, third quarter sales increased 2% versus last year. This result includes an anticipated falloff in disposable respirator demand, which negatively impacted organic sales by approximately $130 million or 1.4 percentage points. Excluding this decline, Q3 organic sales growth was 3.4%. On an adjusted basis, third quarter operating income was $1.9 billion, with operating margins of 21.5%, which were up 40 basis points year-on-year and 50 basis points sequentially. Adjusted earnings for the quarter were $2.69 versus $2.58 last year. Turning to the components that impacted third quarter operating margins and earnings year-on-year performance. As you may recall, during our Investor Day this past February, we laid out our operating framework and operating principles that included daily management, data democratization, transparency and accountability. We continue to make progress in the consistency of application of this framework. By embracing these principles, along with taking self-help actions, the team executed well in the quarter as we continue to navigate the fluid and uncertain macro and geopolitical environment. We continue to focus on serving our customers and drive additional actions, including recovering our sales backlog in China from the April and May COVID-related lockdowns, implementing appropriate selling price actions to address ongoing inflation, maintaining strong spending discipline, implementing targeted productivity actions to adjust businesses to end market demand trends while driving simplification and continuing to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability to ensure we are all well positioned for long-term success. These actions helped to more than offset a number of headwinds in the quarter, including the decline in disposable respirator sales, which negatively impacted Q3 operating margins by 30 basis points and earnings by $0.07 a share; incremental end market softness particularly in consumer electronics, along with oral care and consumer retail in the U.S. as persistent inflationary pressures are slowing consumer spending; ongoing global supply chain challenges and raw material constraints; and finally, geopolitical impacts, particularly Russia, which was a year-on-year headwind of $50 million to revenue and $0.03 to earnings per share. In total, our operating framework and self-help actions resulted in an overall net benefit to operating margins of 2.9 percentage points and $0.41 to earnings. Moving to raw material and logistics inflation. As I have noted over last several quarters, inflationary pressures remain persistent and are broad-based. Therefore, we continue to experience year-on-year headwind with a Q3 cost increase of approximately $225 million or a negative impact of 2.6 percentage points to operating margins and $0.31 to earnings. Our full year raw materials and logistics inflation estimate of $750 million to $850 million remains unchanged. And as we have said before, we continue to expect to offset this through pricing actions. The strength of the U.S. dollar continued to affect total revenue as foreign currency translation was a negative 5% impact. As a result, we had a benefit of 10 basis points to margins, however, incurred a headwind of $0.12 to earnings per share. As Mike mentioned, we have been actively managing our portfolio. On September 1st, we closed the Food Safety divestiture, resulting in approximately $1 billion in consideration received, along with reducing outstanding share count by 16 million via an exchange offer. However, we lost one month of sales and income from Food Safety in the quarter. Therefore, the lost sales and income from food safety, along with the deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies resulted in a year-on-year headwind of $0.02 to earnings per share in the quarter. Finally, other financial items increased earnings by a net $0.15 per share year-on-year, driven equally by benefits from a lower share count along with a lower-than-expected tax rate. The lower third quarter adjusted tax rate was primarily the result of favorable outcomes from prior year audit settlements and geographic income mix. Looking at the full year, we now expect our adjusted tax rate in the range of 17.5% to 18.5% versus 18.5% to 19.5% previously. Please turn to Slide 5. Third quarter adjusted free cash flow was $1.4 billion, with conversion of 88%, an improvement from first half performance as we drive working capital intensity, including improved inventory levels, while also increasing CapEx for growth and sustainability investments. We remain focused on working capital improvement as we continue to navigate through a fluid supply chain environment. Even though the environment remains challenging, we are realizing benefits from our efforts as we leverage the use of data and data analytics to reduce inventory levels through better demand planning and optimized customer payment terms. We expect to continue to realize benefits from our actions as we move forward. Capital expenditures were $435 million in the quarter and $1.2 billion year-to-date are up 19% year-on-year as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. Based upon the current status of supply chains and pace of projects, we now expect full year CapEx investments in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.85 billion. During the quarter, we returned $1 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $850 million and share repurchases of $155 million. On a year-to-date basis, we returned $3.5 billion to shareholders, including $2.6 billion in dividends and $900 million in share repurchases. In addition, we reduced our outstanding share count by $16 million via an exchange offer associated with the Food Safety divestiture. Both dividends and share repurchases remain important pillars of our capital allocation strategy. We continue to see the current value of the stock as a very attractive opportunity and have resumed share repurchase activity following the Food Safety divestiture. Having a strong balance sheet and capital structure remains a priority for 3M, because of the flexibility it provides us to continue to invest organically in the business, pursue strategic M&A opportunities and return cash to shareholders while navigating legal matters. Net debt at the end of Q3 stood at $12.1 billion, down 3% year-on-year and down over 30% since 2019. Please turn to Slide 7 for our business group performance for Q3. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.9 billion or up 1.7% organically compared to last year\u2019s third quarter. This result included a year-on-year headwind of approximately $130 million due to the ongoing decline in demand for disposable respirators. Excluding disposable respirators, Safety and Industrial posted Q3 organic growth of over 6%, driven by broad-based performance along with the backlog recovery in China from the April and May COVID-related lockdowns. Our Personal Safety business declined low double digits organically, primarily due to the decline in COVID-related disposable respirator demand. Turning to the rest of Safety and Industrial, organic growth was led by low-teen increases in both automotive aftermarket and roofing granules. Electrical markets and abrasives grew high-single digits, while closure and masking systems and industrial adhesives and tapes delivered mid single-digit growth. Operationally, the Safety and Industrial team drove strong execution during the third quarter, delivering adjusted operating income of $673 million, up 8% versus last year and up 7% sequentially versus Q2. Adjusted operating margins were 23.2%, up 2.5 percentage points as the team managed inflation with price actions drove yield and efficiency, and exercise strong spending discipline. The Safety and Industrial Business Group continues to focus on investing for the future, including in digital platforms such as repair stack for connected automotive body shops and sustainable platforms like thermal barriers for auto electrification. Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which posted sales of $2.2 billion or up 3% organically compared to last year. Overall growth was benefited by COVID-related backlog recovery in the Greater China region, which was partially offset by increased weakness in consumer electronics demand, along with the continued constraints in the semiconductor supply chain. Our electronics-related business declined mid-single digits organically, with decreases across consumer electronics, particularly smartphones, tablets and TVs. These declines were partially offset by continued strong demand for our solutions in semiconductor, factory automation and automotive end markets. Organic sales in our auto OEM business were up 21% year-on-year, as compared to an estimated 27% increase in car and light truck builds. As you may recall, we outperformed last year\u2019s Q3 build rate by nearly 20 percentage points as we benefit from a channel inventory build, which was unwound in Q4 last year. Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Commercial Solutions grew organically high single digits, while Advanced Materials grew mid-single digits and Transportation Safety was down low single digits. Despite the continued fluid end market environment, the Transportation and Electronics team delivered strong operating performance. Third quarter operating income increased 9% to $474 million, with operating margins of 21.2%, up 2.5 percentage points year-on-year. Operating margins were benefited by price actions as we navigated inflationary pressures along with the strong spending discipline. The Transportation and Electronics business group is investing to solve some of the toughest challenges in the market and executing for future growth. For example, in Q3, we opened a new battery component testing lab to support accelerating opportunities in automotive electrification. Looking at our Healthcare business, which delivered Q3 sales of $2.1 billion, with organic growth of 1.7% versus last year\u2019s strong 8% comparison. Our Medical Solutions, Food Safety, Separation and Purification, and Health Information Systems businesses all increased low-single digits organically. While we did have organic growth in Separation and Purification year-on-year, Biopharma was down in the U.S. due to last year\u2019s strong demand for COVID therapeutics. Third quarter elective medical procedure volumes were approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels as we saw activity dip in July and ramp back up as we went through the quarter. Fourth quarter procedure volumes are currently projected to be 90% to 95% of pre-COVID levels as labor shortages continue to impact the pace of recovery. Oral care was down mid-single digits against low double-digit growth from a year ago. We are also seeing softening due to the ongoing inflationary pressures impacting consumer spending on discretionary oral care and orthodontic procedures. Healthcare\u2019s third quarter operating income was $452 million, down 11% year-on-year. Operating margins were 21.8%, down 1.7 percentage points with adjusted EBITDA margins of over 29%. Year-on-year operating margins were impacted by increased raw materials and logistics costs along with manufacturing productivity headwinds. These impacts were partially offset by price actions and spending discipline. The Healthcare business group is focused on delivering innovation, including investments in the launch of 3M Filtek Matrix, which creates a new and innovative approach for dental restorations, simplifying the procedure and enabling more natural tooth structure to remain. In addition, the team made capital investments to support manufacturing capacity expansion in the Separation and Purification, and Medical Solutions business. Lastly, our Consumer business posted third quarter sales of $1.4 billion or up 1.5% year-on-year on an organic basis versus last year\u2019s 8% comparison. Year-on-year growth in the third quarter was led by Consumer Health and Safety, which was up mid-single digits organically, and Stationery and Office and Home Care, which both grew low single digits. Home improvement growth was down low single digits organically versus last year\u2019s strong comparison, however, increased mid-teens sequentially. The back-to-school season was softer than expected as consumer spending continues to be impacted by ongoing inflationary pressures, along with retailers aggressively addressing elevated inventory levels. Looking ahead, we anticipate these impacts to continue throughout the upcoming holiday season. Consumer\u2019s third quarter operating income was $299 million, down 3% compared to last year with operating margins of 21.3%, down slightly year-on-year. Our Consumer business operating margins benefited from selling price actions, spending discipline and restructuring actions. These benefits were more than offset by increase in raw materials, logistics and outsourced hardgoods manufacturing costs and manufacturing productivity headwinds. The Consumer business group is executing for future growth, including expanding our Command platform to help consumers hang, organize and decorate in even more creative ways. Please turn to Slide 9 for a discussion on our 2022 outlook. The macro environment remains uncertain with mixed trends and signals across geographies and end markets. While we are working through these challenges and taking actions, we are updating our full year guidance, reflecting our year-to-date performance, increasing U.S. dollar trend along with the continued fluid environment. Our updated 2020 to full year outlook includes; organic growth in the range of 1.5% to 2% versus a prior range of 1.5% to 3.5%; adjusted earnings in the range of $10.10 to $10.35 versus a prior range of $10.30 to $10.80, which includes an additional headwind of $0.15 per share from foreign currency exchange compared to just three months ago; and adjusted free cash flow conversion to be in the range of 85% to 95% versus our prior range of 90% to 100%. Before I wrap up, let me make a few comments regarding the fourth quarter. First, from an end market perspective, GDP and IPI continue to moderate with current Q4 estimates of 1.4% and 2.2%, respectively. We are closely monitoring the geopolitical environment in Europe and the impact on energy inflation and end market demand. Auto build rates are currently estimated to be up 2% year-on-year, while consumer electronics demand is expected to remain soft. Healthcare elective procedure and oral care volumes are expected to be in the range of 90% to 95% of pre-COVID levels. And lastly, we anticipate continued inflationary impacts on consumer spending, along with the inventory reduction actions at retailers. Therefore, looking at the fourth quarter, we expect total sales to be in the range of $7.9 billion to $8.2 billion. This includes organic growth in the range of 1% to 3%, which includes a 2% headwind or $150 million to $200 million from the continued decline in disposable respirator demand, and the exit of Russia, which will create a year-on-year headwind of approximately 80 basis points or approximately $70 million. Excluding the impact from these two items, Q4 organic growth is estimated to be nearly 4% to 6%. Increasing U.S. dollar strength is anticipated to be a year-on-year headwind of approximately 7% of sales or roughly $600 million. The divestiture of Food Safety and deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies will result in a Q4 headwind of approximately $120 million to sales of 1.5%. Turning to raw materials and logistics costs, we anticipate a Q4 year-on-year headwind of approximately $100 million to $150 million, which we expect to be able to navigate and offset the price actions. Operating margins are expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. And finally, our outstanding share count is currently anticipated to be in the mid-550 million share range, taking into account the $16 million share count reduction that I mentioned earlier. Looking ahead to 2023, while we are in the early stages of working through our plan, we see some items impacting us this year that will continue into next year, while some challenges may ease. We expect the macroeconomic environment to continue to moderate, while geopolitical uncertainties persist, impacting energy costs and end market demand, particularly in Europe. We are also monitoring the impact of the strong U.S. dollar, along with evolving COVID-related impacts, including on government policy response, healthcare elective procedure volumes and disposable respirator demand. Looking at end markets, we expect the pace of secular industry trends to accelerate, particularly in automotive, electronics, safety, digitization and sustainability. Each of these markets have tremendous opportunities for long-term growth, as we continue to innovate and invest in these areas. Raw material, logistics and labor inflation are starting to show some signs of moderation, and we are starting to see some evidence of global supply chain stabilization. As Mike mentioned, we believe manufacturing and supply chain operations are our greatest opportunity to reduce costs and increase productivity to drive improvement in operating margin performance. While significant uncertainty is expected to remain, we are focused on serving customers and executing our operating framework and operating principles. We are prepared and will adjust as warranted, and take necessary self-help actions to deliver long-term value for all our stakeholders. And finally, we are also working on ensuring we execute well on our Healthcare spin to create two leading world-class companies. As always, there is more we can do and will do. To wrap up, I want to thank our customers and suppliers for their partnerships and the 3M employees for their hard work and dedication as they continue delivering for our customers. That concludes my remarks for the third quarter. With that, we will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. You may proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Hi. Good morning, Mike and Monish and Bruce. Thanks for taking my questions.\nMike Roman: Good morning.\nMonish Patolawala: Hi, Scott.\nBruce Jermeland: Good morning.\nScott Davis: You guys were pretty clear about the end market outlook and stuff. Can you just take a step backwards and walk around the world, just by region on where things are getting kind of better or worse or where are things coming in a little bit better or worse than expectations. And I guess the onus of the question is that some of the results we have seen so far have been a little bit better in Europe and China than expected that you guys noted some cautious comments there. But I will just stop there and let you guys give some color?\nMike Roman: Sure. Scott, maybe I will kind of walk around the regions to give you a little more color than my opening comments highlighted where we are growing in each region. Just start with the Americas, and as you look at it, we saw the strongest growth for us in automotive and areas like electrical markets and our electronics markets and materials solutions. We saw declines in Personal Safety. Monish highlighted the Separation and Purification coming off the comparison to the COVID demand in vaccines and therapeutics. And then we highlighted the softer consumer spending in oral care, both Orthodontics and chairside dentistry. Looking at EMEA, we saw it up slightly this quarter. It was slightly negative in Q2. So slightly up this quarter, strongest growth there in automotive, too. So you are seeing a trend, the strong Q3 for automotive globally. We saw declines in Personal Safety and oral care, coming off COVID for Personal Safety and some of the similar dynamics in oral care. APAC growth, again, led by automotive. Personal Safety was strong in APAC. We saw some strong strength in Industrial portfolios more broadly, something that we saw in the quarter in the Safety and Industrial business ex-Personal Safety had strong growth in the quarter -- organic growth. We saw the decline was in electronics in APAC. We also saw some impact from some of the declines in areas like Transportation Safety. And then in China, the big story was the recovery from the lockdowns in Q2 and then also the declines in display materials and broader electronics as you saw the declines in consumer electronics impacting that. We were -- we did see strength in Personal Safety. We saw strength in automotive. We saw strength in broader Industrial. So, kind of a similar story across the areas, a little different growth dynamics, but similar story. And we -- I would say, we finished the quarter with our Industrial business is showing some strength. We saw continued strength in automotive, the softening in consumer electronics. Those are some of those trends that played out across the world. And then electric procedures starting to see - seeing the same trend improving, but not back to pre-COVID levels in terms of elective procedures. So, again, trends that we are seeing across the different regions.\nScott Davis: Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. And then just to be clear, Mike, is price where you want it to be right now, are we kind of at a fairly balanced level or just cost and that\u2019s no longer a major issue?\nMike Roman: Yeah. Scott, I -- we talked about that as we have gone through the year. We said at the beginning of the year that we were confident price would help us offset inflation as we came through the year and that\u2019s been the case. So our pricing, as you know, it\u2019s one component of, our value in the marketplace. The other is managing the inflation that we have been seeing globally. And we have been, I think, managing that price against inflation well all year and we are well positioned as we go into the end of the year. \nScott Davis: Okay. Super helpful. Best of luck. Thank you, guys.\nMike Roman: Yeah. Thanks, Scott.\nMonish Patolawala: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin: Hi, guys. Good morning.\nMike Roman: Good morning.\nMonish Patolawala: Hi, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Hey. Just a question sort of longer term question for you guys. How are you guys thinking about inflation into 2023? And specifically, you guys no longer disclose pricing, but just trying to understand how are you thinking about the pricing mechanism at 3M? And how are you adapting to what\u2019s happening and do you think we are going to get into a less inflationary environment or from what you are seeing inflation is pretty sticky into next year? \nMonish Patolawala: Andrew, it\u2019s a great question. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are still early in looking at 2023. What we are seeing is a little moderation in inflation, but it\u2019s not been consistent and persistent. We are seeing inflation is pretty much still broad-based. In areas that we are seeing is logistics has seen some slowdown in the pace of inflation. However, if you look at intermediate finished goods, they are still pretty high and so specialty raw materials. So I would say if you just look at what inflation we had in the third quarter, it was $225 million. In the fourth quarter, we are seeing somewhere between $100 million to $150 million. So there\u2019s a little moderation. I think what time will tell is whether 2023, we are able to see sustained lower prices and I think that would be good for all. So that\u2019s one. To answer your question on pricing, as Mike mentioned in his remarks and mine and even the prior question, we take a very thoughtful approach to pricing. Nearly 70% of our pricing is -- our products are pretty much spec in products. So we take a very thoughtful approach. We look at it region by region. We look at it product by product. And I would say we will have to follow. We follow a very thoughtful approach. We will follow a very thoughtful approach in 2023 also, because no one has seen this historic level of inflation in the recent past. So depending on where that goes, we will play that self out in the market. But at the end of the day, as Mike mentioned, part of our pricing is not just driven by cost, it\u2019s also the value that we drive for our customers. \nAndrew Obin: And just a follow-up question. Sorry.\nMike Roman: No. Go ahead.\nMonish Patolawala: Okay.\nAndrew Obin: Oh, just a follow-up question, if you look at recent stimulus that has been passed in the U.S., a lot of investment in chipset, a lot of investment on semiconductor, a lot of talk about supply chain for semiconductors, particularly things like upstream like substrate, maybe moving closer to North America. Do you guys need to sort of redo your global electronics supply chain, given what\u2019s happening out there on the regulatory front and stimulus front and just voluntary moves in capacity globally? Thanks. \nMike Roman: Yeah. Andrew and we are watching it closely. The Inflation Reduction Act, The Chips Act. They are providing the incentives for manufacturers and others to make investments in other parts of the world, the U.S. -- in the U.S. versus other parts of the world. And I would say, we are assessing the impacts on our customers. You know our model, I mean, we are -- we build capabilities and sufficient resources close to customers around the world. It\u2019s a regional model and it gives us the ability to serve our customers in each region in the world that also helps us be in a position to adapt as supply chain moves and that\u2019s been true for electronics as it\u2019s moved around Asia, in particular. And with these incentives, we expect there will be some changes. We don\u2019t see a significant impact to our business in the near-term, but we do serve global customers in electronics and semiconductor and will adjust as they make changes.\nAndrew Obin: But nothing sort of definitive at this point yet. You are still waiting...\nMike Roman: It\u2019s early in the process. There are announcements, there are investments being made and we will stay close to those and we will make adjustments as we go. And if you look at the U.S. in particular, just as a reminder, we are a net exporter out of the U.S. We export $5 billion out of the U.S. So it is a place where we have got a strong manufacturing position and that puts us in a position to adjust as capacity gets invested here. \nAndrew Obin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nMike Roman: Hi, Joe.\nMonish Patolawala: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: So I saw that we kept your inflation numbers intact for the year. I am just curious, like, are you starting to see any of your costs like start to subside at all and then if you can maybe start to give us a little bit of color on what you are seeing from a manufacturing perspective and energy costs in Europe and how that\u2019s impacting your business?\nMonish Patolawala: Yeah. So, Joe, I would tell you, we are seeing some moderation, as we saw inflation was $225 million in Q3, we are accounting for $100 million to $150 million in Q4. The total at $750 to $850 million has not changed. We are seeing -- inflation, I would say, is still generally broad-based. We are seeing higher inflation in specialty materials, as well as intermediate finished goods. We are seeing a little bit of moderation in logistics. So that\u2019s where we are on inflation. And then on supply chain, I would say, we are also seeing some signs of stabilization, Joe. We are seeing raw material flowing a little better than it has flown in the prior quarters and you can see that\u2019s why the team was also able to deliver decent productivity in Q3. We will have to watch and see whether, one, is the moderation in pricing or raw materials sustained, and secondly, is the flow of material sustained into Q4 and that\u2019s going to determine where we go. And as Mike has said, too, once we see the stabilization of supply chains and moderation of raw materials, we believe that is the best opportunity. We have other than volume to keep driving productivity in our factories and through that margin expansion. \nJoe Ritchie: Got it. That\u2019s helpful, Monish. And then I guess my follow-on question would be, obviously, a lot of uncertainty in the market right now as we are heading into 2023. Just maybe talk us through a little bit your recession playbook, how you are preparing yourself for what could be a pretty uncertain year, just any color around that would be helpful?\nMike Roman: Sure, Joe. And our model -- our operating model has been strong and shown resiliency in many economic cycles. And it\u2019s been clear throughout COVID, and I would say, the concern -- the current uncertainty in the markets that we are facing and so we will continue to do what we do in those cycles that helps us react to them well and position our performance well and that\u2019s focused on serving our customers, driving productivity, efficiency in our supply chains and our factories and delivering strong cash flow and it keeps us focused on the right actions. And we will stay focused on our end markets, too, where as we have talked about, there\u2019s some different dynamics in each of the end markets, even as we look at the softening global outlook for macro. And so we are prepared to adjust and take actions. That\u2019s our model and it will serve us well as we navigate the uncertainty ahead.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. Thank you, both.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. You may proceed with your question.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. So I wanted to first ask on the Q4 guide, which puts organic growth largely in line with Q3 levels at the midpoint or exactly at the midpoint despite a slightly larger respirator headwind. Could you just provide some incremental color at the -- for the puts and takes at the segment level as we look into Q4?\nMonish Patolawala: Yeah. Sure, Chris. As -- I will just start with recapping again Q4. We will just start by saying, last year\u2019s fourth quarter was our easiest guide or easiest comparison. Number two is, you are right, so disposable respirators is going to be down and that creates a headwind of nearly 180 basis points, and then the exit of Russia is another $70 million, which gives another 80 basis points of pressure. So if you exclude all of that, you would get to a 4% to 6% increase in organic growth on a year-over-year basis. If you look at where the macro is going to be GDP and IPI is in that 2%-ish range for the fourth quarter, auto is going to be up 2% sequentially or nearly 2.5% depending on IHS forecast, approximately 2% up on a year-over-year basis. Elective procedures, which were at 90% in July and moved itself up a little bit in August and September, we believe, will move up a little bit to 90% to 95%, so you will see that uplift. I would say consumer spending continues to be weak. Even in the month of October, we have seen lower consumer spending. I called that out as those trends where the inflation is impacting the consumer, I think, remains through the holiday season, as well as how inventory levels are adjusted by retailers is something that we will have to watch. Consumer electronics continues to be down on a year-over-year basis, a little moderation on improvement on a sequential basis. But again, there, we will have to see where that plays itself out between consumer electronics, as well as then you talk about semiconductor growth continues to be strong. We are continuing to see that in our business on the other side of the electronics business. And then from an Industrial perspective, we have already talked about disposable respirator but the rest of the end market remains pretty strong in SIBG.\nChris Snyder: Thank you for that. Really helpful. And then the second one just on margins, if we kind of look from Q3, margins were up versus Q2 on slightly lower topline. Is it fair to assume that reflects improving price cost or was there some margin impacts from the portfolio changes during the quarter? And if it does reflect improving price cost, I mean, is the expectation that, that should continue to improve from here even if the cost relief might be a little bit down the road?\nMonish Patolawala: Yeah. So, Chris, I would say it\u2019s all. As we look at it and the team has been doing a great job at driving margin expansion. And in Q3, you have seen -- as you said, we continue to see the price cost equation. We have offset or managed our inflation through pricing actions. We have had better yield and efficiency also compared to the second quarter as we saw some stabilization of supply chains. Third, as I called out, we have also the team had a lot of strong spending discipline. We took a lot of self-help measures. We proactively adjusted where we saw end market change, et cetera. So put all that together, we did see 50 basis points of margin expansion. When you think about Q4, if you know that in Q3 we did $8.6 billion in Q4, we are saying $7.9 million to $8.2 million, which is the volume basically gives us the best leverage. So that\u2019s why you do see margin come down. And historically, if you look at 3M also Q3 to Q4, always shows a decline because it is a lower volume quarter for 3M. To answer your question on what happens in the long-term, I would say, Chris, the same as I have said in my prepared remarks, which is there are headwinds that we see, whether it\u2019s macroeconomic environment, FX, the impact of energy cost on, especially in Europe and the geopolitical environment are all headwinds. Similarly, we will have to watch what happens with COVID-related demand, whether it is government policy, whether it is elective procedures or whether it is our own disposable respirator demand. But there are a lot of tailwinds too. We see secular trends that will continue to go up in areas that we add a lot of value to customers, whether it\u2019s auto electrification, sustainability, digitization, just to name a few. Also, when we -- as we see raw materials starting to stabilize a moderate and supply chain starting to stabilize or moderate, we should get a lot more opportunity to drive yield and efficiency, and that\u2019s what Mike said in his prepared remarks, too, that that\u2019s -- other than volume, that\u2019s one of our biggest opportunities to continue to drive margin. So hopefully that answers your question, Chris.\nChris Snyder: It does. Thank you. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. You may proceed with your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Hey. Good morning, everyone.\nMonish Patolawala: Good morning, Andrew.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Mike or Monish, maybe just a little more color into Healthcare, I know you have talked about sales growth being a little lower in Q3, oral care turned down a little bit. It seems like the elective procedures have been stuck a little bit and you talked about them improving in Q4, but the issue just sort of staffing shortage in hospitals. What are you seeing in China over there and how concerned are you about oral care given it does tend to be a little more sensitive to the economy?\nMonish Patolawala: Yeah. Andy, there -- you are right. There\u2019s some different dynamics going on than Q2. When you look at elective procedures and oral care versus surgical procedures or medical procedures, it kind of -- I think, in general, it\u2019s on track with what we had said at the beginning of the year that it would get back to around 95% by the end of the year, 95% to 100%, maybe we are slightly below that now. And I think that\u2019s a reflection of what was part of your question. That\u2019s the staffing levels right now. It\u2019s been a bigger impact than obviously COVID hospitalizations have been in the current quarter and then outlook for the rest of the year. So I think that\u2019s holding it back maybe keeping it from being quite at the level that we thought it would be when we started the year. Oral care, we saw strong recovery in procedures there in 2021 and that\u2019s part of the comp that we are looking at year-over-year. The impact this year appears to be consumer discretionary spending. They are electing to spend less in some of those elective procedures in oral care. So that\u2019s had a softening impact and we see those trends continue as we came out of Q3. So I -- a little bit different than maybe where we saw at the beginning of the year, but it\u2019s, generally, we are looking for improvements as we go into Q4 in those medical electric procedures. \nMike Roman: I would also just add that the other piece was Biopharma, which had a very strong quarter last year, and we are seeing on a year-on-year lower demand, just driven by the COVID therapeutics that we sold into last year. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Very helpful guys. And then, Monish, maybe you can update us on your work on digitization and I think you have talked in the past about data analytics really helping you in the second half of the year here and especially in 2023. It seems like today, you are talking about you having cost out opportunity. You noticed your Safety and Industrial business margin was up nicely sequentially. So how much of an impact is that coming from digitization or is this that just sort of general execution?\nMonish Patolawala: So I would just say the following, Andy, is, as I said in February at our Investor Day, digital can be a multiplier for 3M. And it will take time. We have four pillars. One is digital customer. The other one is digital product. The third one is digital operations. And then the last one is just digital enterprise or enterprise digital. I think the last one is ERP that helps us simplify our business. Digital operation is the place where you are talking about is from a factory perspective. The team has done a lot of work using data and data analytics to improve yield and efficiency in the factories. For example, we were able to create a digital twin for our respirator production during the pandemic, which the team is continuing to use and those models are being used for other parts of our production lines. There\u2019s a lot more we can do in this area in automation and digitization to drive yield and efficiency and especially as supply chains start normalizing. This is an area where we should be able to dig faster into root cause and put into solutions. Similarly, data and data analytics helps us in inventory a lot too, Andy. And despite all the inefficiency that exists currently in the supply chain, the teams have done a nice job of continuing to improve inventory. August to September saw a sequential decline in inventory and so that\u2019s another sign that the teams are looking at data. It allows them actually to visually see where their inventory is so it allows better demand planning. And then if you actually go to digital product and digital customer, both of them, e-commerce continues to be an important area for us of growth. In Safety and -- in the Safety and Industrial business, we bought the assets of a company called LeanTec that allows us to do software for auto body shops, so parts management through software for auto body shops. So that\u2019s starting to take hold and Mike Wale and his team have done a nice job there. And Mike Roman mentioned in his opening remarks, the collaboration we have with Microsoft, where we announced the digital posted note in collaboration with Microsoft. So you are seeing digital play itself out in multiple places. I would say there\u2019s a lot more opportunity for us in the future in this area.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Appreciate it guys.\nMonish Patolawala: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan Securities. You may proceed with your question.\nStephen Tusa: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nMonish Patolawala: Good morning, Steve.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Steve.\nStephen Tusa: Can you just give some degree of color on whether you were, like, you don\u2019t have to give details on the price, but like just with the spread positive, neutral, negative this quarter and how do you\u2026\nMonish Patolawala: Positive\u2026\nStephen Tusa: \u2026 expect that in fourth quarter, it was positive this quarter?\nMonish Patolawala: That\u2019s right. And\u2026\nStephen Tusa: Did that accelerate -- and did that accelerate from last quarter?\nMonish Patolawala: To the extent where we saw more in areas where we saw more inflation, we were able to offset that with more price. So, overall, I would say, mid-single digits is where we were, Steve, on pricing.\nStephen Tusa: Okay. Got it. That\u2019s great color. And then you guys kind of tweaked down the CapEx number a little bit. I know that number has been kind of growing over the last several years. Are you now kind of cresting on these major projects, and you mentioned, digitization and automation in your -- with the prior question, but how do we think about that heading into 2023, that CapEx number?\nMonish Patolawala: Yeah. So, as I said, we are still early planning 2023. But in this case, the guide down, Steve, was just because of where we are with the length of supply chains. We have seen supply chain backlog or the cycle time of these go up anywhere from 12 weeks to 20 weeks depending on the CapEx equipment that we are buying. And so just based on where we are in the quarter, we thought it was prudent to take it down to $175 million to $185 million. But all good projects and the projects that are falling into next year will continue to get completed because they are great projects. I just wish we would have got them done this year, unfortunately, the supply chain just didn\u2019t help us.\nStephen Tusa: Yeah. Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the color.\nMonish Patolawala: Thanks.\nMike Roman: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks. Good morning. And maybe just the first question around the inventories outlook. So you took down your cash flow conversion guide for the year, even with the CapEx reduction you just discussed. I think also, Monish, you had mentioned inventory is down sort of month-on-month in September. So help us understand kind of where do you think customer inventories and distributor inventories sit right now versus normal and how much kind of destocking lies ahead for your customers and for 3M itself? How quickly should we see that cash flow conversion get back to 100%? Is it sort of late next year or you think next year as a whole, you could be there already?\nMike Roman: Yeah. Julian, maybe I will just touch on how we see inventory in the channel and with our customers and it\u2019s maybe just a quick walk around the different business segments. Industrial channel inventories, they look like they are in pretty good shape. We saw, as you saw strong broad-based growth and so well aligned with that. Consumer electronics, the OEMs are working through some inventories as the demand weakens. I think automotive inventories continue to be still relatively low with the demand that they are seeing. Our Healthcare, overall, in line with the demand. We saw some softening, obviously, in oral care and the channels reacting there. So we are seeing some inventory pulled on. The big story and inventory probably is what you have heard from many other companies, the retailers working through their elevated inventory levels and navigating the kind of the shift in consumer spending and the impact there. We are seeing that as we come out of Q3. So that\u2019s kind of the external view. Maybe Monish can talk about kind of how we map it internally.\nMonish Patolawala: Yeah. Sure. So, Julian, it\u2019s back to the same comments we made that the global supply chain and raw material environment continues to remain fluid and dynamic. And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the inventory level, even though we did take it down August through September, that\u2019s a start. One, we need to see the supply chain stabilize sustainably. And two is, when you look at where we are at the end of Q3, we don\u2019t see those inventory levels coming down to the level we would have liked in a stable environment and that\u2019s why we felt prudent to get it down to 85% to 95%. The team is continuing to work inventory using data, data analytics, get a better demand planning. At the same time, we also look at better coordination between our demand plans and our supply plans and that\u2019s what the teams are working on. And I think we will continue doing that in the long run. I would say in the long run, there\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t be at 100% free cash flow conversion, when you look at the cash flow that we generate and the opportunity that we have to continue to drive inventory down using data and data analytics.\nJulian Mitchell: Thank you very much. And then just my follow-up would be around, you mentioned earlier some self-help measures, digitization and better data tracking, just wondered in terms of kind of overall operating margins. I think 3M as a whole has been at that sort of 21%, 22% range for four years or five years now. It\u2019s been a couple of years since the last big kind of restructuring announcement in December 2020. Just wondering what the appetite was for maybe another round of that kind of big fixed cost out, particularly as the macro is a little bit softer or are you feeling pretty confident about operating leverage next year?\nMike Roman: Yeah. Julian, as I talked about earlier, we are confident in our ability to respond to the changes in the macro and we are always adjusting our businesses to meet the markets and whether it\u2019s near-term or in the future. And so we are going to continue to focus on productivity. That\u2019s a big part of the self-help for us, leveraging some of the capabilities Monish talked about to drive that as supply chains improve and recover, we expect to be able to drive more self-help. And we will continue to stay close to the end markets and the macro and take actions as is needed. We don\u2019t have a big plan to announce today, but we -- our model is to adjust to markets as we go.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning and thanks again\u2026\nMike Roman: Good morning, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Yeah. Hi, guys. So just going back to the exports, I think, you mentioned, Monish, $5 billion, if I am not mistaken. Just wondering, do you exports from the U.S. over indexed to a certain region? I think Latin America might be one, I think, maybe China as well, but any thoughts there in terms of concentrations of markets you are important to? And then in terms of the currency effects, the translation -- the transactional effect of that, are you able to kind of talk through to offset the FX impact?\nMonish Patolawala: Yeah. Nigel, just to break down the exports a little bit, it\u2019s net exporting, it\u2019s really based on the capabilities that we have invested in the U.S. And it does serve all of those markets, Europe, Latin America, Asia, China, and so we are -- I wouldn\u2019t say we are over-indexed anywhere. It\u2019s really a strategy of portfolio and where we produce. And while we are regionally capable for our businesses everywhere around the world, a majority of what we sell in each region of the world, we produce in region, there are some parts of our portfolio that we don\u2019t need to have capacity in order to we have the demand for every region, and so we will export out of the U.S. and that -- there is a balance around the world. You will see some over indexing in the electronics manufacturing to Asia and China, of course. But more broadly, it\u2019s balanced across the regions of the world.\nNigel Coe: And the pricing, are you able to offset the currency effect?\nMonish Patolawala: Yeah. So, Nigel, the way most of these work is they go into intermediate into the production of another factory that\u2019s locally manufacturing the product. So you will see that cost increase. The team takes all of that into account when they get their pricing, they factor in the raw material, they factor in FX and then do what they can in that area to offset it. In total, as we have talked about, currently, we see effects of the strong dollar to continue to have a headwind on 2022 earnings, negative 4.5% on revenue and it\u2019s nearly $0.50 on EPS for the year. So we do our best to try to manage it. At the end of the day, we can\u2019t eliminate such a strong dollar and we will see how it plays out in 2023.\nNigel Coe: All right. I will leave it there. Thank you very much.\nMonish Patolawala: Thanks.\nMike Roman: Thanks, Nigel.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Deane.\nMonish Patolawala: Hi, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Hey, Mike. I was hoping you could comment or expand your comments on what you have seen in October, especially on the consumer side, you said softer back-to-school setting up for softer holiday. I\u2019d also be interested in hearing, if you see changes in the consumer purchasing in the mix, like more focused on lower price point products and might you lose any share in this mix down? \nMike Roman: Yeah. Deane, as we exited Q3, as I touched on, we saw what others are seeing. The retailers are working through elevated inventories. That was a trend we saw impacting. We saw the -- as Monish talked about a softer back-to-school, which was maybe a separate market dynamic. There\u2019s been a shift in consumer spending from what we call hard lines. So where our products are in the categories that they are in, in retail markets and that into other areas like food, for example. And so you are seeing some shifting in consumer spending. That\u2019s part of the trend that we saw coming through Q3 and we see as we come out of the quarter into the rest of the year. And I would say the inflation continues to be driving some of those trends. So that\u2019s really at a high level, that\u2019s what we are watching closely. We are close with our retail partners and watching each of the categories and consumer spending as we see those trends evolve. \nDeane Dray: Any share change?\nMike Roman: No. We -- I think the dynamics that you are seeing in our organic growth in consumer is really about the consumer spending and the end markets. It\u2019s not about share change. We see our maintaining share and in some places gaining share. We see some of the positions that we -- where we have invested coming out of the pandemic and areas in consumer like our home improvement, even though it\u2019s -- we saw some softening demands in home improvement in the U.S. in the third quarter, we see we are well positioned to continue to have strong share in that part of the market.\nDeane Dray: Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.\nMike Roman: To wrap up, we continue to execute our strategies in a challenging environment, while positioning 3M for the future through investments in growth, productivity and sustainability, along with active portfolio management. We will stay focused on taking care of our customers, driving growth and improving our operational performance. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the 3M Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, July 26, 2022. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland: Thank you and good morning, everyone and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial and Transformation Officer; and Kevin Rhodes, our Chief Legal Affairs Officer. Please note, that Mike's and Monish's formal comments this morning will be longer than past quarters given the announcements that we made this morning. Therefore, when we get to Q&A, please keep it to one question and 1 follow-up so that we can try and get to everyone as efficiently as possible. Also note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Please turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we will be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K and 8-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note throughout today's presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to these slides and in the attachments to today's press release. With that, please turn to Slide 3, and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike?\nMike Roman: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today is an exciting and important day for 3M. We are positioning our company for future success by creating more opportunity while reducing uncertainty. We plan to spin off our healthcare business, which will result in two world-class public companies that are global leaders with significant growth opportunities in the respective markets. We intend to execute a tax free spin-off creating a global diversified healthcare technology leader. New 3M will remain a leading global material science innovator, serving customers across a range of diverse and attractive end markets. Each company will be well capitalized, more agile and focused and well positioned for long-term success. Also, we are proactively taking steps to resolve litigation related to Combat Arms earplugs. Aero Technologies, a 3M subsidiary has voluntarily elected to initiate Chapter 11 proceedings. This process is intended to resolve claims related to Combat Arms in a manner that is efficient and equitable. 3M has not filed for Chapter 11. Both 3M and Aero expect to continue to operate in the ordinary course. And as we announced earlier in our earnings press release, 3M continues to deliver in a challenging environment with adjusted earnings per share of $2.48 in the second quarter. We also posted organic growth of nearly 5%, excluding the impact of disposable respirators and COVID-related lockdowns in China. Monish will cover our Q2 results in detail after my remarks. Please turn to slide four. Now, is the right time for 3M to act as we position our company to win in a rapidly changing world. As I shared at our investor meeting in February, disciplined portfolio management is foundational to our growth strategy. Our Board and management team actively evaluate strategic options to drive long-term sustainable growth. The importance of portfolio management has never been greater, especially given the extraordinary macroeconomic changes brought about at the pandemic. I'll speak to Healthcare in a moment, but let me first talk about the strong businesses that will make up new 3M. Our market-leading business groups are aligned to highly attractive end markets with tremendous opportunities in front of them. Each of these business groups grew above 8% in 2021 and are delivering solid results in a challenging environment this year. Together, these businesses make up an outstanding portfolio that actively leverages our world-class capabilities. As global megatrends have accelerated, many of those trends demand our customer-driven innovations that aligned our growth priorities. Areas such as electronics, safety, mobility, digitization, home improvement, and sustainability, all represent significant opportunities for 3M. An important example of our strategic portfolio management is the progress we have made in health care. Through organic investments in innovation, strategic M&A and updates to our operating model, we have positioned Healthcare to be successful as a stand-alone enterprise. In 2019, we acquired Acelity and M*Modal, establishing our leadership in Advanced Wound Care and in Health Information Systems. Also, we have divested drug delivery and are in the process of separating our food safety business. Our business group-led operating model, which we implemented in 2020 has also enabled our businesses and R&D to be closer to our customers. These actions, in addition to Healthcare's strong capabilities are why we feel now is the right time to formally operate as a stand-alone healthcare leader, especially given important trends that favor our business. With shifting demographics, growing demand for virtual and in-home care, a focus on reducing rehospitalizations, advances in healthcare IT systems, and a growing focus on delivering better patient care at a lower cost, our Healthcare business is at the intersection of data, analytics, and technologies needed to deliver precision medicine. Both companies will sharpen their focus to continue investing and winning in global end markets and have greater flexibility to strategically deploy capital, drive innovation, and accelerate growth. Turning now to slide five. Our actions will drive long-term value for our shareholders. New 3M and Healthcare will tailor their capital allocation and investments to drive innovation and growth. As leaders in their markets, their enhanced focus will help position each to respond even faster to shifting industry dynamics and needs. They will both offer distinct and compelling investment profiles appealing to different investor bases. These actions will help unlock and unleash value for 3M and the Healthcare business and chart an exciting course for our future. At the same time, we are also working to reduce uncertainty by efficiently and equitably resolving Combat Arms Earplug Litigation. I will now provide more detail about our planned spin-off of our Healthcare business and the opportunities this will create. Please turn to slide seven. Each business will be financially strong leaders in their respective industries. 3M will be an approximately $26.8 billion business and remain a leading provider of innovative solutions for a broad diverse range of end markets, including industrial, safety, automotive, electronics and consumer. Each of these businesses benefit from 3M science and innovation. Our Healthcare business drove $8.6 billion in sales in 2021, which includes approximately $400 million in revenue from our food safety business. We intend to complete the previously announced separation of the food safety business through a split-off transaction with a targeted closing date of September 1, 2022, subject to approval by Neogen shareholders, in addition to other customary closing conditions. Our go-forward healthcare business will build upon strong positions in attractive markets, including wound care, oral care, healthcare IT and biopharma filtration. Next slide, please. With our fundamental strengths in science and technology, manufacturing, global capabilities and iconic brands, we are well positioned to capitalize on and invest in key megatrends. A hallmark of 3M is our ability to leverage unique and differentiated technologies across our organization, allowing us to create new solutions required by a world where we are seeing accelerated demand for innovation and sustainability. We will continue to actively manage our portfolio with discipline and focus, generate strong margins and cash flow and grow earnings by improving operating rigor. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. These include investing in organic growth, an attractive dividend, strategic M&A and finally, share repurchases. Next slide, please. As we look ahead, innovation, talent and operations will remain core strengths for new 3M. We will drive more customer-focused innovation leverage data and insights from our retail partners and connect with customers through advanced e-commerce strategies. We will share technology platforms and leverage R&D across the enterprise, which will help drive growth in all of our businesses.  Attracting and retaining talented people are top priorities. We will connect them through greater flexibility with our Work Your Way model and continuously strengthen our culture of innovation. We will also advance our capabilities through digitization to provide unique solutions and achieve greater end-to-end performance across our global operations.  Our innovative manufacturing expertise will continue to be a differentiator and to ensure greater connectivity to customers, we will enhance our service and streamline our operating model. We are equally excited for the future of our Healthcare business, which I will explain on Slide 10.  Our Healthcare business enables better, smarter and safer care and we'll be well positioned to support customer needs and make the most of attractive opportunities, including a growing focus on infection prevention to help providers reduce related rehospitalizations, hospitals increasing investments and improvements in clinical and operational workflows to drive efficiencies and improve patient experiences, more frequent use of biologics as a first-line choice of treatment. In addition, medicines are becoming more complex and advanced, requiring specialized, tailored solutions. And the combination of material science and digital science, especially within oral care, is changing the patient experience for the better. With our deep and diverse portfolio of trusted brands, global capabilities, regulatory expertise and leading positions in attractive segments, we expect the health care business to generate strong recurring revenues, margins and cash flow. Next slide, please. We are excited about the health care business we have built, with intention and a clear focus on helping improve the health of people around the world. Our business is powered by core strengths, including our proven leadership in multiple care pathways, our position in attractive end markets, an innovation mindset, customer relationships, regulatory expertise and operational excellence. These strengths enable strong sales growth and profitability and importantly, deliver better patient care. Next slide, please. We are well positioned in large and growing health care end markets, which are expected to grow at a strong and steady rate over the next several years. Our wound care business is a world leader and comprises a portfolio of innovative products. Our oral care business is another leading platform, which has developed award-winning innovations. Health care information systems are increasingly essential, as providers seek to deliver better care through comprehensive data and insights. Our biopharma filtration products are critical to manufacturing potentially life-saving medical devices, vaccines, drugs and therapeutics. Now let me turn to some of the specifics of the transaction on the next slide. 3M plans to pursue a tax-free spin-off and retain a 19.9% stake, which we expect to monetize over time. We expect health care will be spun off with net leverage of 3 to 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA and will delever rapidly, given the business' strong cash flow. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, we anticipate completing this transaction by the end of 2023, and we anticipate no change in 3M's capital allocation priorities through separation. In addition, 3M will retain responsibility for non-health care-related litigation, including Combat Arms Earplugs and PFAS. Over the next several months, we will begin our work to stand up these two companies, and we'll share updates as we progress. Now let me provide some additional background on Combat Arms litigation. Please turn to slide 15. To provide some context, in 2008, 3M acquired Aearo Technologies, which manufactured Combat Arms Earplugs. Since the acquisition, Aearo has continued to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of 3M. These products provided effective hearing protection when used properly, and we stand by their performance. The US military continues to rely on 3M products, including newer versions of the Combat Arms Earplugs. Nonetheless, there has been an extraordinary increase in litigation related to Combat Arms. As of June 30, 2022, there were approximately 115,000 filed claims and an additional 120,000 claims on an administrative docket. The multi-district litigation process and the highly variable outcomes it has generated has not provided certainty or clarity. We believe that litigating these cases individually could take years, if not decades. We want to do right by veterans and all stakeholders, and we expect the steps we are taking today will provide greater certainty as we take action to efficiently and equitably resolve claims related to Combat Arms. We have made the decision to adopt a new legal strategy. So let me provide a little more context on the actions we are taking. Aearo has voluntarily elected to use well-established Chapter 11 procedures to resolve this litigation. Aearo will indemnify 3M for all liabilities related to Combat Arms and certain discontinued Aearo respirator mask products. 3M has entered into a funding agreement and has committed to fund a trust of $1 billion to resolve all claims determined to be entitled to compensation. This amount is based on the analysis of an experienced estimator of claims in Chapter 11. In addition, we are committing $240 million to cover projected case related expenses. 3M will provide additional funding if required under the terms of the agreement. By taking these actions, we expect to provide greater certainty and clarity and help funds go to plaintiffs with claims that are determined to be entitled to compensation sooner. This will help reduce the cost and time that could otherwise be required to litigate thousands of cases. Let me now say a few words about our plans to manage PFAS. 3M stands by our record of environmental stewardship. We are already deploying state-of-the-art technology that will help us achieve our goal of a 99% reduction in PFAS discharges from our operations. We are making progress against our goals of improving water quality, reducing water use, reducing plastic use and achieving carbon neutrality. In addition, we continue to remediate at sites where 3M historically manufactured or disposed of PFOA and PFOS. Now specifically to PFAS related litigation. We plan to vigorously defend ourselves. We are preparing our defense for upcoming milestones in the litigation process, and we are well-advised of our options. Next slide. We are excited about the future of 3M. Our actions today will provide greater focus for our organization. Before I turn it over to Monish, I want to reiterate a few key takeaways. Our investments in innovation, our portfolio management strategy our realigned operating model will power our future growth. We will have dedicated teams to help facilitate focused execution of our actions announced today. Our planned tax-free spin-off will result in a leading global diversified health care technology company. We will create more opportunity for both 3M and the newly stand-alone health care business through this transaction, with two public companies well-positioned to drive future success. In addition, we are taking action to efficiently and equitably resolve Combat Arms litigation. Finally, we remain focused on delivering in a challenging environment. Now I will turn it to Monish to provide an update on our Q2 performance and an updated outlook for the year. Monish?\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to slide 17. The 3M team executed well and delivered solid Q2 results by remaining focused on serving our customers, while navigating continued supply chain challenges, inflationary pressures along with the geopolitical and COVID dynamics. Second quarter total sales were $8.7 billion, which increased 1% on an organic basis versus last year's 21% comparison. Adjusted operating income was $1.8 billion, with adjusted operating margins of 21% and adjusted earnings per share of $2.48. We continue to experience strong demand across most end markets. However, a couple of items had a negative impact on overall Q2 results which we had highlighted during the quarter. First, as forecasted, we experienced a year-on-year decline in disposable respirator sales of approximately $150 million; and second, the Greater China region's COVID-related lockdowns resulted in a sales decline of approximately $140 million year-on-year. The impact was lower than the $300 million headwind we had anticipated as the reopening of our facilities in June went better than anticipated. Our China team did a tremendous job adding additional shifts to ramp up production, distribution, and drive productivity to serve our customers. Adjusting for these two impacts, organic revenue growth was nearly 5% for the rest of 3M in the quarter. Also, the continued strengthening of the US dollar resulted in a foreign currency translation impact of minus four percentage points to Q2 total sales growth. This FX impact, combined with the China COVID-related lockdown, negatively impacted second quarter operating margins by nearly one percentage point and earnings by $0.24 per share versus our expectation of $0.30 as discussed during a conference in early June. We also continue to support our people and manage the business and supply chain impacts from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. We also announced additional investments to resolve matters related to our operations in Zwijndrecht and began the process of restarting manufacturing operations, which is progressing to plan. And finally, as I will expand upon later, we are updating our full year expectations, primarily to incorporate the impact of the strong US dollar, along with macroeconomic uncertainty. Please turn to slide 18, where I'll get into more details of the quarter. On this slide, you can see the components that impacted our operating margins and earnings per share performance as compared to Q2 last year. First, we continue to benefit from selling price actions, restructuring savings, and strong spending discipline, which helped drive an improvement to underlying margins of 2.9 percentage points or $0.44 to earnings per share year-on-year. These actions helped to more than offset headwinds, including the forecasted decline in disposable respirator demand, which negatively impacted Q2 operating margins by 40 basis points and earnings by $0.09 a share. The previously mentioned China COVID-related lockdown, which resulted in a year-on-year headwind of 70 basis points to operating margins and $0.11 to earnings per share. And finally, as discussed during last year's second quarter earnings call, we realized a benefit to both operating margins and earnings in Q2 last year from a Brazilian Supreme Court social tax ruling, which led to a 100 basis point margin and $0.12 per share headwind to this year's second quarter. We also continue to prioritize investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability to drive long-term performance and capitalize on trends in large attractive markets, including automotive, safety, healthcare, electronics, software, and home improvement. Moving on to raw materials and logistics. Inflationary pressures resulted in a year-on-year headwind of nearly $270 million in the quarter or a negative impact of 3.1 percentage points to operating margins and $0.36 to earnings. Halfway through 2022, we have experienced approximately $480 million of raw materials and logistics headwinds versus our original full year expectation of $350 million to $450 million at the start of the year. We now anticipate this year full year headwind to be in the range of $750 million to $850 million, which we continue to expect to offset through pricing actions. As I mentioned earlier, foreign currency translation was a negative 4 percentage point impact or a reduction of nearly $340 million in total sales and over $80 million in operating income net of hedging year-on-year. This resulted in a headwind of 10 basis points to margins and to $0.13 to earnings per share. Other financial items increased earnings by a net $0.10 per share year-on-year, driven by benefits from a lower share count and tax rate. Please turn to Slide 19. Second quarter adjusted free cash flow was $1 billion with conversion of 68%. Our year-on-year conversion performance was a result of a higher-than-expected increase in working capital, along with the cash impact from capitalization of R&D for US tax purposes. Working capital improvement is a big piece of how we keep generating good strong cash flow for 3M. The global supply chain and logistics environments remain challenging. The data analytics platform that we have created will help us to reduce inventory levels through better demand planning SKU rationalization and use of visualization tools. We expect the benefits of these efforts to start showing up in the second half and years to come. Capital expenditure was $384 million in the quarter and $808 million year-to-date or up 15% year-on-year as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. For the full year, we continue to anticipate CapEx investments in the range of $1.7 billion to $2 billion. During the quarter, we returned $848 million to shareholders through cash dividends. As we have communicated previously, share repurchases remained suspended in Q2 due to the pending food safety separation. We intend to complete the separation through a split-off with the closing date of September 1, subject to Neogen shareholder approval and other customary closing conditions. Net debt stands at $13.3 billion, up approximately 4% as we continue to invest in the business. Please turn to Slide 21 for our business group performance for Q2. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.9 billion or up 0.7% organically compared to last year's second quarter. This result included headwinds from the decline in disposable respirator sales of approximately $150 million year-on-year, which negatively impacted Safety and Industrial's organic growth by 5.7 percentage points, along with the COVID-related lockdowns in the Greater China region. Our personal safety business declined high single-digits organically, primarily due to the decline in COVID-related disposable respirator demand. We continue to anticipate that COVID-related disposable respirator demand will decline as we move through 2022. However, we remain prepared to respond to changes in demand as appropriate.  Turning to the rest of Safety and Industrial. Abrasives, electrical markets and closure and masking businesses all grew low double digits organically. Roofing granules, automotive aftermarket and industrial adhesives and tapes, all delivered low single-digit organic growth. Safety and Industrial's second quarter adjusted operating income was $630 million, down 12% versus last year.  Adjusted operating margins were 21.5%, down 2.1 percentage points. Adjusted operating margins were impacted by China lockdowns and manufacturing productivity headwinds, which were partially offset by spending discipline and benefits from restructuring actions.  Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which posted sales of $2.3 billion, up 0.5% organically compared to last year. Organic growth was held back by the lockdowns in China, along with the ongoing impacts of the semiconductor supply chain constraints on the automotive and consumer electronics end markets.  Organic sales in our auto OEM business were up low single digits versus flat global car and light truck builds as we continue to gain penetration on automotive platforms. Our electronics-related business declined low single digits organically with decreases across consumer electronics, particularly smartphones, tablets and TVs. These declines were partially offset by continued strong demand for our solutions in semiconductor, factory automation and automotive end markets. Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Advanced Materials and Commercial Solutions grew organically mid-single digits, while transportation safety was down high single digits. Second quarter operating income was $476 million, down 7% year-on-year.  Operating margins were 21%, down 80 basis points year-on-year. Operating margins were impacted by manufacturing productivity headwinds due to China's lockdowns and the continued shutdown during Q2 of certain operations in our Zwijndrecht factory. These impacts were partially offset by the strong spending discipline and benefits from restructuring.  Looking at our Healthcare business, which delivered strong quarter sales of $2.2 billion, with organic growth of 4.4%. Our medical solutions and oral care businesses increased low single digits organically. Second quarter US elective medical procedures and oral care volumes were approximately 90% to 95% of pre-COVID levels, up sequentially from Q1 levels.  Health Information Systems grew mid-single digits, driven by strong growth in revenue cycle management. The separation and purification business increased high single digits with sustained demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccines.  And finally, food safety was flat year-on-year. Healthcare second quarter operating income was $494 million, down 10% year-on-year. Operating margins were 22.7%, down 2.6 percentage points with strong adjusted EBITDA margins of nearly 30%. Year-on-year, operating margins were impacted by manufacturing productivity, investments in the business and costs related to the food safety separation. These impacts were partially offset by the benefit from leverage on sales growth, strong spending discipline and benefits from restructuring actions.  Lastly, our consumer business posted second quarter sales of $1.3 billion or down 2.5% year-on-year on an organic basis versus last year's 18% comparison. The home improvement business was down high single digits organically, while consumer health and safety declined low single digits as both businesses were up against strong comparisons from a year ago.  Our Stationary and Office business performed well, up mid-single digits year-on-year and Homecare was up low single digits. Consumer's operating income was $247 million, down 15% compared to last year. Operating margins were 18.5%, down 2.2 percentage points year-on-year. Our consumer business operating margins were impacted by ongoing supply chain constraints and manufacturing productivity impacts. These headwinds were partially offset by strong spending discipline and benefits from restructuring actions. Please turn to Slide 23 for a discussion on our 2022 outlook. As you know, the macro environment remains uncertain with mixed trends and signals across geographies and end markets. For example, improving build rate trends in automotive; continued strong demand in semiconductor, data center and factory automation; increasing healthcare elective procedure volumes; and a strong bounce back in China, following April and May COVID-related lockdowns.  However, there are also continued challenges and areas of concern that we are monitoring, including the stubborn and evolving impacts of COVID; global supply chain and logistics challenges; persistent and broad-based inflation, which is pressuring consumers' purchasing power and shifting spending patterns; softening trends in consumer electronics; and geopolitical uncertainties, particularly in Europe.  We are working through these challenges and are taking actions such that we expect to offset the majority of these headwinds. However, as I mentioned earlier, the strength of the US dollar is having an increasing impact on our top and bottom line, which is the primary factor driving our update to full year guidance. Foreign currency translation is now expected to be a full year headwind on of minus 4% versus minus 1% previously.  This FX headwind is resulting in a reduction of over $1 billion in annual sales and is also accounting for nearly 80% of the adjustment in our full year earnings expectation. Therefore, we now expect full year earnings in the range of $10.30 to $10.80 versus a prior range of $10.75 to $11.25.  Given our first half performance, along with the continued uncertain environment, we also believe it is prudent to adjust our organic growth expectations. Therefore, we now expect full year organic growth in the range of 1.5% to 3.5% versus a prior range of 2% to 5%. And finally, we expect adjusted free cash flow conversion to be in the range of 90% to 100%.  Before I wrap up, let me make a few comments regarding the third quarter. First, we currently anticipate an approximate 5 percentage point headwind to total sales from foreign currency translation. While build rate forecast for automotive have moderated, we see easier comps here in Q3 versus last year. US medical elective procedure volumes are expected to be in the range of 90% to 95% of pre-COVID levels, while oral care volumes are estimated at approximately 90%. We expect a headwind of $100 million to $200 million year-on-year from the ongoing decline in disposable respirator demand. We continue to closely watch weakening consumer electronics demand trends and overall consumer sentiment and spending. And finally, looking at raw materials and logistics costs, we anticipate a Q3 year-on-year headwind of approximately to $225 million, which we expect to be able to navigate and offset to price actions. To wrap up, our team delivered 1 percentage organic sales growth in the quarter, 21% adjusted margins and generated $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow. I want to thank our customers and suppliers for their partnerships and the 3M employees for their hard work and dedication, as they continue delivering for our customers. While the macro environment continues to be extremely fluid, the 3M team remains focused on serving our customers and delivering a strong second half of the year. We will remain focused on investing in favorable macro trends, increasing operating rigor through a focus on deep root causes and driving working capital intensity to further strengthen cash flow. I'm excited about the future of new 3M and our health care business. We believe that today's announcements position the company to drive significant long-term value for our customers, employees and shareholders. Our businesses and capital structure are strong, and we are well positioned for success. That concludes my remarks for the second quarter. With that, we will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin: Yes. Good morning.\nMike Roman: Hey, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Yes. First of all, congratulations on achieving these key milestones. I'm sure the team worked incredibly hard to achieve that. So congrats.\nMike Roman: Thank you, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: My first question, so maybe not for Mike, not for Monish, Kevin is on the phone as well. So we're getting a lot of questions about just the structure for the Combat Arms. Kevin, could you just talk about the process for sort of ring fencing the Combat Arms liability. You highlighted an estimator -- how much of it is sort of this -- how much of this estimate is sort of discretionary in nature? How much of it is based on precedents? Just maybe explain the process a little bit better to us, because my understanding is that it is a fairly complex process to come up with a number, but any help would be useful. Thank you.\nMike Roman: Yes. Maybe, Andrew, maybe I'll start with it, and Kevin can add some details as well. So as we talked about in the prepared remarks, Aearo Technologies operating entity in 3M is voluntarily taking on this liability. And it's really about us, 3M stepping up to do what's right here. Do right by veterans and drive more certainty, drive better clarity for everyone involved. As we talked about, we are committed to fund the trust, and this is based on the analysis by an experienced estimator of claims. The third-party that we're working with an economic consulting firm, Bates White is the one that developed the estimate for us. We believe the $1 billion is the appropriate amount based on that expert analysis. And we are -- as part of this process, we'll provide additional funding if required under the terms of the agreement, so that's the basis for that $1 billion. Kevin, I don't know if you have anything to add to that?\nKevin Rhodes: Yes. Thanks, Mike. I'll just add that the analysis will be explained in the next report that will be reviewed as part of the Chapter 11 proceeding. It's important to note that the Chapter 11 court will oversee this process and the claimants will be represented as well. And the goal is to have the court help Aearo establish this trust funded by 3M, as Mike said, and those seeking compensation can present their claims to the trust rather than going through the litigation process on a case-by-case basis.\nAndrew Obin: And does this number get updated on a regular basis in the Q or intra-quarter, or it's just we're going to get big updates as things evolve or no updates at all?\nKevin Rhodes: So this is the commitment to fund the trust of $1 billion at the end of the process when the trust is established, that's when the proceeding will be concluded.\nAndrew Obin: Got you. Thank you. And just a follow-up question. I guess this question is for Mike. There's a lot of talk about recession, right? There are headlines that we're technically in a recession. You did address inflation, consumer slowing. But just from your perspective, you have such broad exposure to the economy. What do you think we are in the economic cycle? And how does it sort of figure in your planning for the second half of the year and as you start initial budgeting process for 2023? Thanks a lot.\nMike Roman: Yes. Andrew, maybe I'll start. In Q2, we saw most of our end markets remain strong. And like everybody else, we saw some softening in the macro, both IPI and GDP. As we look forward, it's really important in the current backdrop -- economic backdrop to look at individual markets. And we're seeing some positive signs. We see elective procedures continuing to improve kind of sequentially as we go. We'll see a second half improvement in build rates for automotive versus first half. There's some areas of softness in our individual markets. We're looking at consumer electronics for example that has now an outlook for the total year that will be negative growth for that segment. We're watching, I would say, consumer and retail spending closely with the focus on inventory and the retail customers and also just the general dynamic around spending is some of the challenges with inflation causing some shifts and where consumers are spending their money. So we're watching that closely. There's a few other areas that really are looking at it. We see Europe and really broadly EMEA down in the second quarter and impacted by geopolitical impacts, COVID, I would say, inflation impacting. So just general, some softness there as well. So all of this, when you put it together, it's leaving us with some uncertainty around the economic outlook. So that's the way I would wrap it up as we go into the second half, we're cautious about where the economy is going. We're watching it closely.\nMonish Patolawala: Andrew, I have to add FX, foreign exchange, down 4% for the year, down 5% for the third quarter. As you know, that strong dollar does impact our earnings. And that's why 80% of our guide down was due to FX. So that's the other piece I would add to Mike's comments.\nAndrew Obin: Really appreciate it. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. You may proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Good morning guys, and congrats on the health care spin announcement. That seems like a smart move. I hate to chime in Monish here. But on slide 18, since you guys don't give us price anymore, can you just give us at least some sense of what -- you've got a $0.36 raw material impact, if price came close to offsetting that, or just give us a little bit of sense of the progress you've made on the price cost?\nMonish Patolawala: Sure, Scott. I'll take that. As I've mentioned before, the teams have done a very disciplined approach to pricing actions across multiple markets, multiple geographies. As you know, we don't do just cost plus pricing. So we take into account our competitive position. We take into account market situations, the inflation that has by commodity. So when you put all that together, I would say, between the businesses and the product line, that's somewhere between low single digits to high single digits. But if I do a weighted average of that, I would say mid-single digits, Scott, is where we came in on price. So we did offset inflation. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are managing inflation through pricing actions. And in the second half, we continue to see broad-based inflation. So we updated our inflation guide to nearly 750 to 850 versus the earlier range we had, which was in the 350 to 450 range. And even there, we continue to manage that inflation, we continue to take price. I don't know if I answered your question, but I think that was your question.\nScott Davis: Yeah. No, that's helpful, Monish. And just going back to Andrew's question on slide 15, where you talk about Aearo Technology is being always operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary. Is there some sort of -- is there a litmus test there on whether it was truly integrated or funds coming, or the ERP systems coming old? I mean, I just remember and effetely from the asbestos days that there were lines it couldn't cross to be able to keep something separate and put a liability into a separate entity like this?\nKevin Rhodes: Yeah. So Aearo, I'll take this. So Aearo has been a wholly-owned subsidiary since the 2008 acquisition. It has continued to operate and it's important to note that the Aero entities have been involved in the Combat Arms litigation from the beginning. They are named as co-defendants in the litigation and they launched, manufactured and actually sold the majority of the Combat Arms Earplugs that issued before the 2008 acquisition by 3M.\nMonish Patolawala: And Scott, we don't see a reason why we can't have our systems, especially your question on ERPs, separate the two entities up.\nScott Davis: Okay. So ultimately, there will be a judge's ruling on that, I would assume, perhaps. Is that correct?\nKevin Rhodes: Yes, it's correct.\nScott Davis: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.\nMonish Patolawala: Yeah. Thanks Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. You may proceed with your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning guys.\nMike Roman: Good morning.\nMonish Patolawala: Good morning.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Mike, can you give a little more color on what you're seeing by region? I know you mentioned Europe and potential weakness there in the second half. But you also talked about China and stronger-than-expected improvement in June, and it was down 8% in Q2. So what do you think growth looks like for the rest of the year there? And how worried are you about a bigger slowdown in Europe?\nMike Roman: Yeah. It's maybe just to give you those two areas in particular. So China, as Monish highlighted in his prepared remarks, we saw better-than-expected recovery in June to the lockdowns that we were seeing than the soft start to April, May that we talked a bit about in China. So, as we go forward and for the quarter, you're right, it's down high single-digits year-on-year. GDP still looks positive in Q2. As we go forward, part of the answer is going to be how quickly does it recover? What is the impact going forward of COVID as any potential additional lockdown. So, it's really looking at where we go there. I mean China continues to be an important market for 3M. It's -- the macro backdrop shows a good positive backdrop, but it's really going to be how all things progress relative to COVID and the recovery from COVID than what else comes our way as we go through the quarter and through the rest of the year. Back to Europe, our declines there were really led by Consumer and Safety and Industrial. Healthcare was still growing strong in the quarter. We saw some strong growth in individual market segments. Back to my comments, the current outlook and the current growth is market-dependent as opposed to broad-based one view of everything. And so I think Europe is at it. We've got the geopolitical risks there. We've got the impact of the supply chain issues and challenges and inflation as well. So, down in the quarter and we think a soft outlook as we look at the second half.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: That's helpful, Mike. And then maybe you could give a little more color into how the change in you're approaching the Combat Arms situations impacting your total litigation costs. Does it lower 3M's overall litigation costs even in the short to longer term? How does it work in terms of -- because you've been spending call it, 5% to 6% of EPS has been -- you've separated that for us. Does that now go down, up? How do we think about that with the change today?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So the way we work, Andrew, is when we came into the year, we had told you approximately $0.60 of adjusted earnings of litigation-related expenses. That number has been updated for three items. Item number one is the pretax charge that we will take as a part of the Combat Arms litigation, which is approximately $1.2 billion. The second one is the charge that we announced earlier in the quarter about our Zwijndrecht thing, which is $355 million. And for the year, that will be approximately $500 million. And then the item which was around $0.60 of litigation-related expenses now with the way this transaction will work out is around $0.55. So put all that together, that's approximately $2.2 billion of adjusted earnings for litigation-related and Zwijndrecht-related items. So hopefully, that answers your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Thanks for that Monish.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan Securities. You may proceed with your question.\nStephen Tusa: Hey guys. good morning.\nStephen Tusa: Hi Steve.\nStephen Tusa: Are there any -- what are the risks around creating the structure for this entity? How do you kind of gauge the in this political environment, any kind of risk to not being able to kind of execute on this, or your lawyers kind of tell you it's pretty iron-clad?\nMike Roman: Yes, Steve, there's certainly -- there are process steps that we will go through as we file today for the Aearo Technologies. And so there are -- we have to work through each of those steps. So, there's always decisions that are made along the way. So, I think that's part of gaining certainty as we go and we'll keep everybody updated. I don't know, Kevin, do you want to make any comments specifically?\nKevin Rhodes: Yes. Certainly, while most Chapter 11 proceedings are contested, Steven. We've -- we're prepared to move forward and we believe the applicable law supports our position as we move forward into this process. And the goal, again, is to remove uncertainty to set up a more efficient and equitable process for establishing a fund to compensate claimants who are entitled to compensation as opposed to the process of continuing to litigate on a claim-by-claim basis.\nStephen Tusa: Got it. Helpful. And then just one quick follow-up on, how you're kind of preparing for a potential pullback in demand more broadly. When you look at what happened in COVID, all you guys took a lot of temporary cost out able to defend the margins pretty nicely. What are kind of the contingencies this time around? Did the things -- are things going to be a little bit different or should we look at COVID as kind of like the same playbook if we do see a significant macro pullback in the next couple of quarters?\nMike Roman: Yes, Steve, I think as you've seen, we manage into recessions and through any kind of slowdowns with a broad-based approach. And we'll do what's needed given the economic conditions. As I said, we're watching how each of the market demand areas are developing, how the overall macro is developing, what's going on, on the global economic outlook. And we'll take actions as required and it will be -- in what we do in our factories and how we manage our commercial businesses and how we operate the company. So, we'll keep you updated as we get a better view.\nStephen Tusa: Excellent. Thanks.\nMike Roman: Definitely, Steve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. \nMike Roman: Good morning, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Yeah, thanks. Just wanted to go back to the bankruptcy filing. So when you put Aearo into Chapter 11, do you move EBITDA in that business? How does that work?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes, Nigel. Depending on how the bankruptcy proceeding goes, the plan will be to deconsolidate that entity, but the overall revenue and earnings are immaterial in the grand scheme of things.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Okay. We'll move off-line there. And then is the -- I mean there is controversy around the structure and those appeals and the congressional bickering about it. But how contingent is the Healthcare separation on a successful filing for Aearo? I mean is one continent in the other? So, can you still go ahead and separate Healthcare even if the filing for Aearo is unresolved?\nMike Roman: Yes. Nigel, we did announce both actions today. They're really the result of separate kind of strategies and decisions. Healthcare spin was based on, as you know, we actively manage our portfolio. We look at broadly where to invest in our portfolio where acquisitions make sense and how do we get the most value out of it and that's what was behind the decision to ultimately spin the Healthcare.  We've invested in strategies to create a stronger Healthcare company. It's is well positioned to succeed and have a great future as a stand-alone company and that really drove that decision. The decision to really take the steps related to Combat Arms Litigation came out of really, first and foremost, the result of the bellwether trial. They were highly variable. We believe it would take years to litigate those claims. And so given a choice between a costly litigation process, we -- in a better, fair, more efficient resolution. That's what drove the decision to step into the new actions that we're taking. So they were -- they happened to be announced in the same day, but they're really based on separate strategies. And both really helping to set us up for, I think, well positioned for, as we said at the top, greater opportunity with the spin and more certainty with the actions we're taking related to Combat Arms.\nNigel Coe: Thanks Mike. And then if I can just follow up. We get a lot of questions from investors around, obviously, the $1 billion is what you put in initially. But obviously, the plaintiffs will be at a much, much higher level. So a seam in the structure is approved. How does that gap get bridged between the $1 billion you putting in and, obviously, the plaintiffs are at a much, much higher level? How does that get resolved?\nMike Roman: Well, based on what we're doing, there will be a separate process that will be a different process. Kevin can talk about how that proceeds. But there will be -- in the court that takes responsibility for these proceedings, they will oversee a process there. But we believe that, as I said, we're committed to a fund that was based on, we think, appropriate analysis from an expert outside firm. But Kevin can talk about the steps of that process and how that resolves.\nKevin Rhodes: Yes. As part of the Chapter 11 proceeding, there will be a claims estimation process where the court oversees that process. And we believe that the $1 billion that we have committed based on the external analysis is sufficient to fund a trust for those claimants who are entitled to compensation. The proceedings will be the subject of expert reports overseen by the court. The claimants will be represented as well. And we believe this is a number that is required, the funding agreement. If necessary, 3M is prepared to provide additional funding to resolve this matter at the end of the process.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, Kevin. Very helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everyone and congrats on both announcements.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Joe.\nMonish Patolawala: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Yes. My question is for Kevin, actually, because this is all fairly new to us. I'm just curious. Like, is there some kind of likelihood that the plaintiffs will come back and want their lawsuits to be heard outside of bankruptcy court?\nKevin Rhodes: So, once the Chapter 11 filing is made, there's an automatic state as to the debtor entity, which, in this case, is Aearo Technologies. We are also asking for that automatic state to be extended to 3M. We are funding, according to the terms of the funding, indemnification agreement. We're committing to fund the trust to help the court set up a mechanism for compensation for those claimants entitled to compensation. We're providing that funding through Aearo. So we think we are entitled to as 3M and hope the court will extend the state of litigation to 3M, and that would put a stay on the existing litigation in state and federal court.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then can you guys maybe just provide a little bit more color around the timing, like how this structure actually helps to expedite the timing in getting the resolution with the potential payments?\nKevin Rhodes: Yes. So the Chapter 11 case was just filed this morning. The court has not set a schedule yet. There have been a wide range of duration for other Chapter 11 filings to resolve litigation matters. We're hoping to work through the process and resolve the matter as quickly as possible. We hope that all parties will share that goal and move it along as expeditiously as the court's procedures permit. We'll certainly provide updates as the case progresses. And if you think about this in context, we've participated in the MDL process for the past three years, taking 16 cases through bellwether trials. We're now at the next step, which is to pair 1,500 cases for trials around the country while we await the outcomes of our appeals. So as compared to the process ahead to litigate each of these cases on a case-by-case basis, we believe that the Chapter 11 proceeding will be more expeditious and certainly, will provide more clarity and a way to more efficiently and equitably provide compensation to those who are entitled to it.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. So maybe just wanted to kind of clarify a couple of things on healthcare as there's been a lot of focus on Combat Arms. On the healthcare side, you've had margins down for several quarters now. I know Monish, you always say that volume leverage is the main driver of margins, but at healthcare, that hasn't seemed to be the case most recently. So just wondering kind of when those healthcare margins turn around? Are they going to be up year-on-year in the back half? And also on healthcare, is the plan that -- it's levered at 3, 3.5 times, is the plan you'd get that sort of step one the big dividend back to the RemainCo at that point when it spins out and then step to a year late, so you can start to monetize that just under 20% stake. Is that the way to think about the cash sort of from healthcare?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. I think both great questions, Julian. I'd start with the first question on margins. As we told you, the EBITDA margins for the second quarter were 30%. As we have talked about before, when you compare to prior, you have to take into account the Acelity acquisition and its impact on purchase accounting, et cetera, which depresses the margins. And that's why I would look at EBITDA, which is 30% in the second quarter. For the year 2021, we ended at 31% EBITDA. So hopefully, that answers your question on that range. Back to, do we see it continuing to improve? Absolutely. I mean this is something that the business is doing a really nice job of continuing to manage inflation with price actions. They continue to drive productivity actions. And as the volume starts, which is back to your point, which is volumes drive the biggest leverage, as we are seeing elective procedures starting to go back up and hopefully, it doesn't get impacted by another wave of COVID, you're going to start seeing that business continue to drive the growth in that area. So that answers your question on margin. The team is quite focused on margin, quite focused on driving organizational efficiency through root cause. On your second question about how the dividend works, I'll start by saying, this is still 15, 18 months away. But the way it will work at that moment in time when that spin happens, there will be a dividend payout from healthcare, which currently we are saying is going to be levered 3 to 3.5 times with positioning for rapid deleveraging because of the strong cash flow that healthcare itself generate. As a part of that transaction, 3M will also retain 19.9% equity stake in our healthcare business that we can monetize over time. The whole purpose of -- the whole intent of this transaction is to be as tax efficient and tax-free, for which we will go ahead and file all the requirements that needed to make it tax-free -- and -- but we are in no rush right now to sell the stake once the spin happens, and we'll monetize it over time. And I think that gives us a lot more flexibility for us to pursue strategic options between the dividend that we get as well as the retained stake that we can monetize over time. Hope that helps, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: That's great. Thanks Monish. And then maybe a sort of more reskin of operating guidance question. So if I look at the new guidance, I think it implies 270-ish of earnings per quarter in the second half. You did about 250 in Q2. I don't think FX is getting easier in the back half. Organic volumes probably not better in the second half given the macros. So just trying to understand, what do you think is getting better in that back half versus the second quarter or the first half run rate? Because you're starting out with that FX headwind, maybe there's a little bit less of that in China $0.11 COVID hit. But anything else you'd call out to drive that step-up in earnings?\nMonish Patolawala: Sure, Julian. And I'll give you all the pieces, and I'll try to give you data between sequential and year-on-year. So it's confusing, my apologies upfront. But I'll just start first by saying, yes, FX, you're right, continues to be a pressure. As I've said in my prepared remarks, for the third quarter, FX is at 5%. For the year, it is at 4%. So that actually adds additional pressure first half to second half. But back to your points on the positives and negatives. So we'll start by one, again, in my prepared remarks, I said China, we still came in with a backlog that we expect to clear in the second half. You'll see that in the third and fourth quarter. We came in $140 million down on a year-over-year basis. So there's recovery there. Secondly, if you look at build rates in automotive, first half versus second half, they are up nearly 9%. However, for the year, they are up 5% versus earlier we thought the whole year would be up 9%. You're continuing to see strong demand in semiconductor data centers and factory automation. Third, elective procedures, which were in that range of 85% to 90% in the first quarter moved up to 90% to 95%, we expect that to come back to 100% by the end of fourth quarter. And then lastly, GDP and IPI is still forecasted to be up 3% to 4% -- 3% for the year versus when we started the year, it was 4%. So for the second half, they're still protecting -- projecting a GDP up. On the flip side, on the things, to your point, that have become negative, we talked about FX, we are still seeing the stubborn and evolving impacts of COVID. Supply chain and logistics pressures continue. We are going to see higher inflation in the second half, but we are managing that inflation with price and offsetting that. We are watching consumer behavior because the broad-based inflation is having an impact on consumers' purchasing power. And then we are seeing softening trends in consumer electronics, especially in TVs, but again, if you look at smartphones on a half-over-half basis, smartphones are supposed to be up around 7% to 8%. However, on a year-over-year basis, they're down 4%, okay?  So I'm just giving you some data points and hopefully, that helps. And then the last one, Mike already talked about was geopolitical uncertainties, particularly in Europe. But with all that said, I just want to make sure you do understand the team is doing a great job of continuing to manage this, making sure we're doing whatever it takes to first deliver for our customers because that's our most important priority, spending cost discipline, but at the same time, continuing to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. Because as we think about it, Julian, long-term, all these trends will play themselves out. There are great areas for investment for new 3M, for Healthcare, and we want to keep making sure we're investing for the long run. So, all these actions that we are taking are all about setting both these businesses up to be successful in the long run. Sorry for the long answer, but I just want to make sure you got the data points.\nJulian Mitchell: Thank you for the details.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for all the details this morning.\nMike Roman: Good morning Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Just a question on maybe kind of the perspective capital allocation strategy for RemainCo. You said kind of through the separation, no real change, but just given kind of the focus of the liabilities and the cash coming out with healthcare free cash flow margins being pretty high. Any change in the way folks should think about something like a dividend policy going forward?\nMike Roman: Yes, Josh, I would say I'd start with we're continuing to focus on driving growth and our capital allocation priorities reflect that. And then they will remain unchanged. It's first and foremost, about investing in our business. It's about paying an attractive dividend, a high priority for us and continues to be so looking at strategic M&A that can add value and deliver on greater opportunities for the company. And then it's returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases. And we continue to see that as our set of priorities as we go forward. When you look at new 3M, it's going to be a very strong, focused, well-capitalized business, a leader in highly attractive markets, as we've been talking about on the call. We'll have tremendous cash flow in that business, a strong balance sheet. And as Monish just highlighted, with the proceeds from the spin and the 19.9% retained stake that we can monetize over time, it will get stronger. So, we are -- we will be well positioned to continue to execute those capital priorities and continue to create value.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then just -- I know the historical kind of framework on 3M or the portfolio rationale was that a lot of the IP was domiciled at corporate. I think there's some more diverse assets in Health Care, maybe than some of the other industrial businesses. But are there any dissynergies by virtue of either some of the IP or manufacturing process sourcing that kind of gets separated there when Health Care leaves?\nMike Roman: Yes, Josh, we've long talked about the benefit our businesses have in leveraging the fundamental strengths of 3M. And they've certainly been important to building the Healthcare business, the technologies that we have are unique and differentiated technologies, our manufacturing capabilities, our global capabilities and our brands. And Healthcare as you touched on, with our portfolio strategies, we've built a stronger Healthcare business. We've done it with organic investments and sometimes leveraging some of those key technologies. We've added acquisitions, significant part of the business now with Acelity and M*Modal coming in as part of the business. We've also stepped in to really focus that business through the divestiture of drug delivery and soon the separation of the food safety business. So, all of that has positioned Healthcare not only to be a strong stand-alone company, well positioned to be able to execute those same strategies moving forward. There's always some connectivity to the technologies manufacturing at 3M.  The \u2013 I would say, the connection between Healthcare and the rest of the company is more limited than the three businesses that will make up new 3M. We'll be able to manage that separation well, we think, especially with the focus that Healthcare has on those specific markets. So -- it's been an important part of building it. We think it's well positioned with what we can do in the spin to be able to take it forward.\nMonish Patolawala: Josh, I just want to add a few more things to what Mike just said. We're going to have dedicated teams that are going to drive the separation. Also, just looking at precedent of other sprints publicly, plus some of the experience that we have had with our divestitures in the healthcare space, we believe the separation cost is going to be somewhere in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion that will get played out overtime. Some of it will start now and some of it will play out over the next 24 months. But again, it's quite early in the process. The teams are starting to get ramped up as we get and learn more, we'll definitely keep you posted.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: That\u2019s great. All the best guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. \nMonish Patolawala: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: A couple of cleanup questions here. The first, just -- this wasn't clear, but is the Board considering any other divestitures or spin or is Remainco 3M portfolio going to be as is on a go-forward basis?\nMike Roman: Yes, Deane, our portfolio strategy, it's a continual strategy. We're always evaluating where we want to make change in our portfolio, adding through M&A, managing to optimize the value. So that's something I will continue really as we go forward. I talk a lot about new 3M. We really believe the three businesses that make up that new 3M company will be strong, well positioned for success in their markets. They will leverage well the technology, I guess the heart of 3M, the fundamental strengths of 3M.  So, it's -- it will be a continual process that we -- and strategy that's important. I think our portfolio strategy really complementing what we do with innovation. We're driving innovation, creating new solutions for customers, building new businesses. At the same time, portfolio management make sure we're looking broadly at where we're creating the greatest value and how do we need to think differently about it. So that's not going to change as we execute through the spin.\nDeane Dray: Got it. And then just want to understand, is there a scenario similar to what you're doing in combat arms for PFAS, where you would consider a similar bankruptcy structure. Is this related to this, it wasn't clear in the filing today. Maybe this is a technical question for Kevin. But are you \u2013 is this being filed under a 105A bankruptcy structure? Because it certainly sounds that because that would require all of those sign-ups and approvals, which would suggest there's going to be an extended process there to get to the finish line?\nMike Roman: Yes, Deane maybe I'll take the PFAS part of that question, and then I'll let Kevin answer the 105A question. So, on PFAS, we continue to be focused on practically managing our environmental stewardship and stepping up and following through on our commitments there. We're vigorously defending ourselves in the cases that we have with PFAS. And we're looking to reasonably resolve, remediate where we can. We expect PFAS is going to play out over years. And I would probably leave it at we're well advised of our options.\nDeane Dray: Understood. And Kevin?\nKevin Rhodes: Yes. So we believe that 105(a) does provide authority as well as other provisions of the bankruptcy code, given the Aero technologies liabilities that are included. And so our filings are being completed today, and those will spell out the various bases for seeking the relief that we've asked the Chapter 11 court to provide.\nDeane Dray: Will you also pledge your insurance assets?\nKevin Rhodes: So our insurance assets are part of the ability to -- of funds that we can tap into to fund the trust. If those assets will be the provided, as well as other assets from the company to provide the trust. And I just -- one point to clarify that, it's the Combat Arms liabilities as well as the -- some legacy, some discontinued Aearo Technologies respirator and mask claims, which are part of the filing as well. Some of those are for asbestos exposure, which are under 24G of the code as well.\nDeane Dray: Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question.\nNicole DeBlase: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Nicole.\nNicole DeBlase: Just maybe a couple of questions on the business. I mean, looking at inventory, how would you categorize inventory in the channel versus what's ideal? And I think probably the biggest question would be around how you would view your consumer inventory?\nMike Roman: Yes. Nicole, it's something we watch closely always. It's something that gives us a good indication of the sell-through of each of our businesses. There are certainly some areas that we've seen some inventory build up there related to COVID lockdowns, as an example. We've added some inventory and built some inventory ahead of some ERP go-live actions that we're taking. When we look at the channel inventory, it's been relatively stable. It's having to react to the same kind of supply chain challenges that we are seeing and react to it, disruptions in supply, logistics challenges. So it's a little more dynamic than usual, but pretty well aligned with what we're seeing in terms of demand. We're watching consumer closely. There was elevated inventory in the channel as part of that. That's something that has been very publicly talked about that retail leaders are working through. We're seeing some of that as well. We still see strong sell-out point-of-sale demand there, so something that we're watching closely. And again, it's -- I would say it's more dynamic, but maybe except for something like retail inventory pretty well in line with expected demand.\nNicole DeBlase: Got it. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on price cost. So some kind of key commodities have started to come down. At what point could that start to impact your margin positively. Like is that as soon as could impact the back half of 2022, or is that more of a 2023 margin dynamic at this stage?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes, Nicole. And we watch this closely. As you know, we have exposure to multiple feedstocks, luckily not one of them is overly material. You look at polypropylene, you look at resin, you look at logistics, airfreight costs, et cetera. The thing that we haven't yet seen is sustained reduction. So you get data points like you've seen the data points of oil come down. But how that translates down to the feedstocks because we don't buy crude oil is going to play itself out. So that's what we are watching. And so I don't know whether it impacts 2022 or 2023. But what we do see still right now is there's broad-based inflation all around that is getting pushed down as tiers are getting involved. And as I told you, we have updated our guidance to 750 to 850 of inflation for the year, which is higher than what we thought coming into the year. But at the same time, we are managing that inflation through price. And I think what we'll have to watch is to supply chains get sustainably improved versus one or two data points.\nNicole DeBlase: Understand. You shall pass it on.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho Securities. You may proceed with your question.\nBrett Linzey: Hi. Good morning, all and congrats on today's announcements.\nMike Roman: Thanks, Brett.\nBrett Linzey: I appreciate the color on the separation cost, the $1 billion to $1.5 billion. But I was hoping you could provide some color, insight on what the go-forward standup corporate structure costs will be for the two entities?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. Sure, Brett. So again, I'll give you benchmark data. So we have a placeholder for the healthcare business, there's a bench using standup costs that's approximately $100 million is what we said is public company cost for that size of company. Similarly, right now, what we have penciled in is for new 3M to have around 1.5% of revenue as incremental cost or stranded costs. However, as Mike and I have told you all multiple times, we are all focused on org efficiency. We are still very early in the process, and we're going to keep working this down. We got time until the spin gets done. So we're going to keep trying to be as efficient as we can and make both companies continue to grow above macro pre -- having margin expansion and strong cash.\nBrett Linzey: Okay. Got it. Thanks. And just one last one on the Bellevue facility. So you reached the agreement in early July on some of the actions, the new commitments. Could you just provide us with an update how that facility production is ramping? And are you still partnering with a third party there? Are you going to get back to kind of full run rate in terms of your internal sourcing strategy by the end of the year?\nMike Roman: Yes. Brett, we are in the process of restarting the manufacturing operates in there. It takes some weeks to do that. We reached the agreement. We were pleased with the outcome of the cooperation that we've had with the local authorities there to resolve the matters and move ahead. So we'll be ramping up the full production here soon. So we're staying in touch with our customers, making sure everybody is aware of our time lines, but it's -- we're in the middle of that ramp up.\nBrett Linzey: Okay. Great. Best of luck.\nMike Roman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.\nMike Roman: In summary, we are positioning 3M for the future to create more opportunity and greater certainty. There will be two world-class, well-capitalized public companies. We will work to efficiently and equitably resolve our Combat Arms litigation, and we will maintain our relentless focus on delivering for our customers and shareholders. We remain focused on driving growth and margin expansion and generating strong cash flow. We're excited about the new opportunities to apply 3M Science to life. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."}, {"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 1, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-04-26 10:56:02", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, April 26, 2022. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland: Thank you and good morning, everyone and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial and Transformation Officer; and John Banovetz, our Chief Technology Officer. John is joining us today to discuss our progress on the sustainability goals that we introduced in February last year. Mike, Monash and John will make some formal comments, then we will take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Please turn to slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we will be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note, throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release. Please turn to slide 3. Before I hand the call over to Mike, I would like to take a moment and highlight a financial reporting change we are making starting here in Q1 2022. We recognize that the increases in legal-related charges that we have incurred the past couple of years have impacted investors' understanding of our underlying financial and operating performance. We have been disclosing respirator and PFAS impacts in our public filings and have decided to provide additional disclosure by expanding the scope of our non-GAAP measurement adjustments to include all impacts of accrual changes and legal fees for respirator masks, PFAS and combat arms matters. This change is a result of discussions we have had with many of you, along with recent benchmarking work we have done. This morning, we issued a Form 8-K with updated non-GAAP financial performance history for the past three years. Further, we will be issuing a Form 8-K amending our most recent annual report on Form 10-K to reflect the effects of this change in our non-GAAP measures and changes in segment reporting immediately after filing our Q1 2022 Form 10-Q this afternoon. Also, our Q1 2022 financial performance and full year 2022 guidance in today's press release and presentation incorporate these changes. Please note, that our guidance does not include future changes to reserves for PFAS or combat arms. Highlighted on this slide is the impact of this change to our non-GAAP financial reporting. As you can see, operating margins in 2021 were 22.2% on this new adjusted basis, or up 70 basis points from pre-COVID levels in 2019, versus down 40 basis points on the previous basis. And adjusted EBITDA margins have expanded 110 basis points since 2019 to 27.6%. Looking specifically at our Q1 2022 performance on slide 4, adjusted earnings were $2.65 per share. This result excludes total special items of $0.39 per share, which is comprised of $0.13 of legal related costs in the quarter, along with a $0.26 charge for PFAS-related remediation in Belgium, which we previously announced via a press release and Form 8-K filing on March 30. As we indicated in the March press release and Form 8-K filing, this charge would be reflected as an adjustment in arriving at our first quarter results adjusted for special items. We remain committed to providing strong transparency in reporting our financial performance. And, of course, we are always here to address your questions. With that, please turn to slide five, and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike?\nMike Roman: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In a challenging global environment, 3M delivered a strong start to 2022. As Bruce just noted, to provide additional clarity on litigation-related costs and our underlying business performance, starting in the first quarter, we are reporting adjusted earnings to exclude significant litigation costs, which was $0.13 in Q1. As we communicated on March 30, we also made an additional investment related to our operations in Zwijndrecht, Belgium, which resulted in a $0.26 charge. Excluding this investment, our financial outlook for 2022 remains unchanged. As you recall, at our strategic outlook meeting in February, we committed to driving growth and shareholder value in 2022 by continuing to innovate for our customers and reposition our portfolio to win in attractive markets. We also committed to deliver strong margins, EPS and cash flow through a focus on operational excellence, while continuing to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. In the first quarter, we executed well and followed through on these commitments, which I will discuss on slide six. We're relentlessly focused on serving our customers, while managing supply chain disruptions, inflation and geopolitical pressures. We posted organic growth of 2%, along with sequential margin improvement, adjusted EPS of $2.65 and robust cash generation. Overall, demand is strong, though the global economic outlook has softened due to challenges in certain end markets, evolving impacts from COVID and recent geopolitical events. All of our businesses started the year with good performance. End market demand was strong in Safety and Industrial, partially offset by a decline in disposable respirators. In Transportation and Electronics, our automotive business continued to outperform build rates despite the impact of semiconductor shortages. Healthcare performed well with 5% growth and consumer grew 3% and in addition to 9% growth last year. To position us for long-term growth, we continue to prioritize investments in high-growth opportunities across our businesses, commercial opportunities that are sizable and significant. For example, our automotive electrification platform grew 20% organically on the strength of new innovations on top of 30% growth in 2021. In health care, our biopharma business posted 15% organic growth as 3M Science advances the development and manufacturing of new therapeutics and vaccines. To support growing demand for our biopharma solutions, we are investing $35 million to double capacity at our plant in Columbia, Missouri. We also continue to manage our portfolio and unlock value for our customers and shareholders. We are on track to close the divestiture of our food safety business in the third quarter. And in March, we divested our floor products business in Western Europe, enabling us to prioritize other parts of our consumer business. In addition, yesterday, we announced that we acquired the technology assets of LeanTec a provider of digital inventory management solutions for the automotive aftermarket segment in the United States and Canada. It is another example of how we win in the core and build for the future, creating new platforms to access emerging trends and opportunities. In this case, the connected bodyshop, one of 3M's digital platforms that brings together data, analytics and material science. We continue to navigate global supply chain disruptions, which have been amplified by recent geopolitical unrest. We are doing whatever is necessary to take care of customers, while managing extended lead-times and elevated inventory levels. At the same time, we have continued to drive strong pricing to offset inflation. Like many other global companies, we are actively managing through the conflict in Ukraine. Our focus remains on ensuring the safety of 3Mers in harm's way. I am proud how 3M has stepped up to help from donating nearly $4 million to employees welcoming refugees into their homes. We stand with our Ukrainian colleagues and have suspended operations in Russia. Given what we are seeing around the world, we expect supply chain challenges to persist for the foreseeable future. Our balance sheet remains strong, allowing us to invest in the business while returning $1.6 billion in the quarter to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. We increased our dividend in the first quarter, marking our 64th consecutive year of increases. With respect to litigation, we are vigorously defending ourselves in combat arms bellwether cases. We are pleased that a jury cited with 3M in the most recent bellwether trial earlier this month, which was a plaintiff's counsel pick. To-date, we have won six and lost eight trials and have appealed or will appeal all adverse verdicts. Eight bellwethers were also dismissed by plaintiffs before they went to trial. I would also like to provide an update on operational disruptions at our factory in Zwijndrecht, which I know is top of mind. Last month, I visited Belgium to meet with local leaders and affirm our commitment to the Zwijndrecht community. As previously stated, we continue to work with Flemish authorities to address our remediation obligations and work toward greater operational certainty. Last September, we announced an investment of \u20ac125 million to advance air and water stewardship in our existing operations, which has included the installation of a new state-of-the-art filtration system. In addition, last month, we committed \u20ac150 million to remediation that addresses legacy manufacturing and disposal of PFAS on 3M site and in the surrounding area. To help reduce the impact to customers, we are supplying from other global sites and actively working to address any future potential impacts. We will continue to collaborate with officials to bring idle processes back online in Zwijndrecht, deliver essential products to our customers and follow through on our commitments. On May 11, we will publish our Global Impact Report, highlighting our progress to our sustainability commitments. In a moment, 3M's Chief Technology Officer, John Banovetz, will provide an update on an important part of these commitments, our environmental stewardship goals. In summary, the first quarter was a good start to the year for 3M, and I thank all of our employees for their contributions. As I mentioned earlier, we are committed to addressing the broader challenges of supply chain disruption and litigation risk as we continue to invest in our underlying businesses, which remain strong and well positioned to grow. We are maintaining our full year expectations as adjusted for the reporting change that we have discussed, which will provide greater clarity regarding our underlying performance as we navigate litigation matters. At 3M, we are driven by purpose and powered by four industry-leading businesses, unique global capabilities and a highly experienced and diverse team. I am confident in our ability to grow above the macro and improve our operational performance as we move through 2022. I will now turn it over to John Banovetz. John?\nJohn Banovetz: Thank you, Mike. And please turn to slide 7. As a global manufacturer, 3M has a long record of environmental stewardship. Over the last two decades, we have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 75%, while more than doubling our revenue. Nearly 50% of our global electricity use is renewable, on our way to 100%. And over the last five years, our innovations have helped customers avoid 100 million tons of emissions. To drive our growth as a company, we will continue to build on our strong foundation, advance our strategy and invest in science-based commitments to improve the environment. Last year, we accelerated our leadership with a commitment to invest $1 billion and deliver our new goals around air, water and waste. As you see on the left side of the slide, our goals are meaningful, authentic and impactful to the world. They are rooted in 3M science, applying math to a path to rapidly bend the curve on emissions. We committed to a 10% reduction in water use by 2022 and a 25% reduction by 2030. To improve water quality, we committed to install filtration technology by 2023 at our largest water using sites, and we committed to become carbon neutral with aggressive milestones along the way. Finally, we will reduce our use of virgin fossil-based plastic by 125 million pounds by 2025. Over the last year, we have made strong progress on each of our goals, putting us ahead of schedule in some areas and on track in all other areas. We have already cut our carbon footprint by 25% and reduced our use of water by more than 10%, which included a new closed-loop water recirculation system at our factory indicator, Alabama. As Mike mentioned, we've also advanced our filtration capabilities in Zwijndrecht with a new state-of-the-art system. Part of the \u20ac125 million investment we announced last September with additional work completed at several other 3M sites. Later this year, in Cordova, Illinois, for example, new filtration technologies will be fully installed, including ion exchange and reverse osmosis. We've announced $165 million investment in Cottage Grove, Minnesota, which follows our decision last year to close our incinerator, resulting in improved waste management while reducing energy and water usage at the site. In addition, over the last year, we have reduced our use of plastic by 19 million pounds through innovative designs in our consumer business, such as our Scotch double-sided mounting tape, which we reformulated to eliminate PVC plastic and packaging and reduce our solvent use by 300,000 pounds per year. In summary, we are on track to meet or exceed each of the goals laid out last February, and we will advance our progress in 2022. This year, we expect to reduce our water usage by an additional 5%, double our reduction of virgin-based plastic and further expand our filtration capabilities across our largest water using sites. I'm proud of how 3Mers have come together to follow through on our commitments. Moving forward, we will continue to work with communities, customers and governments to advance our environmental stewardship and make a difference in the world. As Mike mentioned, I encourage you to read our annual global impact report to be released on May 11 with more details on our priorities and progress. Now, I will turn it to Monish, who will cover the details of the quarter. Monish?\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you, John. And I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to slide nine. The 3M team delivered strong execution in Q1 in a macro environment that remains extremely fluid and increasingly uncertain. We remained focused on delivering for our customers, drove operational execution and maintained cost discipline, while also continuing to invest in the business to fuel growth. First quarter total sales were $8.8 billion, which increased 1.7% on an organic basis. As a reminder, organic sales growth does not include impacts from FX or M&A. Adjusted operating income was $1.9 billion, with adjusted operating margins of 21.4% and adjusted earnings per share of $2.65. On this slide, you can see the components that impacted our operating margins and earnings per share performance as compared to Q1 last year. We continue to drive price actions, realize savings from past restructuring and maintain strong spending discipline, which helped offset both known and new headwinds. As I highlighted in my February Investor Day presentation, we made significant progress driving actions in 2021 to address rising raw material and logistics costs. We are leveraging the power of daily management, data and data analytics, along with the spirit of embracing the red to direct actions to offset the inflationary pressures. During last year, we developed new sourcing and pricing tools and processes to improve agility, drive alignment and simplify our processes. In addition, we are also enhancing our reporting and data analytics capabilities by rolling out tools that model price realization, leakage and elasticity. These efforts continue to pay off in Q1 as benefits from selling price actions offset raw material and logistics headwinds. Looking ahead, while we see raw material and logistics inflation persisting, we will continue to leverage daily management powered by data and data analytics with the expectation of offsetting raw material and logistics inflation through pricing actions in 2022. Also, during the first quarter, we completed the final actions related to our December 2020 restructuring announcement. Since Q4 2020, we have incurred total pretax restructuring charges of approximately $280 million versus an original expectation of $250 million to $300 million. These actions are expected to deliver total pretax savings of approximately $250 million are at the top end of our estimated range of $200 million to $250 million. We realized $180 million of the savings in 2021 and expect the balance of the savings of $70 million in 2022, which is incorporated in our guidance. In the quarter, we experienced a year-on-year decline in disposable respirator demand of nearly $50 million, which negatively impacted operating margins by 10 basis points and earnings by $0.03 a share. On any given day, our global sourcing, manufacturing, and supply chain teams continue to navigate a number of items, including raw material and logistics availability, evolving COVID-related impacts, including mandated lockdowns, employee absenteeism in our US factories in January and February, and now in China, the continued shutdown of certain operations in our plant in Belgium, and recently, the impacts on the geopolitical crisis in the Ukraine. These dynamics continue to result in ongoing changes to demand plans, along with increasing costs and pressuring manufacturing productivity as we work to serve our customers. Also, as you will hear from me throughout the year, we continue to prioritize investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability to drive long-term performance and capitalize on trends in large, attractive markets, including automotive, home improvement, safety, health care, electronics, and software. Moving to raw materials, we continue to experience inflationary pressures with a year-on-year increase of approximately $215 million in the quarter, which resulted in a headwind of 2.4 percentage points to margins and $0.30 per share to earnings. Foreign exchange fluctuation is something we are watching closely, particularly given the geopolitical uncertainties. During the quarter, FX was a benefit of 10 basis points to margins, however, was a negative $0.04 per share impact to earnings year-on-year, primarily the result of the strength of the US dollar. Other financial items increased earnings by a net $0.04 per share year-on-year with benefits from a lower share count and a decline in net interest expense, more than offsetting a headwind from a higher tax rate. While year-on-year margins and earnings declined, it is also important to look sequentially given the fluid and uncertain environment. Our actions to continue to drive price to offset inflation, navigate supply chain challenges and control costs enabled us to expand adjusted margins and earnings 140 basis points and $0.20 per share, respectively. Please turn to slide 10. First quarter adjusted free cash flow was $715 million, with conversion of 47%, which was in line with our expectations. Year-on-year conversion was lower due to higher cash compensation and an increase in CapEx for growth and sustainability investments. Looking at the full year, our free cash flow conversion expectations of 90% to 100% remain unchanged. As you know, we currently have a very fluid environment, especially around global supply chain and logistic challenges. Therefore, we will experience some working capital ups and downs in the short run, but you should see the benefits of the power of data and analytics and operational rigor start to play out once things stabilize. Capital expenditures were $424 million in the quarter, up 37% year-on-year as we increase investments in growth, productivity and sustainability. For the full year, we continue to expect CapEx to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $2 billion. During the quarter, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $852 million and share repurchases of $773 million. Our cash flow the global economic situation and our stock price are all factors into determining the pace and amount of share repurchases. We believe our current stock price presents a good buying opportunity and we have been active in the market to start the year. While we are currently out of the market due to the pending food safety divestiture, we currently anticipate $2 billion in aggregate share repurchases over the course of the full year. Net debt stands at $13.3 billion, up approximately 2% as we continue to invest in the business. Our capital structure is well positioned, giving us financial flexibility and optionality. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation capability, along with disciplined capital allocation continues to provide us the financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities and return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure. Please turn to slide 12 for our business group performance for Q1. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted organic growth of 0.5% year-on-year in the first quarter. This result included a disposable respirator sales decline of approximately $50 million year-on-year, which negatively impacted Safety and Industrial's Q1 organic growth by 1.5 percentage points. Our Personal Safety business declined mid-single digits organically versus last year's 20% pandemic-driven comparison. Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate that COVID-related disposable respirator demand will decline as we move through 2022. However, if trends change, we remain prepared to respond to changes in demand as COVID impacts evolve. Turning to the rest of Safety and Industrial. Industrial adhesives and tapes electrical markets, abrasives and closure and masking were all up mid-single digits compared to last year, while roofing granules and automotive aftermarket businesses were up low single digits. Safety and Industrial's first quarter adjusted operating income was $699 million, down 14% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 22.9%, down 3.5 percentage points. Year-on-year, adjusted operating margin performance was impacted by higher raw materials and logistics costs and manufacturing productivity headwind. Partially offsetting these impacts were selling price increases, spending discipline and benefits from restructuring actions. The Safety and Industrial business group continues to focus on building the future through emerging trends and opportunities. Most recently, 3M acquired the technology assets of LeanTec to advance digital solutions for auto body shops. This digital platform integrates data capture and analysis with material product platforms, providing shop owners and managers more access to data for enhanced productivity and inventory management. Moving to Transportation and Electronics on slide 13, which declined 0.3% on an organic basis, primarily due to the ongoing impact of semiconductor supply chain constraints on the automotive and consumer electronics end markets. Organic sales in our auto OEM business were flat year-on-year, versus a 5% decline in global car and light truck builds, as we continue to gain penetration on automotive platforms. Our electronics-related business declined low single digits organically, with declines across consumer electronics, particularly smartphones and TVs. These declines were partially offset by continued strong demand for our products and solutions in semiconductor and factory automation end markets. Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Commercial Solutions grew high single digits. Advanced Materials was flat, while transportation safety was down mid-single digits year-on-year. First quarter operating income was $496 million, down 11% year-on-year. Operating margins were 21.2%, down 2 percentage points year-on-year. Operating margins were impacted by higher raw materials and logistics costs, manufacturing productivity impacts and investments in auto electrification. These year-on-year headwinds were partially offset by increases in selling price, strong spending discipline and benefits from restructuring actions. The Transportation and Electronics business group is focused on executing well against its strategic imperatives to build new growth platforms in high-growth segments, including automotive electrification, semiconductor, electronic materials and graphic and architectural films. Turning to our health care business on slide 14, which posted a first quarter organic sales increase of 4.7%, with growth across every business. Our Medical Solutions business increased mid-single digits organically. First quarter US elective medical procedure volumes were approximately 85% to 90% of pre-COVID levels, as COVID slowed the pace of procedures, particularly in January and February. Sales in our Oral Care business grew low single digits year-on-year. Global oral care procedure volumes dipped in January and February due to COVID, but started to recover in March. Overall, patient visits for the quarter were 85% to 90% of pre-pandemic levels. We continue to watch COVID-related trends and its impacts on the global healthcare industry, including labor shortages, which drove lower-than-expected surgical and dental procedure volumes in the quarter. The separation and purification business increased mid-single-digits year-on-year with sustained demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccines and therapeutics. Health Information Systems grew mid-single-digits, driven by strong growth in revenue cycle management and clinician solutions. And finally, food safety increased high single-digits. As Mike mentioned, we remain on track for a Q3 close of the planned divestiture of this business, which will be combined with Neogen. Healthcare's first quarter operating income was $448 million down 3.5% year-on-year. Operating margins were 21.1%, down 1.4 percentage points. Year-on-year operating margins were impacted by raw materials and logistics costs, manufacturing productivity, investments in the business, and food safety deal-related costs. These impacts were partially offset by benefit from leverage on sales growth, strong spending discipline, and benefits from restructuring actions. Despite the current environment, the Healthcare business group is focused on delivering clinically differentiated innovative platforms that improve patient outcomes and reduce cost of care. We have been sharply focused on three key segments; wound care; health care IT; and biopharma filtration. These segments are well supported by key market trends, which include; increasing chronic conditions driven by an aging population; shifting of care to lowest cost setting; improving health care access trends; and finally, digital and connected solutions. Please turn to slide 15. Lastly, our Consumer business delivered first quarter organic growth of 3.4% versus last year, with growth across every business. Our Home Improvement business continued to perform well, up low single-digits on top of last year's growth of over 20%. This business continued to deliver strong growth with our home improvement retail customers in our category-leading Filtrete and Command brands. Stationery and Office and Home Care grew low single-digits organically in Q1. And finally, our Consumer Health and Safety business was up low teens year-on-year. Consumer's operating income was $224 million, down 17% compared to last year. Operating margin was 17.1%, down 3.7 percentage points year-on-year. Historically, Q1 is typically our lowest margin quarter of the year for our consumer business. But this year's operating margin was further impacted by ongoing supply chain constraints, along with higher raw materials and outsourced hard goods manufacturing costs and manufacturing productivity impacts. These headwinds were partially offset by good price performance, strong spending discipline, and benefits from restructuring actions. Continuing to innovate and drive sustainability within the Consumer Business Group is a top priority. As consumers and businesses are increasingly shopping online, they want solutions that protect their packages and content, while making the process more convenient and sustainable than ever. As a result, we recently launched Scotch Cushion Lock, a new sustainable alternative to plastic cushion wrap and a perfect solution for protecting and packaging items with 100% recycled paper. Our Scotch portfolio is centered on innovating and serving this large and growing market. Please turn to slide 17 for a discussion on our 2022 outlook. As you know, most companies are facing a macro environment that has become even more fluid and uncertain due to several factors, including continued global supply chain and logistics challenges, ongoing impact from semiconductor constraints, particularly on the automotive and electronics industries, evolving impacts of COVID-19, growing geopolitical uncertainties, increasing foreign exchange volatility and finally, rising inflationary pressures, including raw materials, logistics, labor and energy costs. This has resulted in softening trends impacting full year growth expectations for GDP and IPI. Both macro indices are now expected to be up approximately 3% versus up 4% at the start of the year. Despite the fluid and uncertain macro environment, we continue to expect organic growth in the range of 2% to 5%. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $10.75 to $11.25. This range incorporates the change to our adjusted earnings that Bruce highlighted at the start of the call. And finally, free cash flow conversion expectations remain in the range of 90% to 100%. Before I wrap up, let me make a few comments regarding the second quarter. First, we are seeing a slow start to sales in April, primarily due to COVID-related impacts in China, along with the geopolitical crisis in the Ukraine. Raw materials and logistics costs are expected to be up, impacting Q2 year-on-year by approximately $225 million. We expect disposable respirator demand to decline both year-on-year and sequentially by approximately $100 million to $200 million. During the first quarter and particularly over the last month, growth expectations for transportation and electronic end markets have moderated. Second quarter global auto builds are currently forecasted to increase approximately 2% year-on-year, however, declined 3% sequentially. And smartphones are forecasted to be up approximately 1% year-on-year, but declined 5% sequentially. We expect both US medical and oral care elective procedure volumes in Q2 in the range of 90% to 95% of pre-COVID levels. And finally, as a reminder, last year's second quarter included an approximately $90 million operating income benefit or $0.12 per share from a Brazilian Supreme Court social tax ruling. To wrap-up, although we remain cautious in this current environment, we are bullish about the long term. We are committed to delivering for our customers, taking appropriate price actions driving operational execution and managing spending, while continuing strong financial rigor and maintaining a strong capital structure and financial flexibility. In the long run, we will grow about the macro, expand margins and deliver strong cash. I want to take a minute to thank the 3M employees for delivering for our customers and shareholders in a very uncertain and fluid environment. Our team delivered 1.7% organic sales growth in the quarter, 21.4% adjusted margin, up 140 basis points sequentially and generated $715 million in adjusted free cash flow. I also want to take a moment to personally thank our customers and suppliers for putting their trust and confidence in us and for maintaining strong and close partnership that help us navigate the current challenges. We had a good start to the year. We are watching the environment closely and working on navigating current challenges, with more work to do. That concludes my remarks for the first quarter. With that, we will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan Securities. You may proceed with your question.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Steve.\nMonish Patolawala: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Can you just maybe give a little more precision on the second quarter? And then, I mean, there's a lot of kind of moderate downward revisions to some of the assumptions. I'm just not 100% clear to me how the guide is reaffirmed, maybe you're talking about more -- you're still within the range but towards the low end? Just kind of those two factors, just to start.\nMonish Patolawala: Sure, Steve. I'll just start with the overall guide for the year. As you know, we don't give quarterly guidance. So the guide for the year, coming into the year was 2% to 5% organic growth. We are continuing to see that, that that's doable in the 2% to the 5% growth, no change there at all. The purpose of giving you the second quarter outlook was just, as you're building your models to help you think through the macroeconomic environment. As I've said, the start to April was slower, mainly driven by China and the work there. But we'll have to see when the lockdowns are released and how fast China ramps up historically when they have the ramp-up is there. So we're just giving you what we've seen in April. And then, you can see some of the macro trends in the auto and consumer industry have gone down sequentially, driven by semiconductor and chip shortages, but health care starts moving up from the 85% to the 90% to the 90% to the 95%. So puts and takes for the year, we still see ourselves getting to the 2% to the 5% range that we told you about with adjusted earnings per share of $10.75 to $11.25. So no change there. Overall, I would say -- and market demand has remained strong in the first quarter. So far, we are seeing it strong, other than for what I told you about China, but we are overall still seeing markets strong. And I think time will play itself out on how some of these uncertainties go through the year, but bullish about the long term and bullish about the year.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. Great. Thanks a lot.\nMike Roman: Yes. Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. You may proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Good. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nMike Roman: Good morning.\nMonish Patolawala: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Davis: I think a lot of the issues you addressed this morning are pretty comparable to what we've seen everywhere else. But can we talk a little bit about pricing? I know you stopped breaking that out as a line item, but perhaps, you can talk more big picture. I mean, last quarter, you were up 2.6% price and your core volumes this quarter, around 2%, so that would imply you probably -- if I had to guess, you probably a little bit better than that in price and maybe volumes are more flattish on apples-to-apples. But can you talk about kind of the price cost parity goals? I mean when do you think -- given the higher costs that have come in even just in the last month, when do you think you can reach your price cost parity -- can you reach it this year and perhaps when? And directionally, our price is still going up. And I'll pass it on after that. Thank you.\nMonish Patolawala: Sure, Scott. Listen, the team did an amazing job. As I've talked about the tools that we've had, the daily management. Last year, we started slow on pricing, 0.14%, went up to 1.4% in Q3 and 2.6% and in Q4. This quarter, we continued the momentum, which was driven by two pieces, the carryover impact, plus new pricing. As I said in my prepared remarks, we more than offset the amount of inflation. So, if you just do the math on a rate basis, not just on a dollar basis. So, that's -- we got a 3% plus price in the quarter. The team is very focused on looking at the extra inflation that's coming in, they're already working on higher price. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the goal is to offset the extra inflation that we are seeing with extra price and so a really good start to the first quarter.\nScott Davis: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question.\nBruce Jermeland: Nigel, are you there?\nOperator: Mr. Coe, your line is open. You may proceed with your question. \nBruce Jermeland: Operator, why don't we move to the next question please?\nOperator: We will move on to the next one from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning.\nBruce Jermeland: Good morning.\nJulian Mitchell: Good morning. Maybe just a first question around the -- I understood on the Belgian plant, the remediation measures. But it is a topic that you sort of mentioned a bunch of times in recent months, and we get that question a lot on the plant from investors. Just trying to scale sort of the import of the plant to 3M's kind of aggregate operations. Maybe help us understand kind of what impact from the plant production issues is dialed into your guidance now, now that you're sort of giving us a full update with one quarter behind you. Where are we in terms of kind of inventories at that plant that you can keep shipping from it even without full production?\nMike Roman: Yes, Julian. So, as we've talked in the past, we've had some certain operations shut down at that plant, and we continue to work on -- with local authorities on the updated permits that we have there and continue to work to resolve that. We're a leading provider out of that plant for specialty fluids, including heat transfer fluids that are used in semiconductor, and we're working to address the operational disruptions we have. Zwijndrecht is an important source of supply for those materials to our customers. And so we're working to resolve it there, so we can continue to supply from there. We're also looking to supply from capacity that we have at alternative sites where possible. So it's it was an impact that we saw in Q1. It's something that's built into our outlook. It is something we're working with customers on to address any ongoing disruption for them. So it's something we'll keep updating you on as we mitigate the impacts and we can update you as appropriate going forward.\nJulian Mitchell: Understood. But it's not a sort of material headwind dialed in for Q2 or the balance of the year. You can sort of cope with it, the shortage still.\nMike Roman: Yeah. There is a process we're working through. And so there's some uncertainty there. We've got to resolve the permit issues there. We've got a permit renewal as we go through the year. So this is all something that we're working on. We've been careful to say that we have certain operations that have been interrupted at this time. There's a potential for operations to resume. There's a potential for operation \u2013 additional operations to shut down. So we've been careful to lay out the possibilities. What we saw in \u2013 in Q1 was part of our results and is an interruption that we're working on with customers.\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. And then just my follow-up around the EMEA region, you saw organic sales down about 2% there in the first quarter, understood that probably April is maybe trending worse than that based on Monish's comments. Maybe help us understand kind of are you seeing in EMEA exactly? Most companies seem to say it's about the same as it was a few months ago. Your sort of numbers and comments imply that you are seeing some kind of shorter cycle weakness there. So maybe help us understand kind of what's changing in Europe by region or industry in terms of demand for you?\nMike Roman: Yeah. And Julian, as you recall, we realigned around our businesses back in March of 2019. So we really are managing each of our four go-to-market models globally and executing in the areas. We update you on just how we're performing overall in the areas of the world. And so EMEA down 2% in Q1 really was led by declines in our Consumer and Safety and Industrial businesses. Transportation and Electronics was down slightly. Health care was up actually low single digits in the quarter. So we saw some impact from both, I would say, COVID as well as the supply chain disruptions and the \u2013 I would say, the challenges in Ukraine. So it's a \u2013 it is an ongoing dynamic that we're watching closely. We saw strong growth in a number of our businesses as we came through the quarter and Monish walked through the outlook on the macro. So certainly, that will have an impact on EMEA. But I would say we're watching it closely as we look at the rest of the year.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. You may proceed with your question.\nJeff Sprague: Hey. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nMike Roman: Hi, Jeff.\nMonish Patolawala: Good morning, Jeff. \nJeff Sprague: Hey, good morning. Just thinking about the adjusted framework, and I didn't get a chance to go back and look at all the restatements. But just to be clear, -- so on a move-forward basis, we're just excluding litigation and environmental-related costs, both on the go forward and on the way you restated the numbers?\nMonish Patolawala: I'm not sure I follow, Jeff, but you're asking, are we going to a go-forward basis? Yes. So we have made the adjustment that going forward, all costs for significant litigation matters will be shown as an adjustment to our earnings. And so you will see the GAAP EPS number, which is reported and adjusted earnings per share. And we have also filed an 8-K showing you restating the history. And just so that you can catch up on what it was, and Bruce talked about in his prepared remarks is, for example, in 2021, we would have excluded approximately $0.61, which was cost for significant litigation matters as a -- to show it as an adjustment, which will be 140 basis points of margin impact.\nBruce Jermeland: Yes, Jeff, the other comment I would have is, it does not include potential changes in future reserves, just so that's clear.\nJeff Sprague: Yes. I mean the thing that's tricky about this guide, it's not to editorialize, right, but I think you're leaving things like Brazil charges and gains that are truly one-off in the numbers. And stuff like litigation that might be lumpy, but is sort of ongoing and pulling that out of the numbers. I mean, I guess, we all have the discretion to use GAAP if we want. But it's just a confusing construct, I think, to use.\nMonish Patolawala: Fair point, Jeff. Fair point. At the end, listen, the first results are GAAP EPS. There's no going away from that. The reason we have broken this out into TWO was, there was a lot of requests from investors asking us to show -- to bring better clarity to the underlying performance of our business. And we have disclosed $90 million. We disclosed that last year, too. We are disclosing it this year, too, as a reminder of what we disclosed last year. And there was an ask for people to know how much we were spending on cost for our litigation-related matters. So we've shown that as a separate line item. You can put it either way. At the end of the day, GAAP EPS is the first thing. Second is the adjustment. So you can see how much you're spending on litigation and you can see the -- bring clarity to our underlying business. So, hopefully, that clarifies.\nJeff Sprague: YES. Thank you. And then just on the kind of the litigation milestones. Can you update us on what is next on the docket, I believe, there's a few more things on combat arms. Maybe there's some other things we should be aware of, as we're looking over the balance of the year.\nMike Roman: Yes. So Jeff, we still have two combat arms, bellwether cases to go here in May. So those are the next the next two trials on the docket. Beyond that, it's a little less clear what the next cases will be. If you look at PFAS, the other one trial schedules, I would say, have been moving frequently. We we're currently scheduled for two trials this year. We have a June trial in Michigan, and then we have an October trial in Alabama. The Aqueous Film Forming Foam multi-district litigation, the first trial there is not expected until 2023. So that gives you kind of an update.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thank you.\nMike Roman: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citi. You may proceed with your question.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone.\nMike Roman: Hi, Andy.\nMonish Patolawala: Hi, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Monish, to the extent you can, could you give us a little more color on how you're thinking about Safety and Industrial margin moving forward? I know margin was down year-over-year, but it was materially up sequentially versus the last couple of quarters. Is that a function of maybe better mix with mask being a bit stronger? I think you mentioned strong spending discipline restructuring to the extra $70 million restructuring benefits find their way into the segment in the quarter in a bigger way?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So, I would tell you, I'll start, Andy, with -- if you go back to Mike Vale\u2019s comments at Investor Day, he talked about one of his priorities is continuing to drive margin expansion. And we saw that sequentially. We knew going into the year that the year-on-year comp will be difficult, as you correctly pointed out with the amount of inflation. But the team has driven momentum on all items, which is price, continue to see the restructuring benefits, we're able to continue to drive productivity in the factories, at the same time, continue to invest in the right amount of growth as based on the priority platforms that we have listed out, and you saw it in the first quarter. Our mask respirator did come in better. When we had come in in the beginning of the quarter, we had told you it would be down sequentially. $100 million to $150 million. It came in at $50 million down, so we know we came in stronger. I think we'll have to watch what the year plays out when it comes to mask respirator and see where that lands is. We've also told you -- it does have an impact on us on an incremental margin basis. And coming into the year, we had said it to be down 700 on a year-over-year basis. But to sum it up, Mike, Wale, and his team are focused on continuing to drive margin expansion as all the initiatives that they've taken from productivity, price, restructuring continue to play out; offset that and as stability comes in, you'll start seeing the productivity also starting to kick in from a margin perspective. So, a good start to the year.\nAndy Kaplowitz: That's helpful. And I just want to follow up on Jeff's question just to make sure I understand the ongoing litigation costs. It looks like ex the special charge to the Belgium facility that you're guiding to about $0.35 of special items for 2022, but your litigation expenses have been running at like $0.13, $0.14 a quarter. So, are you expecting litigation cost to ramp down as the year goes on? Are there gains you're expecting? Any more color there, am I understanding it right?\nBruce Jermeland: Yes, Andy, this is Bruce. If you look at our press release attachments, we lay out about $600 million in pretax charges estimated for the year. That includes the Zwijndrecht charge that we took in Q1. So, setting that aside, underlying ongoing litigation cost to be about $450 million. From a total EPS impact for the year, we forecast $0.86, which includes $0.26 related to Zwijndrecht charge in Q1. So, yes, the remaining $0.60, we took roughly $0.13 here in Q1.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Thank you.\nBruce Jermeland: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning guys.\nMike Roman: Hi Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey. Bruce, I just wanted to follow up on the $600 million. I'm just curious, like, what does that actually encompass in terms of litigation? And then also, is that all cash?\nBruce Jermeland: Yes. So, when we provided our guidance back in February, encompassed in the $10.15 to $10.65 was a plan of about $0.60 on of costs related to ongoing litigation matters around PFAS, combat arms, and respirator. So -- and then we had an additional $0.26 charge as we announced on March 30th. So that what brings it to a total of $0.86. Relative to cash, Joe, that's difficult to know exactly when that plays out. For example, the $0.26 charge we took here in Q1 will be paid out over time as remediation actions take place. But also, it's important to remember that there is no presumed forecast relative to updates to reserves. So largely, we'll be cash driven, but won't line up 100%.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. That's helpful. And then really, just wanted to follow up on China, I saw that it was down low-single digits in the quarter. I'd be curious, Mike or Monish, maybe just provide how that was trending as the quarter ended and into April. And then also, if you could provide a little bit of end market color, I would imagine that respirator sales are probably holding up a little bit better. But any type of commentary you can provide on trends there by end market would be helpful.\nMike Roman: Yeah. Sure, Joe. I'll start with what you said it were down low-single digits in the first quarter that was reminder a top of 30% or more than 30% growth in Q1 of last year. We\u2019ve been impacted in Q1 by the COVID lockdowns. It's impacting manufacturing and distribution. And we saw that as we finished the quarter \u2013 it's also contributing to, I would say, a soft start to April as well. And it's really driving increasing backlog, factory shutdowns for us, also complying with government safety mandates, you're seeing increased port congestion, reduced air cargo capacity. So a number of things impacting that softer start. I would say it's \u2013 the outlook remains uncertain. It's difficult to predict. We see maybe a one percentage point kind of headwind as we start Q2, but that can change as we go through the year. So it's \u2013 it's important market we're seeing in Q1, we saw health care leading the way up mid-teens. We saw declines across consumer, safety, industrial and transportation and electronics, all down mid-single digits. So that's what got you to the low single digits.\nJoe Ritchie: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin: Thanks. Good morning.\nMike Roman: Hi, Andrew.\nMonish Patolawala: Hey, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Just a question on the consumer business. Historically, looking at your consumer peers gives you a fairly good indication where you guys can come out, but sort of looking at where Avery is, Kimberly, I think Procter & Gamble have reported. Your numbers seem to be this quarter, quite a bit below the peer group. And also, in particular, if you look at some of the verticals that you disclosed like roofing granules, home improvement, separation purification, I would have expected those to do better given the end market? I guess the question I'm asking, we know the issue in the Belgium facility, but should we be thinking about a specific vertical within your technology portfolio that's being particularly impacted by supply chain that sort of gauge your ability to grow in this environment?\nMike Roman: Yeah, Andrew, I would say you highlighted a couple of those particular challenges. The supply chain more broadly is impacting all of our businesses. So we're seeing disruptions in raw materials, logistics, inflation all that's impacting broadly our portfolio. Consumer did have organic growth up 3% in Q1 on top of 9% last year. And it was across all divisions. It was led by consumer health and safety also our home care and our home improvement products continue to lead the way. So we're seeing growth. And stacked on top of last year's growth, we're seeing good continued performance, good performance. They're not seeing any specific or particular impact. And if you look across the portfolio, aside from some of the disruptions from Zwijndrecht, we're not seeing supply chain focused in one part of our portfolio and other. It is, I would say, more -- some of the impacts maybe from COVID having a geographic impact. Health care elective procedures still looking for there. And as Monish highlighted, the outlook for the macro in certain end markets is softening. That's less about supply chain disruptions. Maybe automotive and electronics being impacted by semiconductor shortages but its really more end market slowdowns that are impacting our businesses, where you see an impact on something like electronics or automotive.\nAndrew Obin: Got you. And just a follow-up question. Interesting to note that you guys continue to push into electronics. You highlighted it as one of your sort of technologies within your periodic table. Can you just talk more about sort of potential M&A opportunities when it comes to digital and how do sort of see it fitting into your broader portfolio? Thanks.\nMike Roman: Yes, Andrew, our M&A strategy, an important part of capital allocation. We see it as a place we can create value. And the way we create value there is, as you're pointing at, we look at prioritizing attractive markets, higher growth markets that can leverage 3M capabilities, our technology, our manufacturing, our global reach to customers. And so, that really kind of steers us in our strategy for M&A. And when we can identify companies that we can integrate into 3M and really leverage those strengths of 3M, that's -- and move into more attractive, higher-growth market spaces, that's what's going to drive us, whether it's in opportunities around electronics or any one of our four businesses.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brendan Luecke with Bernstein. You may proceed with your question.\nBrendan Luecke: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question.\nMike Roman: Hey, Brendan.\nMonish Patolawala: Good morning, Brendan.\nBrandon Luecke: So, just, I wanted to circle back on a couple of items from the guidance call earlier this year. Wondering how point of view may have changed given ongoing pressures on the business. So first off, I believe you talked about from 30% incremental net of respirator impact? Is that still a target in light of continued inflationary headwinds? And then, second part would be around operating cash flows. You guys have guided to, I think, $7 billion to $8 billion, but we came in around $1 billion in Q1. Wondering sort of what the puts and takes look like to get to the FY target there.\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So I'll start with your operating leverage question, Brendan. What I've said is, always in the long term, 30% to 40% is what our targeted leverage is, incremental leverage. And when you just think about it and look at our gross margin, which is anywhere between 45% to 50%, you can see you can get to the 30% to 40%. On top of that, what I would tell you, volume gives us the best leverage, so the more we can grow, you're going to get more incremental leverage. Add to that productivity in the factory, strategic sourcing will add more to that leverage and then continued actions to drive simplification, et cetera, all of them drive positive leverage. Then to that, we take some of that and we invest it back into growth, productivity and sustainability and then, of course, manage the litigation matters, et cetera, is ongoing. So when you put all that together, long term 30% to 40% is what is doable. When we came into the guide for the year, we had said its 30% to 40% is our target. We said around 30%. If you look at the midpoint of the range right now, which we have given you, which is 2% to 5% revenue growth, $10.75 to $11.25 on an EPS basis, and you put in FX, which could range anywhere from 1% to 2%, we ended at 2% right now for the first quarter and you assume that carries over, you will see that we are still targeting at the 30%. We are seeing higher inflation as everyone is seeing, but as I've said in my prepared remarks, we are going to offset that inflation, our target to offset that by price actions. We've started strong in the first quarter. You can see incremental leverage was up -- if the math is nearly 70% leverage in the first quarter sequentially and will continue to drive leverage. We, of course, have to factor in all the uncertainty that's going on in the world. But teams committed to driving it and I would say in the long run, also I don't see why we can't get to the 30% to 40%. Hopefully, I answered your question, Brendan, on item one. On your second item on operating cash flow, again, we have reiterated that we are -- and we started the year with 90% to 100% free cash flow conversion. We told you that at Investor Day, we reiterate. We have a path to get to the 90% to 100% free cash flow conversion. The first quarter at a 47% conversion was pretty much what we expected. It was all in the guide in the 90% to the 100%. The first quarter conversion is driven by two pieces. One is higher compensation expenses from a year-over-year basis as we paid out. And secondly is higher investments in sustainability that we had also called out. But if you look at history of 3M, the first quarter is always the lowest from a conversion rates than you build. So, we still see a path to the 90% to the 100%.\nBrendan Luecke: Outstanding. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. good morning.\nMike Roman: Good morning Deane.\nDeane Dray: A question for Monish, please. Just on the FX assumption for the year, 3M, historically, has been one of the few companies that actually use financial hedges on FX. Is this still in place? And there's typically a lag when you use those hedges, so -- versus what you're seeing in the spot market? Just what's -- I can see you've got that 1% to 2% in guidance, but are the hedges at play?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So, we do cash flow hedging, Deane, and that's been done even before my time. The team continues to do that as per the rules that are out there. For the first quarter, it was a -- FX was a $0.04 headwind and then on a revenue, it was a 2% headwind. If you just take -- and it's very volatile, it's all due to the strength of the US dollar. But if you just had to snap the chalk line a week ago and say, if that's what the trend is for the future, I would say on a revenue basis, it's somewhere between 1% to 2% impact. And then from an EPS perspective, it's a $0. 05 to $0.10 headwind we've taken $0.04, so then you'll have another $0.01 to $0.06 again, it's very volatile, Dean. So, it's really hard. I'm just giving you a point in time based on just snapping the chalk line a week ago on those currency rates.\nDeane Dray: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question. \nNigel Coe: Sorry about that. Thanks again for the -- it wasn't mute button issue. I just want to make that very clear. So, -- thanks again. So, just to put a finer point on the guide. I mean you've acknowledged the dollar stronger raw material pressure, China, Europe. So, lots of incremental headwinds, but what is the offset to that, Monish, in terms of keeping the range essentially unchanged?\nMonish Patolawala: So I'll start with just \u2013 you take the top line growth at 2% to 5% that we came into the year with, we continue to see that, Nigel, play itself out. If you take GDP IPI, that's growing, give or take, 3% to 4%. And you take auto build rates, which are still at the 5% growth rate. We have told you we can get 300 to 500 basis points of out build in the long term. You saw in this quarter, the team did on a negative 5% order growth rate they came in at plus \u2013 were flat. So it's 500 basis points. Health care started slow in January and February, we still see ourselves getting to in US elective procedures, 95% to 100%. You look at OCS or oral care, we are starting to see that back. Again, January was down due to the Omicron variant, but we have seen that back up. And then consumer is \u2013 we said low to mid-single digits. That's where they delivered in the first quarter. So that remains as is. So I would say when you look at all of this from a macro perspective for the year as a whole, it's \u2013 we still see ourselves in that range of 2% to 5%. And of course, we continue to get more price to offset the inflation. So that's number one. I would say, secondly, we did bring out the second quarter, because we wanted you all to know what we are seeing from a headwinds perspective, I'm sure you're hearing it from all industries, and we are not telling you anything new that you haven't heard from others. And then on EPS, which is $10.75 to $11.25, I go back to volume gives us the best leverage. So the 2% to 5% growth there plus the continued work that the teams are doing to drive productivity in the factories, strategic sourcing, continuing to be smart about investments in the growth productivity and sustainability. All of that put together, we see the calculus that gets us to the $10.75 to the $11.25, and that's what we are working towards. I think things will play out as they will play out in the short run. But again, I go back to long-term growth about macro margin expansion and cash, it's clearly doable and these short-term headwinds will all play itself out.\nNigel Coe: Okay. That's great. And I know we're running late here. So \u2013 but it seems like you're working around the Belgium facility issue, which is just good news. But it seems to me \u2013 and maybe this is a question for Mike, that Belgium was a symptom of a broader problem, which is to date, we've had litigation actions against PFAS, and now it seems to be more operational. And your Germany, I know was supposing to phase out PFAS products. California has got some similar proposals as well. So how is the Board thinking about this, number one? And then secondly, how material could this be for 3M longer term? Just any color there would be helpful. Thanks.\nMike Roman: Yeah. Nigel, maybe I'll just try to kind of frame this up a little bit. So there are two parts to what we're managing in Zwijndrecht and I would say, in our manufacturing sites around the world, there's a historical impact of the PFAS chemistries, PFOA-PFOS that we exited and announced the exit almost 20 years ago now and \u2013 or exit almost 20 years ago. And then there's ongoing operations. And so we're working on both of those in Zwijndrecht as the charge that we announced in March was to resolve remediation related to that historical PFOA-PFOS manufacturing. And then we're working with the authorities and Flanders around an operating permit going forward. And that's something that we've been doing around the world at our five sites with regulatory authorities and continue to do that. It's \u2013 PFAS continues to be a critical PFAS substances. There's more than 4,000 of them. We continue to have some PFAS in our products that is critical to customer needs in health care, electronics, automotive. And so the -- its something we\u2019re managing with those sites, managing with those authorities and something we'll keep you updated on as appropriate as we go forward.\nNigel Coe: Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.\nMike Roman: To wrap up, we had a good start to the year with solid growth, sequential margin expansion and strong cash generation. We are positioned for a successful 2022, and we'll stay focused on taking care of our customers, driving growth and improving our operational performance. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and we ask that you please disconnect your lines."}], "2024": [{"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 4, "year": 2023, "date": "2024-01-23 12:54:05", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, January 23, 2023. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland: Thank you, and good morning, everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our President and Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments and then we will take your questions. Please note, that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Please turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we will be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note, throughout today's presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release. Please turn to Slide 3. During today's presentation, Mike and Monish will discuss our 2024 outlook. This outlook will be provided on the same adjusted basis used during 2023. In the coming months, there are significant milestones that the company expects to complete, including the spin-off the Health Care business and the finalization of the public water supplier and combat arms legal settlements. The Health Care spend remains on-track for the first half of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions as detailed in our SEC filings. We continue to expect the business to be spun-off with an estimated net leverage of 3x to 3.5x EBITDA, and with the proceeds to be distributed to 3M prior to the completion of the spin. We are working through the processes, with all parties and the courts in both the public water supplier and Combat Arms Earplugs legal settlements. Our goal is our finalization and ultimate implementation. Absent the proceeds from the intended spin-off of the Health Care business, the company has not concluded, how it would fund amounts due under the public water supplier and Combat Arms Earplugs legal settlements. Therefore, we have not included the potential impacts of changes in net debt that may be needed to fund amounts under these agreements. For illustrative purposes only, in the absence of the proceeds from the spin, the adjusted earnings per share impact from financing legal settlements could be up to approximately a $0.20 per share headwind based on current market conditions. Also, please note that we will be treating the dilutive earnings impact of 3M's option to satisfy the $1 billion in payments related to the Combat Arms Earplug settlement with 3M's shares as an adjustment in arriving at results adjusted for special items. Finally, it is important to note that when considering 3M's financials post spin, it is not appropriate to simply remove the Health Care business financial results. There are other factors such as transition services agreements, stranded cost and below the line items that need to be taken into account. We are planning on holding an investor meeting later this year, following the spin of Health Care where we will provide an update to our full year 2024 guidance along with our medium-term financial framework. With that, please turn to Slide 4. And I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike?\nMike Roman : Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 3M delivered a strong fourth quarter as we continued to improve our operational performance, with adjusted EPS growth of 11%, operating margin expansion of 180 basis points and robust cash flow. Monish will cover more details of the quarter, but first, I would like to comment on our full year performance. Throughout 2023, we delivered on our commitments with results that exceeded our original earnings and cash flow guidance. While organic sales declined 3%, reflecting softness in certain end markets, including consumer retail and electronics, our disciplined execution supported year-over-year adjusted margin expansion. Excluding restructuring, we delivered increased margins of 60 basis points, helping drive earnings of $9.24 per share, along with a 30% increase in free cash flow and a conversion rate of 123%. Our strong cash flow enabled us to continue investing in the business, while reducing net debt by $2 billion or 17%, and returning $3.3 billion to shareholders through our dividend. Please turn to Slide 5. As you recall, in January of last year, we committed to take a deeper look at everything we do. Our success in 2023 reflects that commitment along with our execution of three strategic priorities, which are unlocking value for customers and shareholders, both today and into the future. Let me highlight key achievements in these areas, including how we will build on our progress in 2024. Starting with driving performance through the 3M model. In 2023, we implemented the most significant restructuring in 3M's history to streamline the organization, reduce costs at the center, and get us closer to our customers, which generated more than $400 million in savings during the year. These efforts included aggressively cutting management layers, reducing corporate shared services and modernizing our technology by removing hundreds of legacy systems. We reduced rooftops worldwide and took actions to help us address stranded costs, as we progress the Health Care spend. We simplified our supply chains and are doing more to leverage data and data analytics to visualize the flow of goods, so we can serve customers more efficiently. We optimized our global go-to-market models for each of our business groups. And consumer for example, we simplified our division structure with each of our global area teams now better aligned around their prioritized product portfolios and brands. At the same time, we have transitioned to an export-led model in approximately 30 smaller countries around the world, allowing us to reduce costs and complexity while still bringing 3M innovation to local customers. The simplification of our organization also frees up resources to prioritize exciting growth opportunities for 3M, such as automotive electrification, climate technology and industrial automation. While we have more work to do in 2024, our actions are helping us to improve our operational performance and create a more competitive 3M. Our next priority is the spin-off of Solventum, our Health Care business. Last year, we appointed experienced Health Care leaders to Solventum, including Bryan Hanson as CEO, Carrie Cox as Board Chair, and Wayde McMillan as CFO. The spin is on track to be completed in the first half of this year, and we are confident in the value it will create for customers, care providers, patients and shareholders. As we look to 2024, we will continue to optimize our portfolio as we prioritize geographies, markets and products, where we see the greatest opportunity. Finally, we are focused on addressing risk and uncertainty. The Combat Arms settlement we announced last August has received strong support from both claimants and the broader military community. We completed the first three milestones of the settlement as planned, including earlier this month, when we reached agreement with all plaintiffs, who were being prepared for trial. We will continue to work with all parties in the courts to fully implement the settlement. With respect to PFAS, our settlement with public water suppliers is on track for the final approval hearing scheduled for February 2nd. We will continue to address other PFAS litigation by defending ourselves in court or through negotiated resolutions as appropriate. We also remain on schedule to exit all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025, with production volumes down 20%. Looking back, in a year full of change, I am pleased how 3Mers around the world stepped-up to lead. Importantly, we stayed relentlessly focused on doing what 3M does best, using material science to make a difference in the world. I see exciting examples of innovation across our company. Earlier this month, we unveiled the world's first solar powered communications headset, building on our decades of leadership in both personal safety and sustainability. We are advancing more durable, energy efficient and connected vehicles with an array of solutions, including new thermal barrier materials that improve the range and safety of electric car batteries, just one element of our automotive electrification program, which grew 30% in 2023, on top of 30% growth in 2022. Our Medical Solutions business, a world leader in advanced wound care, just announced a partnership with the U.S. Army, where we will collaborate with the military and leading universities to develop traumatic wound solutions. And in Consumer, last year, we launched more than a dozen new products, including new solutions for heavyweight hanging, part of our $0.5 billion Command franchise, which leverages our world-class adhesives technology. 3M's innovation engine is strong. It will remain the heart of our business and our ability to deliver differentiated value for our customers. In summary, the 3M team delivered a successful 2023, and I am confident we will accelerate our progress in the coming year. I will come back to talk about our 2024 priorities and guidance after Monish takes you through the details of the fourth quarter. Monish?\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 6. The fourth quarter culminated a year where we took significant steps to improve our operational execution, resulting in better financial performance. We aggressively controlled spending and initiated restructuring actions to simplify our supply chains, reduce structure and streamline our go-to-market models to better serve customers. At the same time, we continue preparing for the successful spin of our Health Care business and work to reduce risks and uncertainties related to legal matters. While there is more to do, our teams made tremendous progress in 2023 that we build upon in 2024 and beyond. Looking at fourth quarter performance, adjusted sales were $7.7 billion at the high-end of our guidance. End markets continue to play out as anticipated. Notably, the auto OEM market remains strong in the fourth quarter and we saw signs of end market stabilization in consumer electronics. As expected, China and consumer retail end markets continue to be soft. Organic sales on an adjusted basis declined 1.4% versus last year. The expected decline in demand for disposable respirator negatively impacted organic growth by 60 basis points of $50 million. Excluding this impact, Q4 adjusted organic sales were down 80 basis points. Adjusted operating margins were 20.9%, up 180 basis points year-on-year or up 320 basis points excluding the impact of restructuring charges. Adjusted earnings were $2.42 up 11% year-on-year. Versus our guidance, fourth quarter earnings were benefited by $0.06 due to a lower-than-expected tax rate which was partially offset by the acceleration of restructuring actions which impacted earnings by approximately $0.03. And finally, fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow was $2 billion up 18% year-on-year. For the full year, we delivered $6.3 billion in adjusted free cash flow versus an originally expected range of $4.2 billion to $5 billion at the start of the year. Please turn to Slide 7 for a recap of the components that drove our year-on-year operating margin and earnings performance. Benefits from manufacturing productivity, sourcing actions, restructuring, strong spending discipline and selling prices more than offset headwinds from lower sales volumes, investments in the business and last year's disposable respirator sales comparison. This net benefit drove a year-on-year expansion in Q4 operating margins of 400 basis points and earnings per share of $0.43 per share. Pre-tax restructuring and related charges in the quarter were $109 million, or a negative impact to margins of 140 basis points and $0.17 to earnings. Raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation was a slight year-on-year headwind of 10 basis points to operating margins or minus $0.01 to adjusted earnings per share. Foreign currency translation was a negative 70 basis points impact to adjusted operating margins are negative $0.07 per share. This result was primarily due to the net impact of hedging and the devaluation of the Argentinean peso. As previously mentioned, our adjusted tax rate was lower-than-expected coming in at 14.9%. This compared to 16.6% in last year's fourth quarter, resulting in a $0.05 benefit to earnings. And finally, other financial items and shares outstanding netted to a positive $0.01 per share year-on-year impact. Please turn to Slide 8. Fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow was $2 billion, up 18% year-on-year with conversion of 145%, up 800 basis points versus last year's Q4. Our ongoing focus on working capital management, especially inventory, continues to yield results. Inventory was down $550 million year-on-year and is now at 14.8% of sales, a 90 basis points improvement year-on-year. I am pleased with the progress to-date and see significant opportunity to further improve performance in all aspects of working capital. Adjusted capital expenditures were $308 million, down 32% versus last year's abnormally high fourth quarter. For the year, we invested over $1.4 billion versus an expected range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. And finally, we returned $828 million to shareholders via dividends during the quarter. Turning to the balance sheet. Net debt at the end of Q4, stood at $10 billion, a decline of $2 billion year-on-year or 17%. 3M continues to be a reliable and robust cash generator. In addition, the upcoming spin-off our Health Care business will further strengthen our balance sheet. As Bruce mentioned, we anticipate receiving a 1x dividend from Solventum at an initial leverage of 3x to 3.5x EBITDA. We will also retain a 19.9% equity stake, which will provide additional liquidity. This combined with our existing strong capital structure provides us with the ability to continue to invest in the business, return capital to shareholders and meet the cash flow needs related to ongoing legal matters. Now please turn to Slide 10 for a discussion on our business group performance. Starting with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.7 billion, down 3.9% organically. The expected decline in demand for disposable respirators was a headwind of approximately $50 million negatively impacting segment organic growth by 160 basis points. Organic growth was led by a double-digit increase in roofing granules, while industrial adhesives and tapes was flat, while all other businesses declined. Geographically, core industrial markets in the United States were relatively strong, while China remained weak. Our businesses were impacted by reduction in channel inventory towards the end of the quarter, particularly in the Greater China and EMEA regions, as channel partners manage cash and are cautious as we enter 2024. Adjusted operating income was $524 million, down 6% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 19.7%, down 70 basis points year-on-year. This decline was driven by lower sales volumes which was partially offset by benefits from restructuring, pricing and strong spending discipline. Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which posted sales of $1.8 billion or up 2.7% organically. Our auto OEM business continued to perform well and increased 13% versus a 9% increase in global car and light truck bills. The Electronics business was flat organically year-on-year as demand for consumer electronic devices began to stabilize, while semiconductor remains soft. We continue to closely monitor these trends and are well-positioned to grow with our customers in these large and important end markets. Looking at the rest of Transportation and Electronics, Advanced Materials grew organically high single-digits, Commercial Solutions grew low-single-digits and Transportation Safety declined \u2013single-digits. Transportation and Electronics delivered $370 million in adjusted operating income, up 28% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 20.9%, up 380 basis points versus Q4 last year. The team achieved this result through restructuring actions, pricing and strong spending discipline. Turning to our Health Care business. Q4 sales were $2 billion or down 1% organically versus last year. Sales in our Medical Solutions business grew low-single-digits organically, while Separation and Purification and Oral Care were both down low-single-digits. Health Information Systems organic sales decreased high-single-digits. Looking at the year, our businesses within Health Care continued to see lingering COVID related impacts. Full year organic growth in Health Care was approximately 1% with both Medical Solutions and Oral Care posting positive low-single-digit growth, while Health Information Systems and Separation and Purification were both down low-single-digits. Health Care's fourth quarter operating income was $372 million down 10% year-on-year. Operating margins were 18.3% or down 1.9 percentage points with adjusted EBITDA margins of 26%. Year-on-year adjusted operating margins were impacted by lower sales volumes along with added costs associated with the pending spin. Lastly, the Consumer business posted fourth quarter sales of $1.2 billion. Organic sales declined 2.2% year-on-year. Home improvement increased low-single-digits organically, while Home Health and Auto declined low-single-digits and Stationery and Office declined high-single-digits. Geographically, organic growth was down slightly in the U.S., while EMEA was down mid-single-digits and Asia Pacific declined low-double-digits. Consumer's fourth quarter operating income was $221 million, up 4% compared to last year. With operating margins of 18%, up 100 basis points year-on-year. The improvement in operating margins was driven by benefits from restructuring actions, portfolio optimization, strong spending discipline and productivity actions. Before I turn it back to Mike for him to discuss outlook for 2024, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on our 2023 total company performance. As the year progressed, we made strong improvements in adjusted operating margins. For reference, Slide 23 in the appendix provides our quarterly adjusted operating margin recon for the year. As you can see, we delivered significant improvement in performance, particularly when setting aside the impact from restructuring charges. Please turn to Slide 12, and I will now turn the call back over to Mike. Mike?\nMike Roman : Thank you, Monish. We are entering 2024 with strong momentum from our strategic priorities as we build on the actions taken in 2023. We will remain focused on improving operational performance as we progress our restructuring, while driving even greater supply chain productivity and inventory reductions. These represent significant opportunities to deliver sustainable margin and cash flow expansion in 2024. We will also further accelerate efforts to optimize our portfolio, which has been an ongoing strategy for 3M. In addition to finalizing the Health Care spin, we will continue implementing our geographic prioritization strategy. We will also step up our efforts to prioritize our product portfolios based on market potential, right to win, supply chain complexity, margins and returns. For example, in our Consumer business, we have identified approximately 5% of the portfolio where we have limited market growth and a poor right to win. While exiting these portfolios will impact consumers' growth rate in the near-term, these actions will better focus our efforts on products that best utilize 3M invention and ultimately drive improved growth and margins in the long-term. At the same time, 3M succeeds across market cycles because we remain close to customers and invest in innovation. We will continue to invest in R&D and capital expenditures, enabling us to win in our core and also in new attractive markets where 3M can make a difference. Finally, we will stay focused on reducing risk and uncertainty by proactively and effectively managing litigation, including finalizing legal settlements. We will advance the ramp down of PFAS manufacturing while continuing to make progress on our sustainability goals. In 2024, for example, we expect to complete the investments in state-of-the-art water filtration technology across our chemical manufacturing sites. Please turn to Slide 13. Based on these focus areas, along with the macroeconomic outlook, we are laying out our guidance for 2024. We expect the execution of our priorities to support the strengthening of our competitive position, continued underlying margin improvement and strong cash flows as we aggressively manage working capital. As we start 2024, the macro environment remains muted, similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, we anticipate organic full year growth of flat to plus 2%. Excluding the impact from geographic prioritization and portfolio actions, we expect organic growth of 1% to 3%. With respect to EPS, we anticipate earnings of $9.35 to $9.75 per share. We expect continued strong margin expansion, along with another year of strong cash flow with an adjusted conversion rate of 95% to 105%. As Bruce noted, following the completion of the Health Care spin, we will host an investor meeting and provide strategic updates along with updated guidance for 3M. As always, underpinning our success will be the strengths of 3M, our industry-leading material science, advanced manufacturing, global capabilities and iconic brands, along with some of the best and brightest people around the world. Before I turn it back to Monish, let me repeat a few important points. As I look across 3M, a 2023 was a pivotal year for our enterprise. We executed our plans and delivered on our commitment to exit the year stronger, leaner and more focused. We improved our operational performance advance the spin-off of Solventum and address risk and uncertainty. I am proud of everything we accomplished in 2023, and equally excited about the year ahead. We are in excellent position to build on our progress, continue to improve our operational performance and deliver another successful year. I thank all 3Mers for their dedication and for everything they do for our company. I will now turn it over to Monish for more details on our guidance. Monish?\nMonish Patolawala: Thanks, Mike. Please turn to Slide 14. As Mike highlighted, we expect another year of strong execution on our priorities, including strengthening our competitive position, continued margin improvement and robust cash flows as we aggressively manage working capital. Let's now look at our 2024 expected performance for our business segments. Starting with Safety and Industrial, where we estimate organic sales growth to be flat to up low-single-digits. As we start the year, we continue to see demand in industrial end markets remaining mixed. Full year 2024, industrial production forecast is currently expected to be at approximately 2% worldwide with the U.S. being flat. This business is not only impacted by general industrial manufacturing but also production activity in automotive and electronics end markets, which I will cover next with my comments on transportation and electronics. Adjusted organic sales growth for Transportation and Electronics is forecasted to be flat to up low-single-digits organically. This range excludes the impact of the exit of PFAS manufacturing. Consumer electronics end markets are expected to be up slightly year-on-year as the market works to turn the corner. The semiconductor market is forecasted to start the year soft, however, improve as we progress through the year. Automotive unit volume production is forecast to be down slightly year-on-year. Despite this forecast, we continue to see significant opportunities in the automotive sector through our offerings in both electric vehicle and internal combustion engine vehicles. Health Care's organic sales growth is anticipated to be flat to up low-single-digits year-on-year. Bryan and his team are excited to lead this great business and we'll be providing more details on 2024 and beyond, as we progress towards the spin. Turning to Consumer. Organic sales are expected to be down low-single-digits as discretionary spending is expected to remain muted, especially in the U.S., along with our ongoing portfolio optimization initiatives. As Mike mentioned, these actions are estimated to create a year-on-year organic growth headwind of approximately $100 million or 2 percentage points. As you create your models for 2024, I want to highlight some important items. We anticipate pre-tax restructuring charges in the range of $250 million to $350 million and incremental savings in the range of $150 million to $250 million. As I've previously mentioned, our savings are net of the necessary costs required to provide sustained benefits from our restructuring. For example, this includes structure necessary to enhance our go-to-market models, automate processes and continued investment in cybersecurity. Additionally, the restructuring actions have helped to partially reduce stranded costs associated with the pending spin of Health Care. Overall, our restructuring program remains on-track to deliver pretax savings in the range of $700 million to $900 million with a similar level of charges upon completion. We anticipate our actions will be largely done by the end of 2024, with benefits carrying into 2025. Moving to pension expense. We estimate a non-operating pension headwind of approximately $100 million in 2024 or a negative $0.15 per share. This headwind is primarily due to the updating of assumptions, including mortality, along with the amortization of prior period losses. While we will have an earnings headwind in 2024, it is important to note that our global plans are well funded, ending 2023 at 94%. Net interest expense is anticipated to be a small year-on-year benefit of approximately $0.03 per share. Again, this excludes the pending impact of the Health Care spin and legal settlements that Bruce mentioned at the start of the call. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be between 18.5% and 19.5% for 2024. This compares to our adjusted tax rate of 17.5% in 2023, resulting in a year-on-year headwind of approximately $0.17 per share at the midpoint. Therefore, the net impact of these below-the-line items is forecasted to result in an earnings headwind of approximately $0.29 per share. This combined headwind is included in our full year 2024 adjusted earnings range guidance of $9.35 to $9.75 that Mike mentioned. Please turn to Slide 15. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly cover our thoughts on the first quarter. As we look at the first quarter, we see our adjusted sales being approximately $7.6 billion or down slightly versus last year. This forecast factors in an expectation for similar macroeconomic trends that we saw in Q4. It also includes an approximate $100 million year-on-year sales headwind from geographic prioritization and consumer portfolio initiatives, along with the impact of last year's disposable respirator comp. Turning to earnings. We expect first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2 to $2.15 per share. This expectation reflects adjusted operating margins in the range of 19.5% to 20%. This range includes continued standup costs related to this pending spin of Health Care, along with over 100 basis points impact from restructuring and related charges. Excluding restructuring charges, adjusted operating margins are forecasted to increase by over 250 basis points year-on-year. In the first quarter, non-op pension will be a $0.04 per share headwind to adjusted earnings. And finally, we expect our adjusted tax rate in the first quarter to be in the range of 20% to 21%. In closing, I would like to emphasize a few things. We remain focused on our priorities and the team continues to drive results through strong operational execution. Our decisive actions in 2023 set the foundation for a strong 2024. As you know, there are many important milestones in the coming months, including completing the spin of Health Care. And finally, as a reminder, if you are creating financial models for 3M post-spin, please keep in mind that simply removing the Health Care business from Total 3M financials will not equal 3M post-spin. There are other factors such as transition service agreements, stranded costs and below-the-line changes that need to be taken into account. As mentioned, once the spin is complete, we will hold an investor meeting and provide an update on our outlook for 2024 that incorporates these factors. In summary, we are building on our momentum and driving sustainable operating improvements that will drive improved financial performance. I want to thank the 3M team for their dedication and focus, as they continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders. That concludes my remarks. We will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone. Mike and Monish, could you give us a little more color into the consumer and industrial channels that you deal with? I know you said you're seeing signs of consumer electronics improvement, but also mentioned the destock in China, for instance, at the end of Q4. Maybe you could elaborate on what you're seeing across the consumer and industrial channels. And then you are modeling Q1 sales, I think, to be sequentially flat, excluding the $100 million of sales headwind you called out, which seems conservative if your early cycle business starting to turn. So what are you seeing?\nMike Roman: Yes, Andy, I'd start with Q1 looks to us a lot like Q4. So some of the dynamics that you're asking about are part of that. We talked about electronics stabilizing in Q4. So starting year-over-year comparison and stabilizing against that. As we look forward, consumer retail, similar as well. We saw still softness in discretionary product categories, discretionary purchases. Consumer spending has been strong, but it's been shifting all through the year, as you know, to experiences, services and even food as inflation has impacted that. So we see that dynamic continuing to play out as we look forward. If you look at the channel, I'd say broadly, the channels are stabilizing. Consumer, there was -- as we went through the first part of last year, there was aggressive reduction in inventory in the channel. That played out and it's more balanced as we come through fourth quarter as we look into Q1. There was some cautious at the end of '23. At the end of the fourth quarter, we saw some caution in the channel in China and consumer. But I think they're fairly well balanced at this point. The one area where we continue to note some adjustments is in the industrial channels, and that's as supply chains continue to perform better, they're reducing their safety stock. And that's been a steady. I think there's a little bit of caution as we go into the New Year in areas like Europe, Middle East, Africa, there's a caution about demand. China, as I already said. So -- but I think generally broader, I would characterize it as more stable and in line with what the expectations are.\nMonish Patolawala: I just would add, Andy, to Mike's comments that auto builds are expected to be down 10% sequentially. And then historically, if you just look at a couple of our businesses is Consumer and Health Care, they seasonally do come down Q4 to Q1. So we baked all that into the guide that we've given of approximately $7.6 billion.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: That's helpful, guys. And then, Monish, could you give us a little more color in terms of what's happening with your restructuring program? You pretty much were matching benefits to cost in '23. And as you said, you even pulled forward a few pennies of restructuring versus your expectations in Q4. For '24, I think you're modeling now $100 million difference in terms of higher restructuring costs versus benefits. So maybe give us more color into why you can't get that sort of one-to-one faster return on your '24 actions?\nMonish Patolawala: No, I think -- Andy, let me explain that first. I'll just go all the way to the top again on our benefits and then I explain the math to you. So for everyone's benefit, in 2023, we implemented the most significant restructuring in our history that generated $400 million in savings last year and approximately the same amount in costs. But when you look at the overall program, it remains on track to achieve the annual run rates of $700 million to $900 million upon completion. And assuming a no-spin scenario of Health Care, as Bruce mentioned earlier, we expect nearly 200 to 300 basis points of margin improvement to be realized upon completion of the whole program. And the program, as you said, Andy, remains on track. We've said that it remains on track, and we did pull in or accelerated some of our restructuring into 2023 based on the success that we have had in the program. What I would tell you to answer your question specifically is what I've said is the $150 million to $250 million is incremental benefit. So on a cumulative basis, if you did $400 million in 2023, and you say midpoint of $150 million to $200 million, that's cumulative $600 million. So on a year-over-year, that's incremental $200 million. While on a cost basis, we said we incurred $400 million and change in the fourth quarter, I think, it\u2019s $441 million. And I said we'll have $250 million to $350 million of cost. So on a cumulative basis, the cost will be around $750 million again at the midpoint. As I've also said in my prepared remarks, we believe this program will be largely completed by the end of 2024 from an expense perspective and the benefits will continue into 2025 and beyond. I just want to make sure 1 other thing, and we think about restructuring, I just want us to also think through this is -- and I want you all to know, this is how we work. And this is not a series of one-time actions. And I know a lot of investors have asked us, show us the break between benefits and costs. So we are definitely trying to do that the best we can. In 2023, it made all the sense because these were new actions, it was good to show it as individual. But as it becomes the way we work, my request to all of you is focus on the total margin of the company, which is demonstrated in 2024, where our guide is saying we'll improve margins, another 75 to 100 basis points in total. So, for example, and the reason I bring this up is you have to look at all of this in totality. For example, we announced that we were going to change our distribution model in 27 countries. The savings of the rooftops, the head count is shown as a benefit in our restructuring program. But as you all know, there's a corresponding impact on the revenue, and the action has to be looked at in totality versus standalone events. And I just want to make sure we bring that out, too. But we'll continue showing what it helps you all, and that's what we have tried to do with this go-round. So hopefully, I cleared that question, Andy, that you had.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Guys, can you help us understand the ebb and flow when you go to an export model for 30 countries and -- maybe help us understand the materiality of that, it could be 30 really small countries, could be a mix, I don't know. But if you think about kind of the revenue headwind versus the cost tailwind, is it -- is there some numbers we can talk around or any perhaps even some color on how that ebbs and flows?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So Scott, the total impact of geographic prioritization and portfolio actions that Mike mentioned is around 100 basis points for the company. Of that, 60% is product portfolio optimization. The balance is geographic prioritization. And overall, when you look at the margin rate in these smaller countries, they were at lower margins than the average for 3M. So that's when you refocus, what happens is, since you're going through a distributor, you basically have to drop price to some extent because now they're picking up your cost. And so that's why you see the revenue headwind. But on a margin rate perspective, this is beneficial for us to do. It helps us focus on the bigger countries. It also allows us to reinvest in those bigger countries, while at the same time, making sure that in the smaller countries where we are changing the model, we can continue to serve those customers well with what we would call internally as an export-led model, which is we're going to ship our product out from the United States or wherever our end manufacturing is into those countries. So we are still taking care of the customers. We're just following a more efficient way to transact with those customers. So hopefully, that answers, Scott.\nScott Davis: I think it does. And just separately, working capital has been a real source of benefit for you folks and particularly in '23. But are we -- as an entity, are you learning to run at lower working capital levels? And more specifically, really, what I'm talking about is inventory. And I think historically just having covered you guys for a while, inventory levels kind of went up and down based on demand, you're not expecting much demand in '24. So explicitly, I suppose that means you can run at lower inventory levels. But if demand were to start to snap back at better levels than you're expecting, would you still be able to run at relatively low inventory levels? Have there been enough structural change, I guess, is what I'm asking to 3M where you can run more productively and efficiently from a working capital perspective?\nMonish Patolawala: I would say so, Scott, as the team has done, Peter and the supply chain team have done a great job. One is learning through the pandemic on how do you manage the ebbs and flows as you go through supply chain disruptions. Two is we have spent a lot of time and energy investing in digital resources that allow us to more efficiently look at demand plans, look at where our inventory is and we have continued to keep working on dual sourcing, et cetera, that helps us get alternate sources of supply whenever you could have a disruption in one place. My view is this inventory still has ways to run using data and data analytics. We can keep reducing inventory. Working capital is going to continue to be a source of 3M's cash generation machine, along with a good EBITDA that we generate. And at the same time, I would tell you that volume -- if you see volume come back up, the factories are ready and we have the capacity and we'll act accordingly. So I would say the team has done a really nice job, but there's always more we can do and we'll keep doing.\nMike Roman: Scott, just to add, the actions that we have been talking about all through '23, the actions to streamline our supply chain operations, simplify our go-to-market model, that streamlining supply chain operations. It was more than a restructuring. This was about aligning our global supply chains to our go-to-market models, really optimizing what we do across plan, source, make, deliver, with a focus on -- and an expectation that we're going to drive improvements, improvements in service, improvements in costs, improvements in working capital and cash. Monish said earlier, it's the actions we've taken about the way we operate, and it's an expectation we're going to continue to improve our execution. So there's a plan and strategy in data and data analytics gives us a basis for driving better visibility and improvement as well. So it's a -- it is part of that. So we do expect to continue to drive improvement as we our guide for '24 has us, again, driving improvements in how we execute showing up in growth in earnings and expanded margins and another year of strong cash generation. So it's a -- it is an important part of that -- those actions that we took as we went through '23.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Maybe first off, I just wanted to clarify some of Monish's comments on operating margins year-on-year. So I think Monish, you were saying that in Q1, the margin is up 250 bps, excluding restructuring. And then the full year is up 75 to 100 bps including restructure. I just want to make sure if those numbers were right.\nMonish Patolawala: You're right. You're right.\nJulian Mitchell: Any color on sort of segments within that or the corporate cost, there was some reallocation you talked about on Slide 7? Any kind of major moving parts that you'd call out year-on-year on a segment basis or what that new sort of corporate run rate is?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. I would say, Julian, as with prior years, there are a number of miscellaneous items in corporate and unallocated that are always subject to a fluctuation on a quarterly annual basis. So if you look at 2023, our input cost was $44 million. And in the fourth quarter, it was a $120 million benefit. The Q4 benefit was largely the result of annual incentive compensation accrual for the first nine months that we allocated the businesses finally based on performance. This adjustment had no impact to total company margins. So it's just a bucket swap between corporate unallocated and the businesses. And so for the full year of 2024, again, based on Health Care, being a part of 3M for the whole year. So it's just the assumption, we expect the expense range of paying somewhere in the $100 million to the $200 million on an adjusted basis for corporate unallocated.\nJulian Mitchell: And then just my second question, just trying to understand the free cash flow guidance because I think you did $6.3 billion of free cash in 2023. And this year is guided at about $5.3 billion. So it's a big decline year-on-year even with net income, I think, growing $200 million in the guide and CapEx is up about $100 million in the guide. Anything to sort of call out on that?\nMonish Patolawala: I would just say, Julian, 3M has historically always been a good cash generator. And that's what we plan to continue doing. If you look at 2022, we had 86% of free cash flow conversion, which we were not happy with at all. And the teams have done a great job in 2023 to get us back. If you take the two years, it's around 100%. And if you look at the history of 3M, we have always been in that range. And I would say we'll continue doing that. But at the same time, we'll keep investing in growth, productivity and sustainability as and when the volume comes up as and when the opportunities arise because at the end of the day, our first priority is organic growth because that gives us the best return. And the best way to do that is organic investment. So that's our first priority.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Great [Indiscernible] by the way. So I just want to dig into the corporate line again, Monish. I think you said $100 million to $200 million kind of a run rate for 2024. That's EBIT, not EBITDA. I just want to make sure that's the case. And are you reflecting any corporate dissynergies or stand-alone cost for Health Care within that $100 million to $200 million?\nMonish Patolawala: It's EBIT. It's EBIT, Nigel, so that -- can you hear me?\nNigel Coe: Yes, I can hear. Yes.\nMonish Patolawala: I'm sorry, what was your follow-up question? I didn't catch the...\nNigel Coe: Yes. The kind of -- the second part of that question was were -- are you reflecting any stand-alone costs or stand-alone costs or corporate synergies from the Health Care spend within that number? Or would that be additive to that range?\nMonish Patolawala: No. That number, again, if you just go back to Bruce's comment at the beginning of the call, our current assumption is that Health Care is a part of 3M, even though the spin is on-track for first half 2024. And as we go through the spin of Health Care, we plan to have an Investor Day post-spin, where we'll update you on the stranded cost, the impact of transition services agreements as well as what 3M looks post-spin.\nBruce Jermeland: Yes. Nigel, just to highlight, Monish during his prepared remarks, did mention that there is additional cost in Health Care for standing it up as a stand-alone entity. So that is having some margin impact within Health Care.\nNigel Coe: No question. I just want to make sure that was the case. And then my follow-up question is just really trying to dig into the restructuring cadence. You obviously -- you quantified the Q1 impact, but take the $152 million of cost savings in Q4, Monish, and then multiply that 4. You get to mathematically about $650 million of cost savings. And the midpoint of your guide for 2024 is $617 million. So I'm just actually wondering, it doesn't look like we're getting any incremental costs coming through from here on in 2024. So just wondering what is the offset to that? Is there some level of investment here? Just wondering what's going on here?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So I would say it's the same thing I've said before. If you remember, we have said our total benefits of $700 million to $900 million, once the program is done with equal costs. We are saying though, our actions will be largely done at the end of 2024. So you will see benefits continuing into 2025. And as I've previously mentioned, our savings are net of the necessary investments required to provide sustained benefits from our restructuring programs. So for example, -- these investments include structure necessary to enhance our go-to-market models. As we talked about, we have exited or changed the distribution model for 27 to 30 countries. So making sure we have a structure that supports that change, continuing to automate our back-end processes as we continue with the spin of Health Care upgrade rooftops as we consolidate space because you see the savings as we have exited the space, but I got to make sure that the rooftops upgraded so people can come into work there and then continued investment in cybersecurity. And we have also said this before that the restructuring actions that we have taken, one, it's a way of how we work, but two, it will help us partially reduce the stranded costs associated with the pending spin of Health Care. So all put together, I still see the programs on-track at $700 million to $900 million. But as I mentioned before, too, I would just ask you all to think through, there's a side of cost cadence, which once we are done with those actions, those cost cadence will go away and the benefits will continue into 2025 and beyond at an annualized basis of $700 million, $900 million, assuming Health Care remains as a part of 3M.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS.\nChristopher Snyder: I also wanted to ask on 2024 margins. And if we look through the restructuring, it seems like the guide is implying flat margins year-on-year from the business. And I guess, why isn't there expected margin expansion because the company is expecting to grow volumes or at least grow organically in the year. And it sounds like some of the exits the company is making should be accretive for margins of the underlying business. Just what are some of the headwinds there?\nMonish Patolawala: So I would say exactly the same thing I said before. When you look at it in total, our plan for 2024 assumes a margin expansion of 75 to 100 basis points, which includes a piece -- which includes the restructuring benefits and the lower restructuring costs. But at the same time, it also includes many other factors that we take into. For example, we're going to continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability as the macro starts improving. We're going to continue to invest in product areas. We're going to continue to invest in our people. So I would again ask you to look at in total, if you exclude restructuring costs in 2023, we expanded margins 60 basis points. And in 2024, our total margin expansion, including the benefits of restructuring is 75 to 100 basis points. So Chris, I would say as the year progresses, and I've said this before, volume gives us the best leverage. So as we get more volume, we're going to continue to see leverage increase.\nChristopher Snyder: I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up on the margins. I know you guys said $150 million to $250 million year-on-year net restructuring for the full year. But could you tell us what is implied in the Q1 guidance? And then also, I believe you said that the margin -- the Q1 margin includes some level of standing up cost for Health Care. Could you just tell us what those are expected to come in at?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So the benefits, I would say, again, it depends on which way you're looking at it, Chris. I would tell you, on a year-over-year basis, as I said, there's approximately 75 to 100 basis points -- sorry, $75 million to $100 million of restructuring cost on a year-over-year basis. So if you exclude that margin rates are 19.5% to 20% for Q1. No, sorry, 19.5% -- my number is all getting. It's 19.5% to 20% is the guide, which includes $75 million to $100 million of cost. So if you adjust for that cost on a year-over-year basis, margin rates will be up 250 to 300 basis points. And then on standup costs, again, timing will determine what the final standup cost is. But currently, we see approximately $0.07 to $0.08 of total cost that we are incurring, as Bryan and the team get ready for spin of Health Care.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nJoseph Ritchie: Good morning, everyone. Just -- so obviously, like the volume environment remains fairly muted. But I'm curious like how are you guys thinking about pricing for '24 and particularly like what's embedded in the guide from a price cost standpoint?\nMonish Patolawala: So 2024 outlook assumes we will have selling prices year-on-year. It's helping us offset some of the moderate inflation we are seeing in certain raw materials, and then the labor market continues to remain strong. But I would just tell you, you have seen we've become good at monitoring this. We'll make sure we continue to take actions as needed. And you've seen it, we've done that in '22. We have done that in 2023. But I would say, more importantly, when you think about margin rate, and the supply chain teams and the business teams, we are not just taking price raw as one item. In total, we are just saying how do we improve margins. So a lot of actions has been taken on, whether it's through selling price increases, driving global sourcing benefits, dual sourcing, driving yield in the factories and of course, prioritizing demand. And all of that put together, including the new way we work with all the restructuring-related items we have announced last year just help us continue to drive margin between 2024, '25 and beyond.\nJoseph Ritchie: Got it. That's clear, Monish. I guess there's been a lot of discussion on the restructuring expenses and the benefits coming through in the next couple of years. I guess just for 2025, as we're thinking about the low-end versus the high-end of the benefits range. Maybe like how would you kind of handicap what are the key drivers that potentially puts you guys at the low-end of the in versus the high-end of the $900 million benefit range?\nMonish Patolawala: So I would first say, number one, again, I keep reiterating this just because there's an assumption that's out there that we have assumed that Health Care remains as a part of 3M. That's just the guide but Health Care is on track for a first half '24 spin. Keeping that in mind, when you think about $700 million to $900 million, it's driven by two pieces. One is the pace at which we can execute some of these actions as well as some of the rooftop consolidations that we are working on. In total, I still feel good that the range of $700 million to $900 million is good for the overall program. But as you have seen, Joe, quarter-to-quarter, there's always going to be a little movement because there are multiple actions that we're working through regulations in countries and we're working through making sure we are doing it in a safe manner that you could have a month or two delay. But overall, I still feel good $700 million to $900 million is a good range.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan.\nStephen Tusa: I'm still not 100% clear what the sequential decline is in EPS from 4Q to 1Q. Can you maybe just help bridge that a little more specifically? I know there's tax impact there, maybe a little bit of sequential sales decline. I'm just having a little bit of a hard time reconciling the walks. I mean I think you had a $0.07 charge in Forex from Argentine devaluation, maybe that's a factor. I don't know, just maybe a little more color on the sequential EPS bridge from 4Q to 1Q.\nMonish Patolawala: Sure. And Steve, as I said, as you start lapping quarters and the benefits of restructuring starts showing up in the results, it's going to get harder and harder to do sequentials. But anyway, I'll do my best, and hopefully, that answers your question. So I would start by first saying you're going to see another strong quarter of execution on a year-over-year basis, and I would ask you to look at that first. When you look at our guide for January, we're saying it's approximately $7.6 billion. And there are no surprises in January so far. It's very similar to Q4 trends. So volume is a little lower Q4 to Q1. That has an impact. Secondly, there is usual seasonality that we see in our business when it comes to resetting some of our pay plans and some of the other compensation things that we do. So seasonally, you see that as an impact. Third is, as I mentioned earlier, we are incurring incremental costs to stand up the Health Care business as we get ready for the spin. The total impact is approximately $0.07 to $0.08 is the total impact of the -- it's the total cost in the quarter. We have a headwind from our pension accounting that we talked about, which is $0.04 of headwind. And then from a tax rate basis, we expect our 1Q tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21% versus we ended the fourth quarter at 14.9%. So I hope that kind of gives you all the puts and takes to get you to the range that we have of $2 to $2.15.\nStephen Tusa: Yes, that makes sense. And then just one last thing on restructuring. I mean, I don't -- I usually think of restructuring as building once you do a certain number in a quarter, you kind of carry it over annually, you guys are run rating at a pretty high level of benefits in the third and the fourth quarter that ramped pretty hard sequentially from the first half. Is there any like seasonality to these cost saves? Or I'm just curious as to why they're not maybe carrying over a little more into the first half of '24, like of a compounding of those benefits, if you will. I can understand the expense numbers are very clear, but it seems like you're kind of under punching the benefits based on that carryover in '24, especially in the first half.\nMonish Patolawala: I'm not sure I -- one would agree with that. But when you look at 1Q of '23 versus 1Q of '24. There was no restructuring benefits pretty much in 1Q of '23, and we had a little bit of cost in '23. So if you look at 1Q versus 1Q, you actually see margin rates up 250 basis points, excluding the impact of restructuring costs. So you are seeing the benefits, Steve, on a year-over-year basis in 1Q. For the year, as we have previously mentioned, our savings that we are showing you in the $700 million, $900 million, which it always has been, are net of the necessary investments that we are required to provide, which we are going to spend to provide sustained benefits. So again, just to repeat, things like, we changed our method of delivery in certain geographies, 30 countries. You need a structure that has to get put into place to serve that. You've got rooftops. So we have exited the rooftops, you're starting to see the savings, but we have to spend the money to upgrade the rooftops that we are left because we have to consolidate that space so that people can come and work in that space. And then we'll continue to invest in things like, customer operations and automate customer operations, which was a part of the whole -- there was a reason why we did this. Mike said it, I've said it, it's the way we work and some of the savings you're seeing come ahead as you've made those actions. And now we're going to put it -- we're going to put in the necessary costs so that we can continue to see those savings. And that's why I keep saying at the end of 2024, we'll be largely done with these actions and the benefits will carry on into '25 and beyond at $700 million to $900 million.\nBruce Jermeland : Yes. Just so it's clear, Steve, the investments that Monish is highlighting is included.\nMonish Patolawala: In the $700 million.\nBruce Jermeland : In the $700 million, $900 million.\nStephen Tusa: Yes. Okay. That all makes sense. So it's kind of a bit of a timing thing.\nBruce Jermeland: Correct.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I just want to come back just to thinking about kind of the separation and just some of the math. Monish, you have taken some pains here to kind of remind us that it's not as simple as just splitting this in two. So just a couple of questions. I think you had previously said that just kind of stand-alone corporate costs for the Health Care business was about $100 million. I wonder if that's moving around at all if you could provide any additional color on that? And is there some color you could provide on what you're expecting on the TSAs think that's going to have to be an input to what the EBITDA is for Health Care at the time of the spin and the associated dividend that comes off that. So I know when to get the 4 and 10s to get a little bit closer. You're going to be more precise on this, but it does seem like you're directionally warning us to be prepared for some friction here. So I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit more color.\nMonish Patolawala: Yes, Jeff, as we said, I think the timing of the spin will definitely determine some of these costs. And I would just say let us work through it. As we get closer to it, Bryan and the team will walk you through as they get closer to getting ready for the spin. And as committed, we are going to have an Investor Day post-spin while we'll walk you through all the factors that you have to take into account, which is not only post 3M, what does that revenue and margin look like, but also the impact of transition services agreements because they will be transition services agreements for a period of time and then the amount of stranded costs. The good news, Jeff, is that through all the restructuring actions that we have done, to some extent, we have been able to reduce the amount of standard cost that would have been there if we hadn't taken these actions to reduce some of the cost at the center.\nJeffrey Sprague: And then unrelated, just on Slide 3. Have you definitively decided to use the $1 billion equity option to fund part of Combat Arms?\nMonish Patolawala: Have we decided, I'm sorry?\nJeffrey Sprague: Have you decided to go ahead and use the equity option of $1 billion for the Combat Arms?\nMonish Patolawala: No, we have not, Jeff. That's an option we hold, and we will make the appropriate decision once -- we see the progress in the number of opt-ins for the Combat Arms litigation.\nBruce Jermeland : Yes, Jeff, the purpose of our statement is, so you guys can think about your outstanding share count that if we do exercise that option to pay in equity that, that will be treated as an excludes item in arriving at adjusted results. So that was only just to highlight, don't worry about the impact it is at our option. That is yet to be determined, but you don't have to take that into account relative to your share count on an adjusted basis.\nJeffrey Sprague: But it sounds like you then will be planning to use an adjusted share count if you go down this path, right? So we're kind of compounding adjustments on top of adjustments, it sounds like.\nBruce Jermeland: There would be a difference in GAAP shares outstanding versus adjusted shares outstanding if we decide to exercise this option to issue equity. Yes, we'll make it clear in our financial reporting if that were to incur.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Just had a couple of questions on some of the outliers in the fourth quarter results. And hopefully, I didn't miss this -- for transportation, electronics, significant upside on the top line. I saw that you have an adjusted flat organic revenue growth. So what were those adjustments that were to the good -- and then on the corporate line, and it's one, two a significant benefit -- just give us a sense of what those adjustments were that would have caused that? And maybe you answered that question with Julian, but I just wanted to get those clarified, please.\nMike Roman: Yes, Deane, I think what you're looking at is the adjustment for PFAS, the exit of PFAS. If you recall, we're excluding the PFAS related men -- the PFAS manufacturing and related business as we report. And that was part -- the primary business for that was transportation and electronics. So that's where you saw that, maybe that adjustment.\nDeane Dray: That's helpful. And how about the corporate line?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So as with previous years, Deane, there are a number of miscellaneous items at corporate and unallocated that are subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis. So if you answer specifically your question, if you look at for the year, corporate and unallocated was $44 million and on a -- and in the fourth quarter, it was a benefit of $121 million. The Q4 benefit was largely the result of annual incentive compensation accrual for the first nine months that has now been allocated back to the business segments based on final performance. This adjustment had no impact to total company margins because it's a move from corporate and unallocated to the business segment. And then for the full year 2024, we expect the expense range to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million on an adjusted basis.\nDeane Dray: Great. I appreciate that. And just one last follow-up for me, Mike. You talked about the goals for '24 related to PFAS to advance the ramp down. Would there -- from what you see today, would there be any circumstances where 3M would continue to produce PFAS after 2025? Or is this just a non-negotiable? And will you dismantle the equipment? Or can it be repurposed?\nMike Roman: Yes, Deane, we're committed to that what we announced to exit PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. And as I said, we're making good progress to that. We're working to help customers transition. We will -- I think we talked about this on one of our earnings calls, we will not sell the equipment, we won't transfer any of the assets. We won't sell the business. We won't license our intellectual property. So we are going to exit and complete by the end of 2025. That's everybody's focused on that goal.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.\nMike Roman: To wrap up, we are executing our priorities and delivering on our commitments. We will stay focused on continuing to improve our performance, optimize our portfolio and reduce risk, while using 3M science to create unique solutions for our customers. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the 3M Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, October 24, 2023. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland: Thank you and good morning, everyone and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our President and Chief Financia. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments, and then we will take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation acCompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website @3m.com. Please turn to Slide two. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note, throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release. With that, please turn to Slide three and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike?\nMichael Roman: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, we built momentum through strong operational execution as we again delivered for our customers, positioning us for a solid close to 2023. On an adjusted basis, we delivered earnings ahead of our expectations, expanded margins sequentially across all four businesses, and achieved our third consecutive quarter of double-digit year-on-year growth in free cash flow. As we make progress and deliver improved financial results, we are increasing our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $8.95 to $9.15, up from a previous range of $8.60 to $9.10, and our adjusted free cash flow conversion range to 100% to 110%, up from 90% to 100% previously. We continue to deliver against our priorities. We are driving performance throughout 3M with strong operational execution, restructuring actions, and spending discipline. We are progressing the spin of the healthcare business, which we expect to be completed during the first half of 2024. And we are reducing risk and uncertainty by reaching significant settlements to address combat arms and PFAS litigation. I will now provide some additional context around how we are advancing these priorities. Next slide, please. Our margin expansion clearly demonstrates the performance our team is driving throughout 3M. We delivered 240 basis points of year-over-year adjusted operating income margin expansion, excluding 80 basis points of restructuring-related charges. We are strengthening our business in several important ways. We are progressing with our restructuring actions to streamline our organization, reduce structural costs, and get us closer to customers. We have leaned out the center of our Company, simplified our global supply chain organization, and optimized our global go-to-market models. At the same time, we are advancing supply chain performance to improve service, drive productivity and yield, expand gross margins, and increase cash conversion. These results are being supported by initiatives that use our continuous improvement toolkit and leverage data and data analytics. For example, we have benefited from more than 60 Kaizen events this year to improve existing processes in our largest plants. We are also progressing the spin of our healthcare business, building the leadership team as we work toward completing the spin in the first half of 2024. During the quarter, we added two experienced leaders, naming Bryan Hanson as the CEO of the Standalone Healthcare Business and Kerry Cox as the Board Chair. Finally, we continue to manage risk and uncertainty by proactively and effectively managing litigation. We announced the combat arms settlement, and we are working with all parties and the courts to implement it. The settlement administration process has been established and funded. The bellwether trial verdicts have been settled, and the process for notifying and settling with claimants has begun. With respect to PFAS, the public water supplier settlement we announced last quarter has received preliminary court approval. We successfully resolved objections from state attorneys general and are working toward approval with the final hearing set for early February next year. In closing, I want to share a few thoughts about our future. Our momentum accelerates our ability to define where we go next at 3M. As we prioritize attractive markets, where we have the right to win, and the opportunity to differentiate ourselves through our unique capabilities and strengths; a good example is our automotive OEM business, where we continue to outperform the market with double-digit growth this quarter. Auto electrification is on track to be a $600 million business this year and has delivered organic growth of 30% year to date. Our material science expertise has led us to build a new business, and we see similar opportunities in other core platforms such as safety, home improvement, and consumer electronics. We are also prioritizing emerging global trends that have attractive growth rates and customer needs that match up well with 3M capabilities. We are building new platforms in areas like climate technology, industrial automation, and next-generation electronics. Before I hand it over to Monish for additional insight into our performance, a few closing thoughts. I am pleased with the way our teams are executing. They delivered third-quarter results that build on the momentum we saw in the second quarter, setting us up for a solid close to 2023. We are advancing our priorities, driving performance, progressing our healthcare spin, and reducing risk and uncertainty. 3M is delivering today lower costs, better margins, and greater cash generation and building for tomorrow, prioritizing growth platforms, innovating with impact, and empowering our teams. I will now turn it over to Monish for more details on the third quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Monish?\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to slide five. As Mike mentioned, we are seeing significant traction from the actions we are taking to strengthen the business. Through a focus on customers, effective adjustment of production, benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives, ongoing proactive spending discipline, and the relentless focus on managing inventory, we were able to deliver solid adjusted third-quarter results, including sales of $8 billion at the high-end of our guidance range of $7.9 billion to $8 billion, operating margins of 23.2%, an increase of 160 basis points year-on-year and 390 basis points sequentially; earnings per share of $2.68, a year-on-year increase of 3%, and free cash flow of $1.9 billion, up 39% year-on-year with conversion of 130%. Organic sales on an adjusted basis declined 3.1% versus last year. This included an expected year-on-year headwind of approximately $140 million, or 1.7 percentage points related to lower disposable respirator demand and last year's exit of our operations in Russia. Excluding this, Q3 adjusted organic sales were down 1.4%. Consumer and electronics end markets continue to be soft. Our adjusted organic sales declined year-on-year mid-single digits in our electronics business and high-single digits in consumer. This softness was partially offset by strength in our automotive OEM business. Regionally, the U.S. was up slightly despite continued challenges in retail. Europe remained soft, and China was down mid-teens year-on-year organically due to continued end-market softness along with lapping strong sales backlog recovery in the prior year. Our strong adjusted EPS of $2.68, exceeded our expectations of $2.25 to $2.40. Roughly two-thirds of the beat was driven by operational execution in our supply chain and proactive spending discipline, and a balance driven by restructuring timing. The restructuring actions we announced earlier this year are largely on track and we are seeing favorable margin impact in our results. We continue to expect full year pre-tax restructuring benefits of $400 million to $450 million with offsetting charges. Turning to slide six for the components that drove our year-on-year operating margin and earnings performance, manufacturing productivity and restructuring actions, strong spending discipline, and selling prices partially offset by lower sales volume, investments in the business, and the previously mentioned headwind from disposable respirator and last year's exit of Russia, resulted an improvement to operating margins of 260 basis points and to earnings of $0.22 per share. Pre-tax restructuring and related charges in the quarter were $68 million or a negative impact to margins of 80 basis points and $0.10 to earnings. This charge was lower than our anticipated range of $125 million to $175 million in Q3 due to factors that impacted the timing of actions that are being pushed into Q4. The carryover impact of higher raw material logistics and energy cost inflation created a year-on-year headwind of approximately $25 million, or a negative 30 basis points impact to operating margins and $0.03 to earnings. Foreign currency translation was a positive 0.6% impact to total adjusted sales. This resulted in a $0.01 tailwind to earnings per share. Last year's food safety divestiture and the reconsolidation of aero technologies resulted in a net year-on-year tailwind of 10 basis points to margins and no impact to earnings. Finally, other financial items decreased earnings by a net $0.02 per share year-on-year. In summary, our team's focus on driving productivity, executing restructuring actions, and controlling spending continues to yield results. These actions drove meaningful year-on-year and sequential improvement in adjusted operating margins. Please turn to slide seven. Third quarter adjusted free cash flow was $1.9 billion, up 39% year-on-year, with a conversion of 130%, up 360 basis points, versus last year's Q3. This year-on-year improvement was driven by an ongoing focus on working capital management, especially inventory. Inventory was down over $200 million sequentially and $550 million year-on-year as we benefit from the power of daily management and data and data analytics to speed up inventory terms. As always, there is more we can do and will do to continue to realize benefits from our actions as we move forward. Adjusted capital expenditures were $367 million in the quarter as we continue to invest in growth, productivity, and sustainability. During the quarter, we returned $828 million to shareholders via dividends. Net debt at the end of Q3 stood at $10.8 billion, a reduction of 11% year-on-year. Our business segments continue their long history of robust cash flow generation. In addition, our proven access to capital markets, along with the anticipated one-time dividend from the spin of health care at leverage of three to three and a half times EBITDA and 19.9% retained stake will provide additional financial flexibility. This, combined with our existing strong capital structure, provides us with the ability to continue to invest in the business, return capital to shareholders, and meet the cash flow needs related to ongoing legal matters. Now, please turn to slide nine for our business group performance. Starting with our safety and industrial business, which posted sales of $2.8 billion or down 5.8% organically, this result included a year-on-year headwind of approximately $130 million, or 4.3 percentage points, due to last year's COVID-related disposable respirator decline and exit of our operations in Russia. Excluding this, Q3 adjusted organic sales were down 1.5%. Personal safety was down high single digits due to last year's COVID-related disposable respirator comp. Excluding disposable respirators, personal safety was up high single digits organically. Closure and masking continued to be impacted by lower packaging and shipping activity, and industrial adhesive and tapes by end-market softness in electronics. Abrasives, electrical markets, and automotive aftermarket declined versus last year's strong comparisons. And finally, organic growth in our roofing granules business was up high single digits. Adjusted operating income was $708 million or up 5% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 25.7%, up 250 basis points year-on-year and up 350 basis points sequentially. The year-on-year improvement in margins was mainly driven by ongoing productivity actions, restructuring benefits, strong spending discipline and price. Partially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from lower sales volume and restructuring costs. Moving to Transportation and Electronics on Slide 10, which posted Q3 adjusted sales of $1.9 billion. Adjusted organic growth declined 1.8% year-on-year, largely due to expected weakness in electronics. Our electronics business experienced a year-on-year mid-single-digit decline in adjusted organic sales as semiconductor and data center end market demand continues to remain soft.  We are starting to see signs of stabilization in consumer electronics end market. However, we are closely monitoring demand trends as we head into the upcoming holiday season. Our auto OEM business had a strong quarter, increasing approximately 16% year-on-year versus a low single-digit global car and light truck build, as we continue to gain penetration on automotive platforms. Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics, commercial solutions and transportation safety both declined mid-single digits year-on-year, mainly driven by weakness in China, while Advanced Materials grew low single digits. Transportation and Electronics delivered $494 million in adjusted operating income, up 21% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 26.3%, up 460 basis points year-on-year and up 650 basis points sequentially. The year-on-year improvement in margins was driven by productivity actions, restructuring benefits, strong spending discipline and price. Partially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from lower sales volumes and restructuring costs. Looking at our health care business on Slide 11, Q3 sales were $2.1 billion, with organic growth up 2.4% versus last year. Organic sales in oral care were up high single digits year-on-year and medical solutions grew low single digits organically, including continued impact from lower post-COVID-related bio-pharma demand. Health Information Systems declined low single digits due to tighter hospital budgets. As procedure volumes continue to improve and hospital budgets stabilize, we are confident in the long-term outlook of this business. Health Care's third quarter operating income was $460 million or up 2% year-on-year. Operating margins were 22.2%, up 50 basis points year-on-year and up sequentially 240 basis points. The year-on-year improvement in margins was driven by productivity actions, restructuring benefits strong spending discipline and price. These benefits were partially offset by restructuring costs. Finally, on Slide 12, our Consumer business posted third quarter sales of $1.3 billion. Organic sales declined 7.2% year-on-year as discretionary spending trends on hard-line categories remains subdued. The back-to-school season was soft and rising interest rates continue to impact the housing market and related spending. Consumers' third quarter operating income was $269 million, down 10% compared to last year with operating margins of 20.5%, down 70 basis points year-on-year, however, were up 230 basis points sequentially. The year-on-year decline in margins was driven by headwinds from lower sales volumes and restructuring costs. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from productivity actions, restructuring and strong spending discipline and price. That concludes our remarks on the third quarter. Please turn to Slide 14 for an update on our full year's expectations. Our strong third quarter performance shows the results of the significant actions we have put in place this year to generate better productivity yield and efficiency from our supply chain, drive simplification, manage costs and deliver for our customers in an uncertain macro environment. As a result, we are raising our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow conversion guidance. We now expect full year adjusted earnings in the range of $8.95 to $9.15 versus our prior range of $8.60 to $9.10. We are also updating our full year adjusted free cash flow conversion to be in a forecasted range of 100% to 110% versus 90% to 100% previously. Based on our year-to-date performance, we expect full year adjusted organic growth to be down approximately 3% versus our prior guidance to be at the lower end of flat to minus 3%. This updated expectation includes an incremental headwind of $50 million from continued softness in disposable respirator demand. We now estimate a full year sales decline for disposable respirators of approximately $600 million versus $550 million previously. Looking ahead to the implied fourth quarter, we expect end market trends to be consistent with Q3. Hence, we anticipate fourth quarter adjusted sales to be in the range of $7.6 billion to $7.7 billion, taking into consideration normal seasonality with fewer sales days due to holidays. Fourth quarter pre-tax restructuring charges are expected to be in the range of $70 million to $120 million, incorporating the timing impact I mentioned earlier, with pre-tax benefits of $145 million to $195 million. Taken together, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $2.13 to $2.33. To wrap up, we are very focused on our priorities by driving improved performance through strong operational execution, progressing on our restructuring actions and spending discipline successfully spinning off health care and reducing risk by managing litigation exposures. At the same time, we are positioning 3M for the future as we prioritize the most attractive markets, invest to support continued innovation and capitalize on emerging opportunities. We expect our actions will continue to build momentum and drive long-term improvement in our organic growth margins and cash flow performance into the future. As we exit 2023, we will be a stronger, leaner and a more focused 3M, and I remain confident in our future. Our solid third quarter is a direct result of the hard work of 3M employees. I want to thank them for their dedication and focus as they continue to deliver in partnership with our suppliers for customers and shareholders. That concludes my remarks. We will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. You may proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Good morning, Mike, Monish, and Bruce. I haven't been able to say this in a while, but a pretty solid, complete quarter overall, so some progress there. But, guys, I want to back up a little bit. What are the remaining steps to get health care spin complete? Any big hurdles still remaining?\nMichael Roman: Yes, Scott, I would say the team continues to make very good progress. And so we don't see any hurdles ahead of us. There's a lot of work to do to get ready for the spin and so we've got work to do, getting ready for each step of that process. As we talked about in my remarks, we named the CEO, and we're adding to the leadership team and getting that built out. So that's really an important foundation. We have the Board Chair named and continue to work on filling out the Board. So those are important steps. I don't see -- the team has given us great confidence that we're going to continue to progress. And we're on track for the timing that we talked about in early 2024 and see ourselves getting there successfully. Importantly, for us, it's -- much of it is and we've talked about, it's about getting ready for the spin of health care, it's also about getting ready to stand up 3M as a stand-alone Company with a health care spin being completed. So we're putting focus there. And even what we talked about in the quarter that really driving the priorities that we are talking about, the execution in our operational execution is an important part of getting ready for 3M for the spin as well, and we're making good progress there, as you noted.\nMonish Patolawala: Just process-wise to add to Mike's comments, the teams are working through system changes, standing up legal entities and as well as all the regulatory filings, Scott, that we need to do, and that's what everyone is focused on from the health care side.\nScott Davis: That's helpful. So Mike, just taking your comments a little further, at the new 3M, do you envision a new 3M or you can kind of run at lower levels of CapEx, lower levels of even potentially R&D as a percent of sales. And the knock on 3M was always that it costs a lot of money to drive a point of growth and sometimes with the incrementals that worked out well. But in down cycles, that certainly did not work out well. But is there a new vision in 3M, I should say, that you can run at kind of more productive, efficient levels of CapEx and R&D?\nMichael Roman: Yes. Scott, there's a couple of dimensions to the answer to your question. The first starts with what we've been talking about. We announced a restructuring back in Q1, and that was really coming from what we had learned as we operated our businesses and we looked at where we were going with our supply chains in the face of some of the challenges in supply chains globally. And it was really behind that was an expectation that we could drive greater productivity, improvement in our execution, stronger performance, improved margins. And so that was really the foundation of that restructuring. And so I think part of the answer to your question is we took those decisions to lean out the center of the Company, simplify our supply chain, streamline our go-to-market models. Those are a foundation for the future of 3M. And those are -- you can see starting to demonstrate that we can drive improved financial performance for the Company. And that's -- we expect that to be a foundation for the future as well. I even talked about this is with that performance starting to build some momentum, we can accelerate how we view the future. And then you are talking about investing in growth and innovation and productivity and sustainability. And we'll continue to be our capital allocation, first priority is going to be investing in organic growth in R&D and CapEx. And really, thinking of and targeting high-growth market spaces, places where we can differentiate ourselves with our innovation capabilities where we can be aligned to emerging market trends. So I think that how we prioritize that investment is going to be aligned with where we see that ability to make a difference. So both are important foundations for the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin: Yes. Good morning. Just a question on electronics. It's been a headwind for a while. What KPIs are you looking at? When do you think -- and I think you said that was broadly in line with expectations. But when do you see the light at the end of the tunnel? When does it bottom -- what does it take for this business to bottom?\nMichael Roman: Yes, Andrew, I would say we came through third quarter. We still saw as we said soft end markets for electronics, and that's consumer electronics, it's into semiconductor. It's into a big part of our -- what we have as a focus in our customers and electronics. When we look ahead, there's some uncertainty, we're starting to see, as Monish said, electronics stabilize. I think that really reflects that we don't see it continuing to go down. It's starting to stabilize. There's some -- companies are talking about things getting better as they go forward. I would say we're watching it closely. We expect Q4 to look a lot like Q3 in our end markets, and I would say electronics included. So we're watching what we always watch. Our customers are large electronics customers in consumer electronics and semiconductor associated with data centers and those are the -- that's where we're going to be taking the lead from where we see demand going, where we see market performance going, when we see the market improve. We'll take the lead from them.\nMonish Patolawala: Just another data point for you, Andrew, at the end of second quarter, we had said that the way we predicted electronics was the amount of negative Vs quarter-on-quarter would get better. So if you compare us to the first half and the amount we were down year-on-year versus the third quarter, we are less down. It doesn't mean we are not down, but that's another point that Mike was trying to make is that's where we are starting to see some signs of stabilization. But as I said in my prepared remarks, I think we'll have to just watch how the holiday season plays out.\nAndrew Obin: Got you. And just a follow-up question on health care. I appreciate that you guys are doing a lot of sort of sort of accounting, et cetera, et cetera. But you have done the separations in the past. And I guess the question I have, any thoughts, as Bryan has joined the Company, I know in the past, there's been headlines about Health Information System being separated. I know there are other sort of businesses inside health care. Any thought about sort of maybe repositioning the portfolio as particularly as Bryan came on board, repositioned the portfolio for sort of future as a stand-alone Company.\nMichael Roman: Yes, Andrew, going back to really how did we think about the strategy to spin out health care. And one of the important questions was do we see health care as a leading health care technology Company attractive to shareholders with a great future. And that portfolio of businesses, the answer for us was yes. And that the -- the best way to create that value was to stand it up as a stand-alone Company and the portfolio work we had done even over time as part of 3M position it to be a successful stand-alone Company. And each of the businesses play an important role there. Now it is going to be an independent Company. We'll have a new CEO and a Board and they will develop the strategies for how they think about creating the greatest value driving growth for that business, thinking about how to really manage that portfolio of businesses as they go forward. So we see it as being ready to stand forward as a leader and are really confident in the leadership that will take the Company as a stand-alone.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.\nJoseph Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Can we start just on the restructuring, the benefits and the push out a little bit of the expenses? Just -- it seems like you're running ahead of schedule on the benefits. So I'd love to get any color about where this is. What you see coming in better than expected? And then also just on the push-out on the cost into 4Q, just what were some of the reasons for why the costs are getting pushed out from 3Q to 4Q?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So I'll just start, again, as a reminder, Joe, the total benefits for this program over the period of the program is $700 million to $900 million, with costs approximately of $700 million to $900 million. And coming into the year, we had said for 2023, we would see benefits in the ranges of $400 million to $450 million of benefits and equal offsetting charges. So when you look year-to-date, we are, I would say largely on track for the year, we still believe will be in the $400 million to $450 million of benefits, which will get offset by cost of $400 million to $450 million. So the teams have done a really nice job of continuing to execute. There are multiple pieces to this program. One was corporate simplification. The second was streamlining our supply chain. And third was making sure that we are closer to our customers in our business group units. And all three of these programs are running well on track. As regards to just timing from Q3 to Q4, I would say nothing big. We operate in multiple countries, as you know, and we wanted to make sure we follow all rules and regulations in those countries. And so some items dropped from Q3 to Q4, and we had a couple of other small investments that we had to make in Q3. They're just based on all the work the teams are doing, we just felt better to do it in Q4, so nothing major. So still pretty much largely on track, $400 million to $450 million of benefits for the year and $700 million to $900 million for the program.\nJoseph Ritchie: Got it. Okay. Great. That's helpful, Monish. And then I guess -- I know it's probably too early to think about 2024. But if you kind of think through like the price/cost equation from here on out, it seems like raw materials are becoming less and less of a headwind for you guys. Can you maybe just provide any type of framework for 2024 and ultimately, like how you think about both price and what you're seeing from a raw mat perspective?\nMonish Patolawala: So, I'll just start first, Joe, by 2024 is a little ways away. So I think our first focus is just getting Q4 done, getting the teams continuing to focus on our priorities. You've seen what our teams have done. So we continue to execute on our priorities. You've seen we have delivered a solid Q3. We have taken guidance up for the whole year. We're gaining momentum, and we want the team to continue to focus on doing that getting 2023 closed out. So when we get into 2024 and Q4 2023 earnings call, we'll definitely give you an update on 2024. To answer your question on deflation and price, I'll start with deflation. I'll start by saying, first of all, the headwinds that we have seen or the carryover headwinds are approximately $25 million in the quarter, which we called out, which was very similar to Q2. When you look at overall market and material, I would say we are seeing more disinflation than deflation. When you think about places where energy is still a little more -- is still inflationary, downstream materials are still inflationary and then labor is still sticky from an inflation perspective. Where we have seen some benefits is upstream chemicals and logistics and the teams have taken advantage of that. But I would say more importantly, I don't think the teams are just focused on material cost, they are more focused on saying, how do we drive overall cost down in the factories, whether it is driving yield and efficiency, whether it is dual sourcing, whether it is making sure we have alternate materials. That's what Peter Gibbons and the team is working. And the work that they have done through this year is clearly evident in the results that you're seeing. So that team has done a very nice job. And then when it comes to price, I would tell you, we came into the quarter -- into the year, we said low single digits price increase. That's what we are -- as of right now, we are on track with pretty much the same range. And Joe, as you know, you've followed 3M longer than I have. This is not a formula-based pricing. We are very thoughtful about it. We look at it market by market, product by product, and we make sure that the price that we are charging our customers is a representation of the value that we -- that our customers get. And I would say, if you leave 2024 aside for a moment, long term, 3M has always had a very good price/cost equation because of the value that we add to our customers. And I don't see that changing. And I believe that with the innovation that we bring with the customer focus that we have that, that equation remains.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. You may proceed with your question.\nChristopher Snyder: Thank you. One thing that has really stood out to us over the last couple of quarters is the underlying margin improvement of the business. if we ex out restructuring spend and savings, we see an operating margin on the underlying business of roughly 22% this quarter, first, less than 21% in Q2 and like a mid-'18 in Q1. So a very strong ramp here. Can you just talk about what's driving that outside of the restructuring, why is the underlying business seeing so much margin momentum?\nMonish Patolawala: So I would say, first, Chris, it's a huge thanks to the 3Mers who have been focused on their priorities. The priorities, as Mike mentioned, driving performance across all of 3M, spinning out health care, reducing risk by managing litigation is all starting to show up in the results. To your point, even if you exclude our restructuring costs and benefits, the margin rate is -- has shown a pretty good ramp. And that's driven, I would say, by two or three things. One is continued execution in the supply chain, with some of the restructuring that we have made and the supply chain is definitely more agile. We are also using a lot of data and data analytics. We have also learned through the pandemic on how to continue to operate our supply chain. So number one, you're starting to see the benefit of the improved yield and efficiency, you're able to take longer runs to as material gets better. Secondly, the team has been very thoughtful in proactive cost management to the extent where they saw there were places they could invest, they have; to the extent where we had lower volumes, we have managed to control cost. Third is we have had a relentless focus on working capital with inventory, and you're seeing that from a cash conversion basis. So I would just say it's continued good, strong operating performance that you're starting to see. And then as you add on the benefits that you get from the restructuring and once the cost goes away, which we have said this program will take approximately two years to complete out, you can see the overall, long-term benefits from the margin rate that you're going to get from better operating performance as well as better restructuring benefits. At the same time, you've got to keep in mind that we are that -- the teams are going to continue to watch this in the fourth quarter. It's an uncertain macro. But I'm very confident with what we're doing that the execution is there, but there's always more we can do, and we'll keep trying to drive more and more execution as we go.\nChristopher Snyder: I appreciate that. And maybe kind of taking that and bridging to the Q4 guide. It seems to us by our math, that you're kind of guiding underlying operating margins ex restructuring to something like 19% down from the almost 22% this quarter. I know revenue is down, but it seems to suggest a very sharp decremental. Can you just maybe talk about what's causing that margin step down? Because it feels like a lot of the improvements, whether it's supply chain or price cost are sustainable. Thank you.\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. Chris, again, depends on the math. I'll just start with margin rates in total. When we started the year or we came into the year, we had said margin rates for the year are going to be around 19%. At the end of Q2, we said margin rates are going between 19.5% to 20% for the year. And now based on where we are with the midpoint of our guide, our margin rate will be approximately 20%. So when you back into it, the fourth quarter is higher than the 19.5% that you have, it's somewhere in that 20.5% to 21% for the fourth quarter. And just to keep in mind, the reason you see this decremental. One is, of course, the restructuring is higher in Q4 versus Q3, plus it's higher of -- the midpoint is $95 million to $100 million of restructuring on a year-over-year basis, if you're doing year-over-year decrementals. The second piece to keep in mind is, in general, revenue in 3M drops from Q3 to Q4, you have less billing days or less business days in Q4. That's why our revenue guide, which is going from $8 billion, it goes down to between $7.6 billion and $7.7 billion, which is basically saying the underlying macro trends are the same. It's just lower billing days or lower business days, which also puts an impact. If you look at the history of 3M, Chris, and you look at Q3 to Q4, you will always see a pretty sharp decline from Q3 to Q4 in margin rate. And that's mainly driven by just the lower volume because of the less business days that come into Q4. Hopefully, that answered your question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, guys. So, Monish, I think at a conference a month ago, you had lowered your revenue guidance a bit and you sort of report $8 billion -- I think you had $7.9 billion to $8 billion. So maybe you can talk about the cadence of revenues for the quarter. Did any of your businesses pick up in September here in October? Are you just being conservative at the time? And then how are you thinking about the impact of higher rates on your businesses?\nMonish Patolawala: So I'll start by saying at that moment in time, what we saw is what we told you all, which we felt was in that $7.9 billion to $8 billion. There Was uncertainty in electronics, consumer and China, I would say, thanks to all the focus the teams have on taking care of customers, we were able to get to the high end of our range of $8 billion. I would say the same trends, Andy, pretty much stayed through the quarter. Electronics pretty much was where we thought it was going to be. China continued to remain weak and so did consumer retail. As Mike mentioned and so I have in my prepared remarks, we are seeing electronic stabilizing. We are watching for the fourth quarter what the holiday trends will bring for consumer retail. Back-to-school was softer than we expected. And then China, again, I would say is we are -- it's pretty much the trends we expected in China. Overall, for the fourth quarter, you'll see us having revenue of $7.6 billion to $7.7 million, which is again just driven by the fact you have less business days. On the other side, if you look at margin and you look at what the teams have done, the teams have continued to be very good on an operating execution perspective. We have continued to drive proactive cost control. We've done that in Q3. We'll continue to do that in Q4. And as a result, we were able to beat the 225 to 240. I had said in that conference a few months ago, and then we have raised totally a guide from 860 to 910 to 895 to 915. And then the other point, Andy, that's another bright spot is the cash conversion. The teams have done a marvelous job managing inventory, 130% free cash flow conversion in the third quarter, which has allowed us to raise our total year guide of free cash flow -- adjusted free cash flow conversion from 200% to 110% from 90% to 100%. So overall, the team is focused on operating execution.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Monish, if I can follow up on that, the cash conversion target raise. Maybe talk about your efforts. I know you talked about improving digitization at the Company, it seems like you're focused on digitization inventories having impact. So maybe you can talk about the confidence in generating higher cash conversion going forward, sort of the duration of these improvements as you go forward in '24 and beyond.\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. From the day of coming here, Andy, I've said working capital is a great opportunity for 3M. And through the pandemic, unfortunately, we had to build inventory levels and most companies did just to make sure we took care of our customers. And our first priority was always to take care of our customers. So we made sure we had enough inventory. As two things, as supply chains are stabilizing, number one, but more importantly, the execution that the teams are doing using data and data analytics and not -- and what I mean by that is not just going and using analytics, but being able to visualize by looking at data, they are able to see where the inventory is better. They are able to get a better demand signal, which allows them to get a better manufacturing signal, which allows them to get a better supply signal to their suppliers. And then the third piece is with all the work that we have done through the restructuring, where we have got the supply chain streamlined and restructured so that it's more agile. All of that is playing itself out in the inventory that we are seeing. I would tell you, as I said in my prepared remarks, there's more to go here. There's more that we can keep driving in this space. And we are going to continue driving it because this is a great place where we can continue to generate very strong cash for 3M.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. What are you planning and assuming for the auto strike impact for 4Q?\nMichael Roman: Yes, Deane, so it's something we're watching very closely. We're -- as you know, we stay very close with the automotive OEMs, our key customers there. We are -- we haven't seen a significant impact on our business to date. And we continue to watch it closely. We're staying connected on what happens week-to-week and impacting our demand. But it's something that as part of -- an important part of our global automotive business, the automotive as we talked about in the quarter, had very good performance. We had 16% growth in the quarter, outgrowing build rates and that's the broader core of our automotive business, our auto electrification business is growing even faster. So it's an important part. It's had some impact but relatively small impact to this point. Again, we're watching it closely as we move ahead.\nDeane Dray: Got it. And then you mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, the back-to-school sales were weak. Can you quantify that just maybe year-over-year? And then how does this set up for holiday sales with consumer being weak, higher rates? What's the assumption there as well?\nMichael Roman: Yes, Dean, I probably would point you back at some of the data out there about year-over-year spend back-to-school being down per student. There's a number of metrics out there. For us, our category broadly in consumer is exposed to like shifting discretionary spend. So that continues to be part of the consumer story. So it wasn't back-to-school story, only back-to-school was muted. We didn't see the strong replenishment cycles that we would have seen in a stronger back-to-school. So I think we confirmed the data that's out there. And as we look ahead, we're -- I would say we're just looking at the uncertainty around what happens for the holiday season as well. And so we'll be monitoring that. And again, there's a broader story around consumer, retail for us, the shift of spending from discretionary products into areas like food and I would say, experienced kinds of spending, that trend has continued. So those are both underlying some of the performance that we saw in consumer in the quarter and how we're thinking about it into Q4.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question.\nStephen Tusa: Hi, good morning. Could you just give just an update total expected now inflation kind of carryover for the year? I know you mentioned it in the second quarter. Is that unchanged relative to what you had said before? I think it was like $150 million? Maybe that changed?\nMonish Patolawala: No change, Steve.\nStephen Tusa: Okay. And then I guess, low single digits for the year on pricing. So that's kind of like a mid-single-digit volume decline. That kind of feels already recessionary. Things seem like very stable for you guys revenue-wise. How much of that negative 5% do you think is a function of destocking versus trend line on demand? And then just one last one for the fourth quarter. How much of that sequential sales decline are you expecting from electronics seasonality?\nMichael Roman: Yes. So Steve, maybe just thinking about the -- take the channel dynamic first, if you want. I would say -- when we look across the channel where we're seeing some destocking as in industrial channels, and that's really -- I think we talked about that last quarter, too, as supply chain performance has improved and stabilized. We're seeing the industrial channels shorten up their replenishment cycles. And so they're managing their inventory maybe back to more normal levels prior to when we got hit with some of the supply chain disruption. So that's the one destocking effect. There is some destocking in consumer that played out. The biggest part of that played out over the last year, retailers focused pretty heavily on taking out inventory. That seems to have played out, although there's some of that with the soft demand that's continuing. So it's, I would say, the rest of it -- when I look across the channel, otherwise, it's pretty stable globally; maybe some adjustments in China in some of those same markets as we continue to see the macro looking for where the macro goes as we go forward. Looking as we move ahead, electronics, we talked about stabilizing. It's really, Monish pointed out, it's part of it's a year-over-year comp. Remember last year, third and fourth quarter, we saw a decline in the electronics end markets, and we saw that in our businesses. So that's part of the view that Q4 stabilizes that year-over-year comp gets a little more -- changes a little bit as we lap some of those earlier declines from the first half. So I would say, we're staying close to that holiday season and what happens. That's an important season for electronics, and we'll be watching that closely as we go into the quarter.\nMonish Patolawala: Steve, I'll just add. I'll just add -- I just wanted to add one more disposable respirators is down $600 million on a year-over-year basis. That's approximately 200 basis points of growth.\nStephen Tusa: Right. So sorry, are you assuming kind of normal sequential seasonal decline in electronics, you are?\nMichael Roman: Yes. Well, in the broader business, we have seasonality. Some of that is normal end market cycles, but it's also billing days as well. We have the holiday season. So we see it sequentially from Q3 to Q4, we see that normal trend.\nStephen Tusa: Right, which you've always had, of course\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe: Hi, good morning guys. So you can have too many electronics questions. So what's got my attention in Electronics is the sequential growth from 1Q through to 3Q has been quite sharp. I think 1Q was about 680. I think 3Q is a 750 or so. I mean I know some of its seasonality, et cetera. But it must give you a lot of confidence that as we go into 2024, that at least in the first half of the year, we should be -- that should be a nice tailwind to the business. So any thoughts on that?\nMichael Roman: Well, Nigel, I would say it's going to depend on the outlook as we get to 2024 for electronics and those key end markets that you're talking about it. And we've seen -- maybe that's part of the stabilization that we're seeing is the quarterly trend in electronics and against that year-over-year comparable is stabilizing in the second half. What will decide the performance in first quarter or first half of next year will really depend on the demand that we see. And some of that will come through the holiday season, but we'll be -- we'll come back at our Q4 earnings call and update on how we're looking at the first half of next year.\nNigel Coe: Okay. That's great. And then I don't like to ask same macro questions necessarily, but you are pretty -- cycle, very channel-centric. The flash PMI for the U.S. was at 50 in October. Are you seeing more stabilization or maybe some sequential improvement in the U.S. relative to Europe and China?\nMichael Roman: Yes. I think Monish called out the performance in the U.S. was up slightly, and -- and that, I would say, mixed performance in our industrial businesses in the U.S., reflecting some areas of strength, but also some, I would say, caution and uncertainty around the broader economy. So I think we're seeing the U.S. performing a little better, up slightly. And that's -- I would say that's in spite of the challenges that we've been talking about in consumer retail. So Safety and Industrial posted, I think, mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. in the quarter. So that's a good reflection on what we're seeing more broadly. And maybe that PMI is aligned to that. That PMI represents kind of a middle kind of expectation from the purchasing managers\nMonish Patolawala: Just only other thing Nigel I will add to Mike's comments is just in certain pockets, we are seeing customers managing inventory channel. And part of it is supply chains are definitely far more stable. So customers have lower lead times, so they're managing that in pockets.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning, thank you very much. One quick question. I just wanted to circle back on your sort of pricing outlook as you see it because volumes have been soft for some time. Headline inflation in theory is easing. Traditionally, you do have price pressure in areas like electronics, just through nature of the industry. So I just wondered sort of what the comfort level was as you look into Q4 and early next year, that you can hold price kind of firm-wide at least flat at 3M? And whether there's been any change how you sort of go to market to push price just given the experience of inflation in the last couple of years?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes, Julian, I would just say the same thing that I said with another question before. The way I would just say long term, 3M has always been able to add value to its customers, and that is reflected in the pricing that it charges. We look at this not based on just a formula, but we look at it market by market, look at our competitive position and market by market, look at the value we add, and that's how we come up with our pricing that we go with. And I would say, based on the innovation and the value that we add to our customers, long term, I don't see that changing. In the short run, as you have seen, the Company has been able to manage inflation through price. And if needed, we'll continue doing that. But overall, right now, the teams are quite focused on delivering the fourth quarter, and then we'll see where long term goes this topic. It will be a function of demand, a function of inflation. So that's the way I look at it.\nJulian Mitchell: Understood. And then just to focus on a couple of markets within Safety and Industrial, but I guess had been pretty strong and most of the sort of rhetoric is fairly strong around them. But organically, you had a little bit of pressure at least or less growth in and that's the electrical markets and also automotive aftermarket. So I just wondered any color around those in terms of is it just kind of accelerated destocking distributors just holding off on orders for some reason? Any color at all on auto aftermarket and electrical?\nMichael Roman: Yes, Julian, I wouldn't -- we saw a little bit of destocking in electrical markets. That was one of the areas in industrial that we saw that impacting. And I would say our automotive aftermarket probably saw a little bit of adjustments given what we talked about and Monish highlighted that, improving supply chains, distribution and the channel are managing their inventories, their safety stock, so more in line with stable supply chain. So I think that's part of it. Those have both been seeing good market performance as we've gone through the year. I think again, we're watching closely the trends as we go into the end of the year. But really, it's, I think, reflects on the -- a little bit of destocking and also the end market demand.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.\nMichael Roman: To wrap up, we continue to execute our strategies, delivering results in a challenging environment while positioning 3M for the future, prioritizing high-growth markets and geographies where 3M innovation can deliver the most impact. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the 3M Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, July 25, 2023. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland: Thank you and good morning, everyone and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial and Transformation Officer; and Kevin Rhodes, our Chief Legal Officer. Mike, Kevin and Monish will make some formal comments, then we will take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Please turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note, throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release. With that, please turn to Slide 3 and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike?\nMike Roman: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. In the second quarter, we made significant progress on the important actions we have been taking to improve our performance and shape the future of 3M. We posted adjusted organic growth of negative 2.5% which includes a negative 1.7% headwind from the expected decline in disposable respirator sales. Revenue for the quarter was at the high end of our guidance range. Our adjusted operating margin was 19.3%, impacted by restructuring charges of $212 million or a headwind to adjusted operating margin of 2.7 percentage points. Excluding these charges, we increased operating margin year-over-year. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.17 and adjusted free cash flow of $1.5 billion driven by continued improvements in inventory management. Today, we are updating our full year earnings per share guidance to $8.60 to $9.10, up from a previous range of $8.50 to $9. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments, realize additional benefits from our restructuring actions and position 3M for the future. In the quarter, we maintained a strong focus on serving customers, driving operational execution and maintaining spending discipline. All business segments delivered sequential improvement in adjusted operating margins. Our restructuring actions and strong focus on cost management drove these margin improvements. Looking at our markets, trends played out as expected. We saw strength in automotive, both OEM and aftermarket, as well as highway infrastructure and personal safety, excluding disposable respirators. Health Care which was up slightly, continues to be impacted by lower post-COVID-related demand, notably in our Biopharma, Health Information and Medical Solutions businesses. We also saw continued weakness in electronics, consumer retail and China. Please turn to Slide 4. As we focus on improving our performance and managing a dynamic external environment, our teams are driving 3 strategic priorities: improving operational execution, successfully spinning off our Health Care business and addressing litigation. We are on track with our restructuring actions and have made significant progress in leaning out the center of the company, simplifying our management structure and streamlining our supply chain. The changes to our enterprise supply chain organization are enabling improvements in service, cost and inventory which helped drive our second quarter results. We are also taking advantage of the continued healing and supply chains to reduce logistics costs and improve production yields. We've also made progress in advancing our go-to-market models to bring our innovation closer to customers. In support of these changes, to date, we have initiated the transition to a new export model in 24 countries. I am pleased with how these changes are helping drive performance. We've made good progress on our planned spin of our Health Care business, including regulatory filings and system updates in preparation for soft spin. We are also in the final steps of naming a CEO. We continue to work towards closing the transaction by year-end 2023 or early 2024, subject to the required conditions and additional factors we have disclosed in our SEC filings. Last month, we announced an agreement, subject to court approval, to resolve public water systems claims nationwide in the AFFF multi-district litigation. This agreement will benefit U.S.-based public water systems that provide drinking water to a vast majority of Americans. The settlement covers all forms of PFAS. As we announced, we have taken a Q2-related charge of $10.3 billion payable over 13 years. Also related to litigation, we continue to participate in the confidential mediation process as part of the Combat Arms MDL and we'll provide updates as appropriate. To provide additional details on our PFAS settlement agreement, I will now turn the call over to Kevin. Please turn to Slide 5. Kevin?\nKevin Rhodes: Thank you, Mike and good morning. This is an important step forward for 3M. As Mike said, we have entered into a broad class resolution with public water systems that provide drinking water to the vast majority of Americans. We are taking a proactive approach to managing PFAS by establishing a more certain path forward for public water systems, communities and 3M. Subject to court approval, 3M has agreed to support PFAS remediation for public water systems that detect PFAS at any level and our agreement addresses all PFAS, not just those compounds that have been the primary focus of litigation to date. Our agreement also provides funding for eligible public water systems that may detect PFAS into the future and we have agreed to fund additional testing by public water systems as well. As Mike shared, the agreement terms entail a present value commitment of $10.3 billion paid over 13 years. Additional details regarding the payment schedule are available in our Form 8-K filed in June. While this agreement provides an alternative to continued litigation for class members and for 3M, we remain prepared to defend ourselves in litigation should the agreement not receive court approval or should public water systems choose to litigate instead. We are building on actions 3M has taken and continues to take. We were the first company to exit the manufacturing of 2 forms of PFAS, namely PFOA and PFOS which we announced more than 20 years ago. We have invested in state-of-the-art water filtration technology in our chemical manufacturing operations. And we have announced that 3M will exit all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. We will continue to build on this important progress as we focus on the future and work to proactively manage PFAS. Now, let me turn it over to Monish to provide more details regarding our performance in the quarter. Monish?\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you, Kevin and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 6. Our second quarter performance was driven by continued focus on serving our customers, improving manufacturing and supply chain productivity while also maintaining strong spending discipline. Also, during the quarter, we initiated a large part of our restructuring program to simplify and streamline the organization. We are aggressively reducing management layers and rooftops while also streamlining our go-to-market models and supply chain, bringing us closer to our customers. End-market trends continue to play out as anticipated with ongoing weakness in electronics, soft discretionary spending patterns in consumer retail and mixed trends in industrial end markets. Regionally, China's recovery has been slow, impacted by electronics and soft export trends. Europe remains challenged as the uncertain geopolitical situation persists, while end markets in the U.S. largely remain steady. Second quarter total adjusted sales were $8 billion or down 4.7% year-on-year. This result was a little better than forecasted as we experienced a smaller-than-anticipated headwind from foreign currency translation of minus 0.9% versus a forecast of minus 2%. On an adjusted basis, organic sales declined 2.5% versus last year. This result included an expected year-on-year headwind of approximately $140 million or 1.7 percentage points related to lower disposable respirator demand. Excluding this impact, Q2 adjusted organic sales declined 0.8%. On an adjusted basis, second quarter operating income was $1.5 billion with operating margins of 19.3% and earnings of $2.17 per share. These results included pretax restructuring charges of $212 million which negatively impacted adjusted operating margins by 2.7 percentage points and earnings by $0.31 per share. Without the impact of restructuring, second quarter adjusted operating margins were 22% or up 40 basis points versus last year and earnings were $2.48, up $0.03 year-on-year. Turning to other components that impacted results year-on-year; we were able to more than offset the impact of lower sales volumes and inflation impacts through improved manufacturing productivity, benefits from restructuring, strong spending discipline and selling prices while continuing to invest in the business. The net result was an increase to margins of 1.4 percentage points and $0.15 to earnings. The previously mentioned headwind from disposable respirators resulted in a negative impact to operating margins of 50 basis points and to earnings of $0.09 per share. The carryover impact of higher raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation created a year-on-year headwind of approximately $30 million or a negative 30 basis points impact to operating margins and $0.04 to earnings. As mentioned, foreign currency translation was a negative 0.9% impact to total sales. This resulted in a headwind of 20 basis points to margins and $0.02 to earnings per share. Divestitures, primarily Food Safety, did not impact margins but resulted in a year-on-year headwind of $0.03 to earnings per share. Finally, other financial items increased earnings by a net $0.06 per share year-on-year primarily driven by a lower share count which was partially offset by a lower non-op pension benefit. In summary, our team's focus on driving productivity, executing restructuring actions and controlling spending is starting to yield results. These actions, coupled with improvement in global supply chains, drove sequential improvement in adjusted operating margins across all of our business groups. Excluding restructuring charges, adjusted operating margins improved 3.6 percentage points sequentially. Please turn to Slide 7. Second quarter adjusted free cash flow was approximately $1.5 billion, up 44% year-on-year with conversion of 122%, up 50 percentage points versus last year's Q2. This year-on-year improvement was driven by our ongoing focus on working capital management, especially inventory and the timing impact related to restructuring charges. Inventory was flat sequentially versus a typical historical build from Q1 to Q2. We continue to adjust production output to end markets and leverage the power of daily management and data and data analytics to increase the velocity of inventory turns. Adjusted capital expenditures were $328 million in the quarter or similar year-on-year as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. During the quarter, we returned $828 million to shareholders via dividend. Net debt at the end of Q2 stood at $11.7 billion or down 12% year-on-year. Our business segments continue their long history of robust cash flow generation. In addition, our proven access to capital markets, along with the anticipated onetime dividend from the spin of Health Care at 3 to 3.5x EBITDA and 19.9% retained stake, will provide additional financial flexibility. This, combined with our existing strong capital structure, provides us the flexibility to continue to invest in the business, return capital to shareholders and meet the cash flow needs related to ongoing legal matters. Now, please turn to Slide 9 for our business group performance. Starting with our Safety and Industrial business which posted sales of $2.8 billion or down 4.6% organically; this result included a year-on-year headwind of approximately $140 million or 4.8 percentage points due to last year's COVID-related disposable respirator decline. Excluding disposable respirators, Safety and Industrial sales grew 0.2% organically in Q2. Organic growth was led by mid-single-digit increases in roofing granules and automotive aftermarket, while personal safety declined due to last year's disposable respirator comp excluding disposable respirators, personal safety was up high single digits organically. Closure and masking declined due to slowdown in packaging and shipping activity, while industrial adhesives and tapes continue to be impacted by end-market softness in electronics. Adjusted operating income was $614 million or down 2.4% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 22.2%, up 70 basis points year-on-year and up 2 percentage points sequentially. The year-on-year improvement in margins was driven by productivity actions, strong spending discipline and price. Partially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from lower sales volume, restructuring costs and inflation impacts. Moving to Transportation and Electronics on Slide 10 which posted Q2 adjusted sales of $1.9 billion. Adjusted organic growth declined 2.4% year-on-year, largely due to the continued decline in demand for electronics. Our auto OEM business increased approximately 21% year-on-year, approximately 600 basis points higher than global car and light truck builds. Our electronics business continues to be impacted by soft end-market demand for electronics. As a result, this business experienced a year-on-year decline in adjusted organic sales of approximately 22%. Electronic end markets continue to remain highly uncertain. We expect our year-on-year organic growth rates in electronics to remain negative in the second half, however, improve versus down nearly 30% in the first half as we start to lap easier comps. Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics; transportation safety grew high single digits organically, while commercial [indiscernible] digits year-on-year. Transportation and Electronics delivered $369 million in adjusted operating income, down 19% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 19.8%, down 3.6 percentage points year-on-year, however, increased 3.1 percentage points sequentially. Margin headwinds were driven by sales volume declines, restructuring costs and inflation impacts. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from strong spending discipline, productivity actions and pricing. Looking at our Health Care business on Slide 11; Q2 sales were $2.1 billion with organic growth up slightly versus last year. Organic sales in oral care were up low single digits year-on-year and Medical Solutions business grew slightly. Separation and purification and Health Information Systems declined mid-single digits and low single digits, respectively. These businesses continue to be impacted by lower post-COVID-related biopharma demand and ongoing stress on hospital budgets. As procedure volumes continue to improve, hospital budgets stabilize and we work through post-COVID-related impacts, we are confident in the long-term outlook of this business. Health Care's second quarter operating income was $411 million, down 16% year-on-year. Operating margins were 19.8%, down 2.8 percentage points year-on-year, however, increased sequentially 1.9 percentage points. Year-on-year operating margins were impacted by lower sales volume, restructuring costs and inflation impacts. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from strong spending discipline, productivity actions and pricing. Finally, on Slide 12. Our Consumer business posted second quarter sales of $1.3 billion. Organic sales declined 2.2% year-on-year as discretionary spending on hardline categories remains soft. We expect this trend to continue into the second half of the year. Organic sales grew slightly in home, health and auto care, while home improvement and stationery and office businesses both declined. Consumer second quarter operating income was $235 million, down 5% compared to last year, with operating margins of 18.2%, down 40 basis points year-on-year but up 3.2 percentage points sequentially. The year-on-year decline in operating margins was driven by lower sales volumes, restructuring costs and inflation impacts. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from strong spending discipline, productivity actions and pricing. That concludes our remarks on the second quarter. Please turn to Slide 14 for an update on our full year expectations. During our January earnings call, we highlighted that we expected macroeconomic and end-market uncertainties to continue to persist into the year. In addition, we noted that we were starting to see the healing of supply chains. However, we expected to continue to see headwinds from raw material availability and inflation, although at a lower level than 2022. We also stated that we were not satisfied with our performance and we would be taking a deeper look at everything we do as we continue to prepare for the spin of Health Care. As a result, we noted that as we move through the year, we would be taking additional actions to improve supply chain performance, drive simplification and bring us closer to our customers. While we have more work to do, let me take a moment to provide a few examples on the progress we have made through the first half of the year. Starting with our sales performance. While end markets continue to play out as expected, Q1 and Q2 revenue was slightly above our expectations. Our teams continue to relentlessly focus on serving our customers, work down backlogs and leverage the use of data and data analytics to drive improvements in demand planning. Next, as we have mentioned, we are aggressively addressing structure. We are on track with our actions to reduce structure across the company, including at corporate, in our business segments and in manufacturing supply chain. We have initiated the transition of 24 countries to an export model, partnering with local distribution to serve those customers and markets. In addition, we have made good progress in reducing corporate structure, including the exit of our aviation operations and our conference center in Northern Minnesota. And finally, we continue to adjust our production levels to end-market trends, manage inventory and aggressively control spending. As a result of our actions, along with improvements in global supply chains and raw material availability, we are able to deliver first half performance better than anticipated, particularly for margins, earnings and cash flow. In the first half of the year, on an adjusted basis, we delivered sales of $15.7 billion, operating margins of 18.6% and earnings per share of $4.14. These results included $264 million in pretax restructuring charges or a headwind to margins of 1.7 percentage points and to earnings of $0.38 per share. In addition, our strong operational execution and working capital management, particularly inventories, helped us to deliver $2.3 billion of adjusted free cash flow with a conversion rate of 105%. Turning to guidance; we are raising our full year adjusted earnings expectation as a result of our strong first half operational execution as evidenced by an improving margin rate. We now expect full year's earnings in the range of $8.60 to $9.10 versus a prior range of $8.50 to $9. We continue to closely monitor end-market trends across all our businesses, particularly in electronics, consumer retail, industrial and China and have yet to see signs of improvement in trends. Therefore, we currently see organic growth tracking to the lower end of our range of flat to minus 3%. This reflects our performance to date along with our year-on-year headwind from disposable respirators tracking to the high end of our anticipated range or down approximately $550 million along with continued macro and end-market uncertainty. And finally, our full year adjusted free cash flow conversion expectation remains unchanged in a forecasted range of 90% to 100%. Looking ahead to the third quarter; we expect end-market trends to be very similar to Q2. Hence, we anticipate third quarter adjusted sales to be approximately $8 billion. The impact from the COVID-related decline in disposable respirators and last year's exit of Russia is anticipated to be a year-on-year headwind to sales of approximately $130 million or 1.5 percentage points. Third quarter pretax restructuring costs are expected to be in the range of $125 million to $175 million with pretax benefits of $125 million to $150 million. Taken together, we expect third quarter adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $2.25 to $2.40. To wrap up, we continue to have a strong focus on serving our customers, improving the execution in our supply chain, making progress in our restructuring actions, managing costs and investing in the business while navigating ongoing end-market weakness. We expect our actions will continue to build momentum and improve our organic growth, margins and cash flow performance into the future. I want to thank our customers and suppliers for their partnership and the 3M employees for their hard work and dedication as they continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders. I am confident in our future. As we have said, as we exit 2023, we will be a stronger, leaner and more focused 3M. That concludes my remarks. We will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Just a question on the outlook. I think operationally, second quarter was quite strong. And I appreciate your commentary on organic growth but where is the caution in terms of operational results in the second half? What segments, what verticals are you particularly sort of concerned about, as I said not to raise guidance more given strength in the second quarter?\nMonish Patolawala: Thanks, Andrew. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, when we came into the year, we thought we would have end markets that remain uncertain as well as economic uncertainty would exist. Looking at where we in the first half, as I've called out, electronics continue to remain soft. We were nearly down 30% in the first half. We had consumer spending continue to remain soft. The consumer discretionary spending continues to remain soft. China remained soft in the first half. And then when you put all that together, you look at it and say, what are the trends we are looking for in the second half. And so what we are watching is electronics and see whether it's hit its bottom or not, we believe that electronic softness will remain. It's still going to be negative for the year but less negative in the second half. Consumer spending has remained soft in the first half. We believe it will remain soft in the second half. So we are watching back-to-school season and holiday season. Industrial activity has remained mixed. There are certain markets that continue to remain strong. There are certain markets that we are seeing a little bit of destocking in there. Health care elective procedures, we believe, will continue to go up on a sequential basis. At the same time, Biopharma and Health Information Systems are still constrained. Biopharma is going through COVID-related demand and HIS, or Health Information Systems, is impacted by stressed hospital budgets. As I've also mentioned in my prepared remarks, DR right now looks like it's going to be at the worst end of our range of down $550 million versus we thought it was going to be $450 million to $550 million coming into the year. And in China, we have -- second quarter was weak, down 4% on lower comps and we currently have not seen much of the recovery show up in China. Plus as a reminder, it was a tough comp in -- through 3Q of last year as China was coming out of COVID. So when you put all that together, Q3 is very similar to 2Q. And overall, the trends that we see make us feel that where we are right now in the first half and where we see trends going in the second half, we feel that from a revenue guide basis, we'll be at the lower end of our guide that we had given which was flat to minus 3% coming into the year. But with that said Andrew, if markets change, we will definitely be there to serve it. The teams are executing well as you have seen in the results that we have announced. We've got momentum on supply chain and supply chain execution. The team is doing a great job on restructuring and driving the cost as well as the team has hyper focus on making sure we are continuing to be prudent on our cost spending. But as we see these markets start to evolve in the second half and into 2024 and beyond, we won't hesitate to invest in growth in the high-growth markets because ultimately, we are in for the long run. Hope I answered your question, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Yes. No, I mean it's still sort of margin was pretty solid. But let me drill down on consumer electronics maybe a little bit more. What would it take for this business to finally turn positive? Or is it just sometime early next year, the comps get so easy that it can decline anymore? But what KPIs in terms of end markets are you watching?\nMike Roman: Yes, Andrew. Maybe I'll pick up on Monish's description of what we're looking at in the second half. And if you look a little further at the consumer electronics, we saw a soft first half in -- across all consumer electronics category, smartphones, TVs, notebooks, tablets. It -- you just saw -- and it was impacting our results as Monish outlined. And as we look into the second half, maybe there starts to be projected recovery in the markets in fourth quarter but really third quarter looks like the first half. And I would say picking up on inventory in the channel, we see destocking in a slowdown like this. And so we expect some destocking to continue in the electronics channel. So as we go into third quarter, that's kind of forming the view that we have. Now what would we need to see? We would need to see a turnaround in demand in those particular build rates in those end markets. And we'll see, I think, confidence show up in the inventory in the channel as well. So we're watching each of those categories closely in consumer electronics. And we also keep an eye on semiconductor capacity as well and how that's being -- how production is changing there. That gives you an indication of demand as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: So I just want to delve in a little more into your margin performance in Q2 and what it means for your second half. I mean, obviously, you had a nice step-up in sequential margin despite absorbing the 2.7% of pretax charges. So how do we think about the durability of the productivity actions, the positive price versus cost that look like was going on in the quarter? And how do you think about margin performance embedded in Q3? And Monish, the second half as it looks like you're forecasting margin below Q2 and Q3.\nMonish Patolawala: Yes Andy, I'll just start first with your question on sustainability, et cetera. There have been a few questions on cadence of restructuring charges and benefits. And we have attached an appendix that shows you by quarter where we expect to be for 2023 which is charges in the range of $400 million to $450 million and benefits in the range of $400 million to $450 million, so self-funding. The total program, as a reminder, is between $700 million to $900 million of charge and $700 million to $9 million -- $900 million of benefits. From a cadence perspective, depending on how the restructuring announcements play itself out, we've given you 2023, we expect 2024 charges by the end of 2024 to have pretty much taken most of the restructuring charges. The benefits, of course, show up in '25 and beyond. And once all these charges come to an end, the benefit is between $700 million to $900 million. Your second piece on where are we starting to see margin, as you have seen coming into the second quarter, one of the reasons for us able to beat expectations in the second quarter was driving supply chain efficiency. So factories started to heal better, raw materials started to flow better which allowed us to have longer runs. But at the same time, the work that the supply chain team has done under Peter Gibbins is starting to drive the execution and we are starting to see that in the results. And then, of course, the team is hyper-focused on cost control. So to answer your question on second half and how this plays out, one is you do have to adjust for the restructuring cost by quarter and you will see that the margin rate is climbing. Secondly, when we came into the year, we had said OI or operating margin will be somewhere in that 18.5% to 19% range. Sitting right now with a lower revenue number with a higher EPS number, we believe that we'll be somewhere in that 19.5% to 20% range which includes all the charges and all the benefits. What we are watching also is, to answer some other of your points, raw material and energy cost inflation coming into the year was $150 million to $250 million. We have now changed that to $150 million to $200 million. So we are starting to see the benefit there. What we have seen so far Andy, is disinflation which is lower inflation than last year. We are seeing the benefit in logistics. But however, some of our commodities still continue to be inflation. Inflationary and labor, frankly, is sticky from an inflation perspective in those commodities. But that also will play itself out as events play out through this year and into 2024 and beyond. And then we will continue to be focused on cost. Another item for us in the second quarter -- second half is as we are getting ready for the spin of Health Care, we'll be, of course, standing up the new management team. Mike already talked about that in his prepared remarks. There will be some cost incurred from a -- as these -- as we have management teams appointed that start getting ready to be -- have Health Care be a stand-alone company. And then, on -- I would just say on another housekeeping item is other financial, when we came into the year, we had said it would be minus 10% to flat on a year-over-year basis. We are updating that to minus 5% to flat -- minus 5% to plus 5% which on the midpoint is 0. First half, we got benefited by $0.11. Second half, it will be a negative $0.11 but that's on a year-over-year basis. So I gave you a lot Andy, just to make sure that you have enough information as you build your models out and you look at us in totality.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: No, that's very helpful, Monish. And then just for the next question, maybe just a little more color into industrial businesses within Safety and Industrial. I think you'd guided to down low single digits for the year and you continue to be down mid-single digit in Q2. I know last quarter, you described industrial markets as mixed, same description this quarter. But maybe you can characterize markets for us. Do you still see low single-digits decline for the year in industrial?\nMike Roman: Yes Andy, the quarter down mid-single digits, that was also impacted by disposable respirators down as we talked about, so about flat for the quarter outside of disposable respirators. And as Monish outlined, we're going to see more to the high end of our range of what we expected for disposable respirator declines in the year which means in third quarter, we'll see an impact from that as well. And when we talk about mix, it's really across the portfolio. We're seeing some strengths in our roofing granules, our automotive aftermarket business. The demand for car repair and around that business is strong. We saw some softness in electrical markets and abrasives. Our industrial adhesives and tapes business is impacted by electronics. So that's feeding into the industrial business as well. Personal safety, excluding disposable respirators, has been showing strength, up high single digits in the quarter. So that's kind of the mix picture. I -- we're also in the channel, we're seeing some caution from distributors. They're cautious about the outlook for industrial markets. They're also seeing the benefit of improving and healing supply chain. So cycle times are improving and they're pulling back on some inventory. So that's having some impact on our businesses as we come through the quarter and our outlook for the second half. So it's a mix. And the impact from China is part of that as well. We're seeing the slowdown in the markets there or the slow first half and not yet seeing an upturn in that and looking for that as we go into the second half. So, that kind of gives you a view across the -- what we mean by mix markets.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis: I'm curious, just overall, are you seeing areas or particular products or markets where you're getting some pressure to drop your prices, particularly given some of the weaker demand? Or do you feel like you can hold on to some of those price increases that you've gotten the last couple of years?\nMike Roman: So yes, Scott, I would say as you see -- Monish called it disinflation, moderating of inflation. You're going to start to have discussions around impact on price. I would say when we look at it, our price value is in the right place where we are, where we face our markets. You -- I would say the area where you have the most discussion, typically are retail markets. It's an ongoing discussion, it always is. Even in the times of high inflation, it's a strong discussion. But price is a topic everywhere, right? We're confident that we're priced in the right place as we come through this market dynamic broadly. So we're not looking at pressure specific in one segment or another. But I would say the conversation is something that we anticipate as we see disinflation and eventually, we see deflation, then we would expect it to ramp up.\nScott Davis: Okay, that's helpful. And guys, a little bit bigger-picture question. When you talk about supply chain streamlining, what do you mean exactly? I mean, how do you balance kind of the -- I'm assuming that means kind of localization. But between balancing between resiliency and not being relying on any particular supply partner but sometimes there's added costs that come into resiliency. So how do you think about streamlining and the cost-benefit of streamlining? And maybe you can give us a more concrete example of that to help us understand what that means specifically.\nMike Roman: Yes, Scott, maybe I'll step back for a second. As we came through the pandemic, we saw a lot of factors impacting our supply chains. Inflation, labor shortages, raw material availability, all that was impacting our production runs and really creating inefficiency in our factories, impacting yields. And as we came into this year, we started to see supply chains healing. We're seeing labor availability improving. Our -- Monish highlighted, we're still seeing inflation in labor. Raw material availability has improved. And we put a lot of focus during the most difficult times in the supply chain disruptions on multiple sources for raw materials. And we were engaging with many suppliers, hundreds of suppliers, on a monthly basis to try to manage those raw material interruptions. As they've healed, that's become much more focused on a few raw materials. We're seeing much better availability. All this is helping us run our factories a little more efficiently. We're seeing improvements in yield. We're seeing improvements in logistics as supply chains heal more broadly. And so as we stepped into the restructuring, we were taking stock of what we learned during the pandemic, what we learned during the restructuring, also what we learned as we moved to our global operating model. And so streamlining is really taking advantage of all those learnings and I would say also taking advantage of investments in data and data analytics, our digital strategies, investing in productivity, more broadly in our manufacturing models. And so streamlining is focused broadly across our supply chain. I talked about we're working to improve every aspect of it, better, more disciplined planning, taking advantage of data and analytics, stronger focus on sourcing, that dual sourcing, taking advantage of that strategy, what we can learn in the plants about running more efficiently and how we can manage logistics more efficiently. So plan, source, make, deliver, we're streamlining across that really taking advantage of the learnings and I would also say stepping into aligning to customers in our business models. And it's going to continue to be an opportunity for improvement. We'll continue to evolve this. But the restructuring actions really try to incorporate those learnings. And it wasn't a top-down. We're going to take out so much head count. It was how do we restructure, realign, streamline our supply chain plan, source, make, deliver to take advantage of all that and position us in the markets that we're in but also position us to be ready for a stronger performance as we go forward in the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: I appreciate the additional details on the restructuring, Monish. Just -- my first question really just around that deflationary point. Things are getting a little bit better or better than you originally expected. It seems like most of the inflationary headwinds have already occurred for the year. And so do you expect that to turn positive, I guess, by 4Q? Or is that something that could turn positive in the 3Q numbers?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So Joe, I think you have to break this up into multiple pieces. What I've said before is what we are seeing is lower inflation than a year-over-year. Our headwinds are somewhere in the range of 150 to 200 between electricity and carryover of raw material inflation. We have done 100 in the first quarter and we have done, I would say, between 25 in the second. So we still got a little to go on carryover. But when you talk about new inflation, I'll break this up into logistics costs are seeing in lower costs, partly driven by we are also reducing the amount of premium freight that we used during the pandemic because raw materials are flowing better. You are still seeing inflationary items in downstream. So upstream materials have started to show signs of moderation of inflation but from a downstream perspective, labor cost is still pretty sticky in inflation. So what I would say is we'll have to look commodity by commodity, market by market. And as things evolve in the third and fourth quarter, you should start seeing some of the cost on a year-over-year basis get better. If you recall last year, it was, I would say, October, November was when you started hitting peak of inflation and then you saw markets starting to moderate. It will also, of course, depend on ultimately what happens with monetary policy. It will also impact -- depends on demand that you're going to get from China and the rest of the end markets that we play in. So all put together, our current view is that things have gotten better, especially logistics. Material is flowing better which is definitely helping us run our factories better. We are seeing cost out and the teams are doing a nice job of driving it. But it will take a little bit of time for it to show up, depending on our year-over-year comp and how much of that material will be actually consumed based on the volume we produce. Long answer to your question but it's multiple materials. So it's not one that we buy, unfortunately.\nJoe Ritchie: Yes, that's super helpful. I guess my follow-on question, I know we talked a little bit about the weakness in electronics but I want to go back to it for a second. Is there a way to maybe just kind of parse out exactly what you're seeing in that end market? And then specifically, I know that Apple is considering rolling out like an all-OLED iPad next year. And I know when we went through that transition a few years ago on smartphones. That was a hot topic for your company. Any thoughts just around that specifically and how that impacts your business?\nMike Roman: Yes, Joe, I'll go back to my earlier comments. The decline that we've seen in the first half has really been driven by reduced demand in smartphones, tablets, TVs, those different categories. There is an ongoing shift in the display technology from LCD to OLED. And that's something we had talked about. As you noted, we talked about it a number of years ago, anticipating it. We continue to innovate on the OLED platforms but we do see some impact from that shift as we see the continued movement away from LCD to OLED in a few of those categories. So there's some impact from that. The bigger impact, again, is the demand in the end markets, smartphones, TVs, tablets and laptops, a few -- those categories.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS.\nChris Snyder: I wanted to ask on the restructuring program. So for Q3, if you just annualize the expected savings, it's about $500 million to $600 million which isn't far off the full $700 million to $900 million range which sounds like we shouldn't expect in 2025. So there's another $400 million to $500 million of spend coming post-Q4 '23. Is there any reason that the savings are maybe tracking a little bit ahead? Is there anything that's front-weighted that we should be aware about here?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes, Chris, a great question. So your math is right. I would also look at fourth quarter, where we have said $185 million to $235 million. You take that midpoint and you annualize that, you'll get to -- closer to the overall annual range. But when you look at the way our charges are, some of it is rooftops, some of this is noncash charges and some of it is restructuring people. All that put together in the first half, we have done $262 million. What is left to go which is, I think, your question in '24 and beyond, what happens with the cost, there are a couple of things. Geography by geography, we go through negotiations, make sure we are following all the regulations in there. So there will be a cost for that. And then we've got some other rooftops, et cetera, that take a little longer for us to exit that also happen in 2024 and beyond. So that's why you're seeing this the way it is right now.\nChris Snyder: Okay. Yes, I appreciate that. And then, it certainly feels like the savings here are coming in a bit quicker maybe than previously thought. I did not think there's anything in the guide for Q2 restructuring savings which obviously came through. Does that change the way you think about the plan over the next couple of years into 2025, just seeing the savings come through faster than you thought?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes, I would say, listen, on Q2, the teams knew that we had to execute well and early and they've done a nice job. Some of the benefit came from head count. But a lot of the other benefits that we've got, as Mike mentioned about streamlining the corporate, we were able to go after a lot of indirect costs in those areas, including exiting some of the rooftops that we wanted to that we were planning to early. So again, it goes back to a lot of focus on cost control, making sure that where we are spending our money on an indirect perspective also is well focused on. And that's where we were able to get to be off to a better start than we expected. So I give the team a lot of credit. They're going through very granular level of detail, making sure that we are doing the right amount of spend and focusing in the right place as we get the best return. So my credit to the team.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.\nNicole DeBlase: Maybe just starting with biopharma. So this is an area where we've seen weakness post-COVID for some time now. Have there been any green shoots there? I don't know if you think about like orders or what customers are saying about spend to the second half?\nMike Roman: Nicole, I -- well, I highlight biopharma as being one of the impacts on solid growth in health care is really a reflection of the post-COVID dynamic. So saw strong demand in biopharma for vaccines and therapeutics and we ramped up to serve that and the industry did broadly. And what you're seeing is kind of the other side of that demand and also the inventory, working off the inventory that was built up and trying to respond to that demand. So we're seeing both aspects of that. The space, the opportunity that we see for innovation and for us, growing the business, we see this as a long-term growth driver. We have new solutions that -- and one of the reasons we had value as we came through the opportunity vaccines and therapeutics is we could combine steps in processing, multiple steps into one. And so that demand is going to be there. As we look forward, the recombinant protein therapeutics are an opportunity going forward or just near term working through that post-COVID dynamic, both in end-market demand and inventory in the broader channel.\nMonish Patolawala: Nicole, I'll add one more is we are very confident and bullish about this business. In fact, we have added capacity to continue to have more production output out there as the demand comes back.\nNicole DeBlase: Got it. And just to clarify, in your second half outlook, like what's baked into the Health Care business? Have you embedded any improvement in biopharma? Or is the expectation that that's more of a 2024 dynamic?\nMonish Patolawala: So as I've mentioned, there is slight improvement that you're going to see in -- overall in Health Care. One is electric procedures should go up. Biopharma demand should start settling down. Hospital budgets are hopefully starting to bottom but we don't know that. So we'll have to see what happens with elective procedures. But overall, I would say there is improvement from a first half to second half in the market in general in Health Care that we have embedded into our guide. On the other hand, the thing we are watching also is oral care, Nicole, or orthodontics. Because as you know, if the economy slows down, that's an area that people will control their spending on. And so that's the other thing we're watching and, of course, China and seeing how the recovery in China plays itself out. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Mike has said it multiple times too, this is a great business. In the long term, this will continue to have very good growth. We are working through some comps from last year which was COVID as well as capital budgets and hospitals. But all those trends in the long term will turn themselves around.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nStephen Tusa: Just -- can we just calibrate? Because there's a lot of moving parts around the adjusted sales numbers. I think your guidance implies roughly like $7.9 billion in sales, like a modest sequential step-down from the third quarter just on an absolute basis. Is that right?\nMonish Patolawala: It's $8 billion.\nBruce Jermeland: For Q3.\nMonish Patolawala: For Q3. Is that your question? I'm sorry.\nStephen Tusa: No, Q4, Q4, Q4.\nMonish Patolawala: Yes.\nStephen Tusa: What's implied?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes, it would be around that range, between -- it's somewhere in that range. You're right.\nStephen Tusa: Yes. Okay. And can you just give us an idea of the range of the absolute margin? I mean we could probably do a lot of backing into it but what you now expect for the year from just a range on an absolute margin basis?\nMonish Patolawala: Between 19.5% to 20%, Steve, versus the 19% that we had told you coming into the year.\nStephen Tusa: That's great. And then, just one last one on these liabilities. So what was the change in the mindset from really drawing a bit of a hard line and talking about how the science made you guys look at this stuff and then taking what is still a pretty sizable $10 billion to $12 billion charge? Like what -- like that's a pretty significant change in mindset.\nMike Roman: Yes, Steve...\nStephen Tusa: What drove that internally?\nMike Roman: Yes. I think over the last several years, we've been talking about taking a proactive approach to managing our litigation and that includes the whole PFAS docket. And it's been part of our strategy and we talk about it kind of in short form that we're going to proactively manage it, defend ourselves in court and work to resolve through mediation as appropriate. And that's been really the guiding strategy and how we've looked at it. So as things evolve, we are making decisions around that frame.\nStephen Tusa: Does it matter where the stock price is and what that's reflecting when it comes to your -- how you think about this stuff?\nMike Roman: The addressing litigation, our strategy there is independent of what the share price is doing. I mean, certainly, there's an overhang in the stock price and the uncertainty around that. And we are focused on doing what we can to address litigation, help address that uncertainty. That's something we've been discussing with investors over multiple years. And so that certainly plays into it from that standpoint. We don't like the overhang on the stock and we want to manage it. But we've got to -- as we move forward, we've got to do what's in the best interest of the company for the long term. And so that gets back to we're going to defend ourselves in court and we're going to work to resolve as appropriate.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.\nDan Rizzo: This is Dan Rizzo for Laurence. Just a quick question on inventories that you've managed so well. How should we think about inventory turnover in the long run, I mean, over the next few years? What is kind of the go-forward thought process?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. You -- as I've said before, as supply chains start to heal, one of our big opportunities or opportunities to continue driving cash flow as inventories. The teams have done a really nice job of starting to use data and data analytics. We are getting better at doing demand planning. So I would say in the long term, you should see trends continue to improve from an inventory turns perspective. Because as supply chains heal, as we get better on demand planning, that's why you're going to see it. So you will see it get better in the long run.\nOperator: That does conclude the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing remarks.\nMike Roman: To wrap up, we continue to execute in a dynamic environment. While we see progress and positive momentum, we have more work to do. And we'll continue to advance our restructuring actions, control costs, strengthen our supply chain. At the same time, we will drive our strategic priorities, improving operational execution, successfully spinning off our Health Care business and addressing litigation. I thank 3Mers for their contributions and commitment, especially as we continue to lead through significant chain. We will stay focused on driving growth, improving operational performance and delivering value to customers and shareholders. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Mike?\nMike Roman: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before I recap our first quarter, I want to discuss actions we are taking to improve our performance. As you recall, over the past few years, we have implemented a new global operating model led by our four business groups, which included moving to a common global supply chain design end-to-end. We have since advanced our digital capabilities, further repositioned our portfolio and continue to invest in growth and productivity. Our experience throughout this journey, including lessons learned during the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and changing global trends has shown us what is working and what we can do better. As I said last quarter, we are looking at everything we do. Today, we are announcing additional actions to improve our cost structure, streamline our corporate center, strengthen our supply chain, enhance our go-to-market models and drive greater focus in markets, where 3M science gives us a clear competitive advantage. We will reduce costs at the corporate center by eliminating management layers across the company. We are broadly reducing our corporate shared services like our central design group. We are reducing rooftops worldwide, including exiting our conference center in Northern Minnesota. We are also simplifying and modernizing our technology by moving to the cloud and removing hundreds of legacy systems. This reduces costs and provides us greater agility and flexibility to invest in differentiated digital areas like data, analytics and automation while increasing investments in cybersecurity. We are simplifying our supply chain structure to better align with our businesses and improve performance in every aspect of plan, source, make and deliver while adding industry expertise to help drive our progress. The actions we are announcing today will help us complete our shift from area to global management, simplifying reporting lines and clarifying accountability. We are also taking out layers of management and duplication of activities across all areas of supply chain. Our progress in digital gives us better tools to use in the areas of planning, sourcing and logistics, removing redundant work and improving productivity. And we will prioritize our continuous improvement efforts in our largest factory operations. We will have a more efficient support structure and operating model to improve service, cost and inventory. We are streamlining go-to-market models to better align with customers, improve agility and reduce management structure. This is driven by our relentless focus on optimizing the path to our customer. We are not adopting a one-size-fits-all approach. We are customizing an approach for each business that ensures greater focus. In Safety and Industrial and Transportation and Electronics, we will eliminate certain area-based business group leadership and move to a division-led model. In Transportation and Electronics, we will also combine two divisions, further reducing structure. In Consumer, we will simplify how we go-to-market, with each area team aligned around their prioritized product portfolios and leading brands. In addition, we are changing our go-to-market model in approximately 30 countries around the globe, which represent less than 5% of our revenue. In these countries, we will leverage our digital and export capabilities and move to a model partnering with distributors with deep local knowledge and infrastructure, enabling us to significantly reduce our people, real estate and other related costs. Through our actions, we plan to eliminate approximately 6,000 positions globally in addition to the reduction of 2,500 global manufacturing roles we announced in January. In total, this represents about 10% of our global workforce and senior executive roles. Reductions will span all functions, businesses and geographies and be completed in accordance with local regulations. We expect to take total pre-tax restructuring charges of $700 million to $900 million, with approximately half of the charges to occur in 2023 and the balance to be largely taken in 2024. We anticipate the actions will drive savings in the range of $700 million to $900 million, expand margins and position 3M for future growth. We estimate that approximately half of the annualized savings will be realized in 2023. At the same time, we are continuing to build 3M for the future, prioritizing high-growth markets like automotive electrification, personal safety, home improvement, semiconductors and healthcare. We are also investing in large emerging markets that demand our material science innovation, including climate technology, industrial automation, next-generation electronics and sustainable packaging. As we move forward, we will drive additional cost reductions through improvements in sourcing, yield, productivity, factory automation and network optimization of our plants and distribution centers. Today, we are also announcing changes to align our leadership to our future direction. Effective immediately, Mike Vale is appointed Group President and Chief Business and Country Officer, a new role on the company\u2019s corporate operations committee reporting to me. In this new role, he will have responsibility for three of the company\u2019s four business groups: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics and Consumer; and also Country Governance. Jeff Lavers, who is leading our Consumer and Healthcare business, will now lead our healthcare business and support the company\u2019s progress towards a spin-off and the transition to a new CEO and management team. Jeff continues to report to me. Karina Chavez will become Group President, Consumer. Chris Goralski will become Group President, Safety and Industrial. Ashish Khandpur will continue as Group President, Transportation and Electronics. All three are experienced leaders at 3M and well-positioned to help drive the actions we announced today to improve our performance. Karina, Chris and Ashish will report to Mike Vale. In total, today\u2019s actions will make 3M more streamlined and competitive. Now please turn to Slide 4 for a summary of our first quarter. In an economic environment that remains challenging, we stayed relentlessly focused on serving customers and aggressively managed costs. We posted adjusted organic growth of minus 5.6% or minus 2.2% excluding our Russia exit and decline in disposable respirator sales. We delivered adjusted margins of nearly 18% and adjusted earnings of $1.97 per share, while expanding our adjusted free cash flow to $900 million. Today, we are affirming our full year guidance for organic growth, EPS and cash flow, which is inclusive of the restructuring charges and related savings. End-market trends played out as expected with ongoing weakness in consumer-facing markets. We saw continued strength in certain industrial markets, including automotive, electrical markets and abrasives. Our actions to reduce costs, which included plant spending, external services, travel and hiring, helped drive stronger-than-expected earnings and margins. We also continued to improve inventory levels, enabling us to deliver strong cash flow. At the same time, we are advancing our strategic priorities for long-term value creation as we make progress on the spin of our healthcare business. Turning to litigation, on Combat Arms, 3M continues to support Aearo Technologies through mediation discussions. We are focused on achieving a resolution that is efficient and equitable for all parties. With respect to PFAS, we continue to address litigation by defending ourselves in court or negotiating resolutions as appropriate. We also have a dedicated team to facilitate an orderly transition as we exit PFAS manufacturing and work to discontinue the use of PFAS in our products by the end of 2025. In summary, we are improving day-to-day operational execution, advancing our strategic priorities and taking necessary actions to move 3M forward. We are dedicated to building on our progress, delivering greater value for our customers and shareholders and exiting 2023 a stronger and more focused 3M. Monish will now take you through the details of the quarter. Monish?\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 5. As Mike mentioned, the first quarter macro and end-market trends have played out largely as anticipated. We experienced significant end-market weakness in consumer electronics, shifting consumer spending patterns along with the retailer destocking and mixed industrial end markets. We also continue to navigate COVID-related impacts in China and the ongoing geopolitical challenges in Europe. Given the expected challenging start to the year, we relentlessly focused on serving our customers and took very aggressive actions to manage costs and spending. These actions, coupled with a lower-than-expected foreign currency headwind, enabled us to deliver a first quarter that was better than forecasted. First quarter total adjusted sales was $7.7 billion or down 9.7% year-on-year. In addition to focusing on serving customers, first quarter sales benefited from a smaller-than-anticipated headwind to sales from foreign currency translation. The first quarter year-on-year translation impact was a minus 2.8% or approximately $230 million versus a forecast of minus 3% to minus 4%. We also experienced a 1.3% sales decline from divestitures or approximately $120 million versus Q1 last year. This decline was largely from the third quarter 2022 divestiture of Food Safety, along with the deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies. On an adjusted organic basis, first quarter sales decreased 5.6% versus last year. This result included an expected year-on-year headwind of approximately $300 million or 3.4 percentage points related to lower disposable respirator demand and the exit of our operations in Russia last year in the third quarter. Excluding this decline, Q1 adjusted organic sales growth was minus 2.2%. First quarter adjusted operating income was $1.4 billion with operating margins of 17.9% and adjusted earnings of $1.97. Turning to the components that impacted first quarter operating margins and earnings year-on-year performance, our Q1 margin and earnings reflect the previously mentioned lower sales volume. This lower sales volume, combined with our efforts to reduce inventories, resulted in lower manufacturing productivity versus last year\u2019s first quarter. We were able to partially offset these headwinds through pricing performance and aggressive cost management, resulting in a net headwind to margins of 90 basis points and $0.17 to earnings. As mentioned, we faced a challenging Q1 comp from last year\u2019s Omicron-driven disposable respirator demand, along with the exit of operations in Russia. This sales comp headwind resulted in a negative impact to operating margins of 1.1 percentage points and to earnings of $0.21 per share. We continued our focus on improving our manufacturing and supply chain operations, including executing on restructuring actions to streamline the organization and adjust to slowing end-market demand. Restructuring charges in the quarter were $52 million or a year-on-year headwind of 50 basis points to margin and $0.05 to earnings per share. The carryover impact of higher raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation created a year-on-year headwind of approximately $100 million or a negative 130 basis point impact to operating margins and $0.15 to earnings. As mentioned, foreign currency translation was a negative 2.8% impact to total sales. This resulted in a headwind of 30 basis points to margins and $0.10 to earnings per share. Divestitures, primarily Food Safety, along with the deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies, resulted in a year-on-year headwind of $0.03 to earnings per share in the quarter. Finally, other financial items increased earnings by a net $0.05 per share year-on-year driven by lower share count, partially offset by higher non-op pension expense. Please turn to Slide 6. First quarter adjusted free cash flow was approximately $950 million, up 24% year-on-year with conversion of 87%, up 37 percentage points versus last year\u2019s Q1. This year-on-year improvement was driven by lower annual incentive cash compensation and a strong focus on working capital management, particularly inventory improvement. During the quarter, we continued to address manufacturing production levels to better align with end-market trends. Since last August, we have driven an approximately $500 million reduction in inventory levels. As I\u2019ve said before, as supply chains heal and we progress the use of data and data analytics, we will see a reduction in inventory levels. Adjusted capital expenditures were $445 million in the quarter, up 15% year-on-year as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. During the quarter, we returned nearly $900 million to shareholders. Net debt at the end of Q1 stood at $12 billion, down 10% year-on-year with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.5x. Please turn to Slide 8 for our business group performance. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.8 billion or down 6% organically. This result included a year-on-year comp headwind of $285 million due to last year\u2019s Omicron-driven disposable respirator demand and exit of Russia. Excluding the impact from disposable respirators and Russia exit, Safety and Industrial sales grew nearly 4% organically in Q1. Organic growth was led by high single-digit increases in automotive aftermarket, electrical markets and abrasives, while the personal safety business declined mid-teens primarily due to the decline in disposable respirator demand. Excluding the impact from disposable respirators, the personal safety business grew low double digits organically. Turning to the rest of Safety and Industrial, organic growth declined high single-digits in industrial adhesives and tapes due to consumer electronic softness. And closure and masking systems was down low single digits as consumers pull back on discretionary spending, impacting e-commerce shipments. Roofing granules were down low single digits. Adjusted operating income was $562 million or down 19% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 20.2%, down 2.4 percentage points year-on-year. Margin headwinds were driven by lower sales volume, manufacturing and supply chain headwinds, carryover raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation, investments in the business and impacts from China COVID-related challenges. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from pricing, aggressive spending discipline and productivity actions. Moving to Transportation and Electronics on Slide 9, which posted Q1 adjusted sales of $1.7 billion. Adjusted organic growth declined 11.3% year-on-year, heavily impacted by a significant decline in demand for consumer electronic devices. Our auto OEM business increased approximately 6% year-on-year, in line with global car and light truck builds. We continue to gain penetration on new automotive platforms and expect to outperform build rates over the long run. Our electronics business saw adjusted organic sales declines in the mid-30% range. This business continues to be impacted by significant end-market weakness along with tiers and OEMs aggressively reducing inventories, particularly for smartphones, tablets and TVs. Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Advanced Materials had adjusted organic growth of high single digits year-on-year, while both transportation safety and commercial solutions declined. Transportation and Electronics delivered $284 million in adjusted operating income, down 36% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margin was 16.7%, down 5.5 percentage points year-on-year. Margin headwinds were driven by sales volume declines, manufacturing and supply chain headwinds, carryover raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation, investments in the business and impacts from China COVID-related challenges. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from pricing, aggressive spending discipline and productivity actions. Looking at our Healthcare business on Slide 10. Q1 sales were $2 billion with organic growth of 1.4% versus last year. Excluding the impact on the exit of Russia, Healthcare grew Q1 organic sales by approximately 2%. Sales in our Medical Solutions business and oral care grew low single digits organically year-on-year, while Health Information Systems was flat due to strained hospital budgets. Separation and purification declined high single digits due to the normalization of post-COVID-related biopharma demand. First quarter elective healthcare procedure volumes were approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels as nurse labor shortages and strained hospital budgets continue to impact the pace of recovery. We continue to expect procedure volumes to improve as we progress through the year. Healthcare\u2019s first quarter operating income was $360 million, down 19% year-on-year. Operating margins were 17.9%, down 3 percentage points. Year-on-year, operating margins were impacted by manufacturing and supply chain headwinds, carryover raw material logistics, and energy cost inflation, and investments in the business. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from pricing, aggressive spending discipline, and productivity actions. Lastly on slide 11, our consumer business posted first-quarter sales of $1.2 billion. Organic sales declined 6.8% year-on-year with particular weakness in the U.S., which was down high single digits. Stationery and office grew low single digits organically year-on-year, while the home improvement, home health and auto care business declined organically. Relative to first quarter last year, consumers have shifted their spending patterns to more non-discretionary items and retailers have aggressively reduced their inventory levels. We expect consumers to remain cautious with their discretionary spending as we move forward through the year. Consumer\u2019s first quarter operating income was $179 million, down 18% compared to last year with operating margins of 15%, down 1.8 percentage points year-on-year. The year-on-year decline in operating margins was driven by lower sales volume, manufacturing and supply chain headwinds and carryover raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from pricing, aggressive spending discipline and productivity actions. That concludes our remarks on the first quarter. Please turn to Slide 13 for a discussion on our outlook for the year and the second quarter. We are maintaining our full year guidance, reflecting a macroeconomic and end-market environment that remains very fluid and uncertain. Our outlook continues to incorporate the expected second half improvement in macroeconomic forecasts, including in China. We also anticipate the continued healing of global supply chains, which will help support ongoing product cost improvements in our manufacturing and supply chain operations, along with working capital performance, particularly inventory reductions. As a reminder, our full year adjusted organic sales growth is expected to be in the range of minus 3% to flat. This range includes an estimated 2 percentage point headwind from the ongoing decline in disposable respirator demand, along with the impact of our exit from Russia. Adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of $8.50 to $9 per share. Full year adjusted free cash flow conversion remains forecasted in the range of 90% to 100%. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. First, looking at external macroeconomic forecasts, both global GDP and IPI are currently expected to improve year-on-year and sequentially. The softness we experienced in Q1 in consumer electronics and consumer retail is expected to continue into Q2. We expect both sequential and year-on-year increase in auto bills, while healthcare procedure volumes are anticipated to be similar to Q1 levels and industrial end markets are expected to remain mixed. As discussed, we implemented very aggressive cost controls in the first quarter given the challenging start to the year, including on travel, advertising, external services and head count management. While we will remain disciplined, we expect to increase investments as we progress through the year to support end-market demand improvement in the second half and into the future. Including these factors, our expectations for Q2 are for total adjusted sales to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $7.9 billion versus $8.4 billion last year or down 6% to 8% year-on-year. Organic sales is expected to be down low to mid-single digits, which includes the forecasted year-on-year headwind of approximately 1.5% from disposable respirators. And finally, foreign currency translation is expected to be approximately a minus 2% headwind to sales versus last year\u2019s Q2 and divestitures a year-on-year headwind of minus 1%. From an EPS perspective, we estimate that second quarter adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $1.50 to $1.75, including a pretax restructuring charge of $175 million to $250 million or $0.25 to $0.35 per share. This range also incorporates the continued softness in organic sales and expected increase in investments, higher non-op interest costs and an adjusted tax rate of 18.5% to 19.5%. To wrap up, 2023 is a pivotal year for 3M from an execution perspective. As I mentioned, we aggressively managed cost, focused on serving customers while navigating end-market weakness, particularly in consumer-facing markets as we started the year. We expect organic sales volumes will improve as consumer retail and consumer electronics markets stabilize, China work through its COVID-related challenges as our year-on-year comps ease. The actions we announced today will enable us to exit 2023 stronger than we started and provide for significant margin and cash flow improvement into the future. I want to thank our customers and suppliers for their partnerships and the 3M employees for their hard work and dedication as they continue delivering for our customers. That concludes my remarks. We will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your may proceed with your question. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone.\nMike Roman: Good morning.\nMonish Patolawala: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Mike or Monish, maybe we could start off by just talking a little bit more about the sales cadence during Q1 and here in April because I think, Monish, you mentioned your Q2 EPS guide is modestly below Q1 even ex restructuring. What happened as Q1 evolved here in April? Have you seen signs of consumer and electronics destocking running its course? I know you industrial markets is mixed. Do you see any changes in industrial markets as the quarter evolved? And is it just that increased investment in tax rate holding down Q2 versus Q1?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. Thanks, Andy. So I\u2019ll just start again back to 1Q. As we said in the prepared remarks, end markets pretty much played out as anticipated. You had consumer-facing businesses, both our Consumer business and our Electronics business. The Consumer business was down 7%. Electronics was down 35%. China continued to remain soft in Q1. We were down 20% in China. And also the DR and Russia comps pretty much came in where we said. So the end markets played up pretty much as anticipated. Coming into the quarter, we had given you a guide of $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion. We came in at $7.7 billion. So that\u2019s at the high end of our range with some of the benefit also coming from a better FX rate at minus 2.8% versus the 3% to 4% that we had guided coming into the quarter. So when you look at that and you translate that into 2Q, I would still say the macroeconomic continues to remain fluid and uncertain. We are still seeing consumer weakness both in our Consumer business and in any of our consumer-facing businesses, especially consumer electronics. And so putting all that into the equation also looking into industrial markets that remain mixed, healthcare and oral care procedures pretty much remaining flat sequentially and then auto will be up a little bit sequentially and also up low double digits year-on-year. But then semiconductor is also down mid-teens on a year-over-year basis. Our current guide is $7.7 billion to $7.9 billion, which then translates to an EPS of $1.50 to $1.75. Included in that, Andy, in that $1.50 to $1.75 is a restructuring charge for the actions that we\u2019ve announced today of $0.25 to $0.35. So if you exclude that for a moment, then on an apples-to-apples basis, you\u2019re looking at $1.85 to $2. And the delta, if your question is about 1Q versus 2Q is the items you correctly said, which is some more investments as we think \u2013 as we look at the second quarter and the second half and the future, investments that we believe we want to take advantage of the markets as they get better in the second half, continuing to \u2013 but we will still continue to remain prudent with our investments depending on how the market evolves. And then it\u2019s the tax rate and some of the non-op that just sequentially looks tighter. But with that said, just for the year, again, we are maintaining guidance, which includes the restructuring charge of $700 million to $900 million for the program. We expect half of that will be incurred in 2023. And the benefits from that program are also $700 million to $900 million. And we expect the benefits \u2013 half of those benefits also to show up in 2023. Just for you to know and for others, we\u2019ve announced a significant announcement today. Some of them are organizational changes and business combinations or division combinations. We will be working through all of the reporting \u2013 our reporting on the new division basis. We plan to do that from 1Q 2024 onwards.. Hopefully, that answers your question, Andy.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Yes, Monish. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Mike, I wanted to ask you, $700 million to $900 million cost takeout, obviously, a relatively large program. How do you avoid business disruption and/or lower growth given all the changes you\u2019re going to make here? And then assuming the second half of the program does get executed mostly by \u201824, maybe for Monish, how do we think about 3M\u2019s ability to generate that 30% to 40% incremental moving forward? If you do see sales rebound later in \u201823 as you expect and in \u201824, for example, should you see unusually high incrementals given the program?\nMike Roman: Yes. Andy, as I said 3 months ago, we\u2019ve been looking at everything we do as we come through the pandemic, come through the supply chain disruptions even face into the outlook for the year and our markets as we move ahead. So the actions that we\u2019ve come to, they have been something that we\u2019ve been very deliberate about thinking through. They are taking from learnings about what worked well and areas that we know we can improve. So it starts with a pretty strong basis. We\u2019re confident that these are the right actions about positioning us for growth and profitability as we go forward. And it will help us navigate \u2013 as Monish just laid out, help us navigate some of the challenges and uncertainty we have in the current market. So our focus is \u2013 as your question kind of indicated, our focus is on executing successfully. And that\u2019s \u2013 these are significant changes. We\u2019re confident we\u2019ve got the right focus. We\u2019ve made some leadership changes to really ensure that we have our leadership focused on successfully making these improvements. And I think that this is the next step for us. We believe and we\u2019re confident these will be the steps that really help improve our performance in our businesses and our supply chain. And as the second part of your question focused on, it\u2019s about improving our costs and margins. Reducing our costs and improving our margin performance gives us a position to be successful in the future, leverage our innovation to create differentiated value with customers and deliver that to the bottom line performance that we expect both in terms of margins and cash flow. So it does position us for confidence in being able to do that as we go forward that incremental margin from our differentiated innovation. So yes, that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s exactly the reason and confident we\u2019re positioned at the right \u2013 with the right strategies in place.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan Securities. You may proceed with your question.\nStephen Tusa: Hi, good morning.\nMike Roman: Good morning, Steve.\nMonish Patolawala: Good morning, Steve.\nStephen Tusa: So just on this restructuring cost, can you maybe just give us a quarterly cadence on the costs and then the savings? And I mean getting half of the savings this year, that seems like a pretty quick payback on half the spending. Like is there anything unique to this program that would have an accelerated payback like that? It seems like a one-for-one on a quarterly basis, which is pretty fast.\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So I\u2019ll just start again, Steve. It\u2019s $700 million to $900 million. We expect half of that to be incurred in 2023 and $175 million to $250 million to be incurred in the second quarter. The benefits of that program is also half in 2023, very little in 2Q. So the benefits actually show up in the second half. The reason the benefits are stronger than you would have normally seen as not all of these costs are just people-related costs. We are taking a lot of other costs out from the center of the company, we\u2019re reducing rooftops, et cetera, which allow us to exit some of these cost structures faster, and that\u2019s why you get a better payback.\nStephen Tusa: And so as far as the cadence of the charges, is there \u2013 is it \u2013 should we assume that they are spread throughout 3Q and 4Q and additionally with the savings, 3Q and 4Q?\nMonish Patolawala: Right now, I would just focus on 2Q and the total year. And we will update you, Steve, as we get through the announcements today and work through all the people-related costs and work through the rules and regulations in various countries. I would just focus on total year-end and 2Q.\nStephen Tusa: Okay. And then what was \u2013 as far as like the go-to-markets are concerned and how you\u2019re changing things, what was the catalyst for this? What did you see in the business that you thought you needed to improve on from a go-to-market perspective with all these changes that you were talking about? It seems like some pretty significant initiatives from that perspective and a change in the way you guys have done business historically. What was the catalyst for that? What did you see that you didn\u2019t like?\nMike Roman: Yes. I think the catalyst is really the learning and experience that we\u2019ve gone through over the last few years. We put in place a business-led model really around our go-to-market models. We also put in place a global supply chain model that was end-to-end managed in one consistent model across the world. And we\u2019ve been operating that through the pandemic, through the supply chain disruptions. Our businesses are learning, the go-to-market models that we have in place, we\u2019re learning how to optimize those. And I would say we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve gotten to a point when we look at where our markets are going in the future, where we want to invest, how we want to operate best to serve our customers. It\u2019s really a learning \u2013 more of a learning over that experience than a catalyst. There is a catalyst, that\u2019s to position ourselves as we take action now for the future, make sure that we are stepping into the changes that will both drive the performance in the near-term and also position us for the future. So the learning was really \u2013 and I think the clear view of what we can do to improve in the go-to-market models and also in our supply chain that is really, like I said, giving us the strong focus on the actions that we\u2019re taking and announcing today.\nMonish Patolawala: Can I just add one more, Steve? As \u2013 I\u2019ve always said this before, digital is a multiplier for 3M. And some of the digital capabilities that we have built over the last few years allows us to serve customers better. For example, Mike mentioned one of the areas where we are relooking at how we go to market in certain countries where in the past, we have had a full roof stop and a full cost structure, and now we\u2019re going to work through our partnerships of third-party distributors, leverage our digital capabilities, leverage our export capabilities. And that also allows us to reduce cost while making sure we still continue to take care of customers in those countries.\nStephen Tusa: Great. Okay, thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. You may proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning, Mick and Monish, Bruce.\nMike Roman: Good morning.\nMonish Patolawala: Good morning.\nScott Davis: We\u2019ve got a couple of different \u2013 I mean this restructuring is large as the fellows have said. But you\u2019re also going to be getting out of the PFAS manufacturing business. Is that included in the restructuring? Or there\u2019ll be separate actions kind of sequentially on top of that as you exit each of these things?\nMike Roman: Yes, Scott. The PFAS exit, I would say this, we are executing what we announced at the end of last year and working to discontinue the use of PFAS in our products and working to exit the manufacturing. It\u2019s not a specific focus in the restructuring actions. That\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve got a dedicated team following through on that set of actions, and we continue to make good progress. We\u2019re working closely with customers and, I would say, making progress on our innovation to discontinue the use of PFAS in our products across the company. So it\u2019s a separate focus, separate team and a separate strategy for us.\nMonish Patolawala: Just to remind us, Scott, from a numbers perspective, when we announced the exit of \u2013 the intent to exit our PFAS manufacturing and reduce our use of PFAS in our products, we had announced a fourth quarter charge. We said the total program would cost us $1.3 billion to $2.3 billion. In the fourth quarter of last year, we took a charge of $800 million, which was largely non-cash. We continue to make progress around that. Our current excluded numbers include what that \u2013 the extra charge in the quarter. For a total program basis, we still expect to incur right now $1.3 billion to $2.3 billion.\nScott Davis: Okay. And Mike, I wanted to just ask you on R&D productivity. I mean when you think about the investments that you guys have made over the last 50 years forever, there has been time periods where growth has been great and a lot of support on the margins. And then there is been, perhaps the last decade, where I\u2019d characterize growth is pretty minimal and maybe not as much support in the margin structure as you had in the past. But is part of the restructuring and the changes you are making to help drive more accountability and productivity in R&D? Is it \u2013 is there a \u2013 I mean I guess, a more polite way to ask the question is, is there any cultural or structural problems in R&D that you can address and perhaps improve that productivity going forward?\nMike Roman: Yes. Scott, I think it\u2019s an important part of the actions we are announcing today, I would say, is to position us to be successful in delivering on the differentiated value that is 3M innovation. And we are always innovating around how we do that. We \u2013 I talked about in the announcements today that we are prioritizing some large, high-growth market segments where we have strong commercial presence and we can leverage strong innovation. So, I think if there is a kind of a consistent message over the last year or so from me is that we are prioritizing more and more where we focus that R&D investment. It\u2019s still the first priority in our capital allocation, invest in R&D, invest in CapEx to drive that growth. We see the opportunities in those high-growth market spaces. We also called out and we are \u2013 as part of our actions that we are announcing today, we are putting in place a central group to really focus some of the capabilities that we have in broad material science going after some emerging market segments like climate tech and industrial automation, sustainable packaging. Next-generation electronics has got over the horizon some really exciting spaces. So, it\u2019s about continuing to evolve that prioritization. And the businesses, they have got, I would say very clear focus on where their priority markets are, where their customer opportunities are that they can really create the most differentiation. So, that\u2019s the, I would say a continuous innovation and evolving nature of how we think about investing in R&D, how we think about driving growth. And our goal remains the same, to leverage our innovation, to grow at or above the macro of the economies that we are part of and really focusing on those high-growth market segments so that we can do that.\nScott Davis: Okay. Helpful. Good luck guys.\nMike Roman: Thank you, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. You may proceed with your question.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. I wanted to ask on China. I think you guys called out China down 20% in the quarter. Was that worse than you guys anticipated? And it sounds like there is an expectation of China stabilization or improvement as the year goes on? Is there anything you are seeing here through April maybe that gives you confidence that things there are getting better? Thank you.\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So, Chris, we did call out down 20%. It\u2019s pretty much played out exactly where we expected it to be when we gave you the first quarter guide. And in the second quarter, currently, we are expecting China to be down low-single digits to mid-single digits. But sequentially, a few days into April, it\u2019s pretty much playing out where we saw. And just talking to customers, talking and looking at all the external factors, there is an expectation that China GDP grows and increases in the second half sequentially and year-on-year. And our full year guidance, as I have talked about, assumes overall recovery in all economies in the second half, including China. And as supply chains continue to heal, we should start also seeing the productivity or cost reductions in our cost of goods to start showing up in the second half. And so sitting right now, that\u2019s how we see China. China was impacted heavily by consumer electronics down in the first quarter, and that\u2019s also reflected in our results.\nChris Snyder: Thank you for that. And then for my follow-up, I wanted to ask on the destocking that you are seeing at the customer level. I think you guys called out retail as destocking year-to-date. And then we have seen the same in the data. Can you maybe just talk about where you think the supply chain is in that destock cycle? Thank you.\nMike Roman: Yes. Chris, we talked a bit about the consumer retail destocking as we came into the year, and we saw that play out in Q1. There \u2013 I would say, in the U.S., in particular, retail has been destocking in the discretionary categories. And we saw that, and that was part of our expectation and pretty much played out as expected. We see that getting back to closer to your more consistent weeks of stock, but there is still probably some destocking to continue there, not maybe as aggressively as we saw in Q1, but we still see that playing out as we move ahead. We are also seeing destocking, I would say, across some of the industrial markets. So, we talked about that back on our Q4 earnings call as well that it was maybe out of cautious view of the outlook, and I would say that has played out as expected. We saw destocking in China around the slowdown in electronics. Also, in automotive, we \u2013 China saw a slowdown in automotive builds in Q1 and Asia more broadly destocking around electronics. I think the automotive levels more broadly given the growth are relatively in balance, maybe even low in some areas. Healthcare is pretty well aligned with the market and the recovery that we are seeing in procedures. I think the consumer is also seeing the dynamic of seasonal builds. There are some seasonal builds going on in the channel as well. So, some destocking, which played out as expected in the first quarter, I would say some of it carrying into the second quarter as we go forward. And then when you see the downturn in demand in electronics, there is naturally some destocking in the channels related to electronics as well.\nChris Snyder: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi. Good morning guys.\nMike Roman: Good morning Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: I just want to follow-up on the restructuring program. Mike, Monish, I think you guys have had a few programs now over the last several years. And I know that they are approaching different aspects of the cost elements and different regions, etcetera. But trying to roll up to where do you see the margin entitlement for the business as we get through these programs over the next several years. Is there anything that you sort of have pencil out there that we should keep in mind, especially with a few of these programs overlapping and different mix changes, etcetera, going on within the business?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes, Josh. So, I would say a couple of things. One is, of course we have to have these programs work through. As we said, it\u2019s $700 million to $900 million. A large piece of those charges will be completed by 2024. So, you would start seeing the benefit without these charges in 2025 and beyond. That time, of course you had to think through what the revenue is. But if you just use 2023 as a guide, as a basis, the margin expansion, excluding these charges are when these charges are done, is a 200 basis points to 300 basis points of margin expansion that you should see on an annualized steady-state basis. What I would tell you is that allows us to definitely get the better leverage that we have all been talking about. But the second other factor that comes into play is, as supply chains start to heal, you should start seeing productivity and cost-out starting to show up, which again is in our second half guide for the year. But that should continue into the future years. And then you add on data, data analytics and the digital capabilities that we have, that will allow us to do better network and logistics optimization, also dual-sourcing programs kicking in, etcetera. So, we should continue to see margin rates expand into the long-term once these programs are done. So, hopefully I answered your question, Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Yes. That\u2019s helpful. And I will leave it there with the interest of time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie: Hi. Good morning everyone.\nMonish Patolawala: Hey Joe.\nMike Roman: Good morning Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: So, I know we have had a bunch of questions on the restructuring. I want to delve in a little bit deeper there because there is lots of cost levers that you described. I am just curious, is there a way to bucket perhaps like some of these \u2013 how big, like whether it\u2019s reducing the layers or supply chain is in that $700 million to $900 million cost-out? And then maybe specifically on the simplification piece, again, any kind of quantification, like how many P&Ls are you streamlining? Any other color around that would be helpful.\nMonish Patolawala: So, Joe, the $700 million to $900 million, if we just break it down to broad buckets, 40% of it is around the supply chain simplification that Mike talked about. The remaining 60%, you can split between costs at the center of the company and costs at the BGs. From a P&L perspective, a couple of items that Mike talked about, again, on the go-to-market. There will be a couple of divisions in TEBG that will be combined. And then from a consumer perspective, we will serve our customers more from an area perspective and then realign them around portfolios. And the other piece on a go-to-market cost saving is, as we look at some of the countries, the way we serve using our digital capabilities, we will look at using our partnerships that we have with our third-party distributors in those countries and use a digital/export model to serve those customers in those countries, which will also allow us to take out rooftops and fully loaded P&Ls in those countries that will also allow us to save cost.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. That\u2019s super helpful. And maybe my follow-on question, I didn\u2019t hear it earlier, but how much pricing came through this quarter? What\u2019s the expectation going forward on price/cost?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So, depending on the business group, Joe, we had anywhere between low to mid-single digits. The average is low-single digits. The guide for the year is low-single digits. And at the same time, as we have said before, if we continue to see inflation, we will readjust as needed. The teams have done a good job, I would say, of looking at it product-by-product, market-by-market and making the right necessary price moves as required when they see inflation.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning.\nMike Roman: Good morning Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: Good morning. Maybe leave aside the firm-wide restructuring for a second. And I just wanted to focus on the healthcare business as that\u2019s meant to spin out in a matter of months. The margin is down pretty heavily year-on-year again, down sequentially as well and not a lot of organic growth. So, just trying to sort of understand how comfortable do you feel with that healthcare business kind of ahead of the spin? Are we seeing a big front-loading of investments, so it has kind of less to do post-spin? Just trying to understand kind of the approach there for this year and why those margins seem to be under such pressure.\nMike Roman: Yes. Julian and I will come to kind of the organic growth and margin. I would say we continued to see the healthcare procedures as an important driver of our healthcare performance. And there, we see some improvements. Monish highlighted in his prepared remarks some of the headwinds and challenges that are still \u2013 the labor shortages and some of the challenges and healthcare recovering to pre-pandemic levels. So, that\u2019s important factor in driving our growth. If you look at our business, we also had some headwinds from the Russia exit in DR and so close to 2% organic growth. And we expect as procedures do recover that we will see improvements in our organic growth. On the margin side, Monish called out some of the headwinds, we have \u2013 still seeing some supply chain headwinds, still seeing some carryover from material, raw material and logistic inflation, energy cost inflation. And we are making some investments, investing in \u2013 it is a prioritized area of growth for us, and we are making and really staying focused on those investments. So, it\u2019s a \u2013 it is part of the performance in the quarter. But again, confident that as procedures improve, we will see growth and growth gives us the best leverage to the margin. We will see those margins improve as we see some of the supply chain healing and some of the actions that we are taking help impact that as well.\nMonish Patolawala: Just one more to add is biopharma. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, biopharma this quarter was also impacted due to the normalization of COVID-related demand. And as Mike mentioned, the healthcare business is \u2013 for us is a great business. We will see volumes grow as elective procedures grow, oral care procedures go and biopharma demand comes back once we get the normalization out of the way from an inventory level. And with all that put together, the margin rates will also go up as volumes come through. But this is again a segment Mike has called out multiple times an area where we see great opportunity, which means we will continue to invest in that segment to make sure we take advantage of long-term growth.\nJulian Mitchell: Thank you. And then just my follow-up on electronics specifically, I think you mentioned, Monish, that was down sort of 35% in Q1 year-on-year. It looks like the second quarter is down maybe in the teens based on Slide 13 in electronics. How are you thinking about that sort of rate of improvement? What\u2019s baked into the back half for electronics in your guidance? Do you think we should see year-on-year growth by the fourth quarter for electronics? Any sort of color there around how you are looking at that business through the balance of the year?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. That\u2019s \u2013 you got it right. Right now, our second quarter is also going to get impacted continuing inventory challenges and destocking at consumer electronics, whether it\u2019s tablets, notebooks, TVs. Our view is that as China stabilizes as we start seeing our comps ease compared to last year, fourth quarter should be on a much more normal run rate, which means on a year-over-year basis, it will show positive growth.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning.\nMike Roman: Thanks.\nNigel Coe: Yes. Great. Thanks. So, just wanted to touch on the Mike Vale as Group President, just first of all, congratulations to Mike. But how does this change your role, Mike Roman, in terms of your focus areas? I mean Mike is obviously \u2013 seems like he is getting direct for the three segments. I mean how does this change your focus areas going forward?\nMike Roman: Yes. Nigel, I think it\u2019s a reflection on really what are the strategies and actions that we are driving and the priorities that we are focused on right now and the importance of having leadership that brings the necessary focus as we go forward. And so it\u2019s even looking back to 2022, the \u2013 some of the pivotal actions that we announced as we came through the year, they are the healthcare spend, our actions in terms of our supply chain changes, focusing our leadership now with the actions we are announcing today to go further and really make the changes in our \u2013 the next set of changes in our supply chain, moving forward with our new go-to-market models. Mike\u2019s role is really focused on that. When I talk to Mike about stepping into this leadership role, it\u2019s about really ensuring success as we drive these actions and changes forward, position us for the future, help the businesses working with the supply chain to be successful in integrating these changes and building for the future, help us to focus on the high-growth market segment. So, it\u2019s really about putting up \u2013 taking our priorities and putting a strong leadership support in place to drive that. These are important and really significant actions that we are putting in place and important that we have. We also are supporting our leadership with a dedicated project management office. These are significant changes. So, it\u2019s really a strong statement about what\u2019s most important both on the restructuring, but also on our strategies in terms of growth and executing for our customers.\nNigel Coe: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks Mike. And then one for Monish, just a follow-up on Joe\u2019s question on pricing. It seems like given the 1.3 percentage points hit to margins from raw materials, it seems like price/cost was positive this quarter. Just wondering if there had been any change in the way you are viewing the supply chains to raw material kind of dynamics for this year.\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. No change. I would say it\u2019s the same. So, price/cost was positive, and the teams continue to manage both. As we think about the second half, that\u2019s where supply chains, our belief is supply chain start healing, which means we should be able to see better cost \u2013 product cost from our factories as well as the cost from sourcing. That should continue to help us build on margins, which goes back to where \u2013 what we have talked about at earnings, talked about it at last quarter earnings, currently too, that all of this is baked into our guide where we see supply chain starting to heal in the second half and even markets starting to heal in the second half because as you know, we have talked about volume gives us the best leverage. So, those are the two things we are counting on in the second half.\nNigel Coe: Alright. Thanks a lot and good luck.\nMonish Patolawala: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nMonish Patolawala: Good morning.\nMike Roman: Good morning Deane.\nDeane Dray: Can we get an update on the healthcare analyst meeting? And what\u2019s the effect on the separation of R&D? There is so much in way of shared technologies. What\u2019s the plan there and also for stranded costs?\nMike Roman: Yes. Deane, maybe I will make a comment about the R&D. So, this is something that we have managed with other separations and divestitures and nothing of the healthcare spend scale, but it\u2019s something that we are able to manage. We have \u2013 part of the focus of the separation team is on this area, and it\u2019s important to be able to set up both healthcare and 3M going forward with the strong foundation for innovation that they both need. And you \u2013 the fields of use are actually quite distinct between healthcare and what will be 3M Company going forward. So, that\u2019s a really a big part of it. And then we work through the details, make sure that we are positioning both companies to have the \u2013 not only the access to the technology, but the intellectual property that is at the foundation of what makes our innovation really that differentiated. So, making good progress on that and feel like that\u2019s an area that we have a good roadmap ahead for us to follow.\nMonish Patolawala: Just on your second question on timing. As you know, Deane, last quarter too, Mike had said, the teams are continuing to make good progress. This quarter too, they are making good progress. We were going \u2013 we were working towards a Q4 \u201823, early 2024 timeline. But just a reminder, our spin timing ultimately is subject to the IRS rulings because we want this to be a tax-free transaction, government approvals, making sure we get final Board approval and also take into account other conditions like equity and debt markets, other external conditions that could impact \u2013 on other developments that could impact 3M or any of its business. So, put all that together, I would just say that teams are focused, dedicated teams continuing to make progress, working through all the government regulations that we have to work through to get ready.\nDeane Dray: That\u2019s helpful. And just if you can comment on the plan for stranded costs, and are there other spin-offs being contemplated by the Board?\nMonish Patolawala: So, I will just \u2013 on stranded costs, when we announced this transaction mid last year, one of the items we have talked about was that benchmarks were anywhere between 1% to 1.5% of revenue is stranded cost. And we had talked about saying, we believe we can do much better than that. Based on all the actions that we are taking today, currently, our view on stranded costs ultimately depends on the revenue of ParentCo too is between 50 basis points to 75 basis points, so much lower than benchmark. But we will keep working it. We will keep working it from now until the end of the \u2013 until the spin-off. And we will keep working it post that too, to reduce that.\nMike Roman: And Deane, I would say we are focused on successfully moving forward and making \u2013 successfully making progress with the spin of healthcare. And we are, of course focused on the actions that we announced today. So, we don\u2019t plan on any other major portfolio actions in the near-term.\nDeane Dray: Thank you.\nMike Roman: Yes. Thanks Deane.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question.\nNicole DeBlase: Yes. Good morning guys. Thanks for squeezing me in.\nMike Roman: Good morning Nicole.\nNicole DeBlase: Hey. In the interest of time, I am just going to ask one, and that\u2019s, can you just comment on how organic growth kind of trended throughout the quarter, if there were any discernible differences between Jan, Feb, March and then into April? Thank you.\nMonish Patolawala: So, Nicole, I would say overall, the quarter pretty much played out as we thought. Jan, Feb, March, we expected acceleration, which we saw. April is also playing out pretty much where we saw. So, there is \u2013 I would say there was nothing in the intra-quarter trends in Q1 that stood out from where we had expected it to be. China remains soft, consumer-facing businesses remains soft, industrial end markets ex-electronics remain strong. And then healthcare elective procedures pretty much remain the same. And you normally in that industry see a Q4, Q2 or 1Q slowdown just as procedures slow down, and we saw that too. So, nothing I would say is major to call out intra-quarter in 1Q.\nNicole DeBlase: Thanks Monish.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.\nMike Roman: To wrap up, we are taking significant actions to create a streamlined and stronger 3M. We will stay focused on creating greater value for customers and shareholders, improving our performance and using 3M science to make a difference in the world. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the 3M Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded Tuesday, October 22, 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland: Thank you and good morning, everyone and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Bill Brown, 3M\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Anurag Maheshwari, our Chief Financial Officer. Bill and Anurag will make some formal comments then we\u2019ll take your questions. Please note that today\u2019s earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Please turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today\u2019s conference call, we will be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note throughout today\u2019s presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today\u2019s press release. With that, please turn to Slide 3, and I\u2019ll hand the call off to Bill. Bill?\nBill Brown: Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. First, I\u2019d like to take a moment and welcome Anurag to his first 3M earnings call. Anurag recently joined 3M in early September after serving as CFO of Otis. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of working with Anurag off and on over the past 20 years and look forward to his leadership and partnership as 3M\u2019s CFO. Earlier today, we reported strong third quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.98, up 18% on 1% organic revenue growth. Our overall company margins increased 140 basis points to 23%, and free cash flow was $1.5 billion, with conversion of 141%, and we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter via dividends and share repurchases. These results extend our strong 2024 operating performance with non-GAAP earnings per share over the first three quarters, up 30% on 1% organic revenue growth. As a result of the team\u2019s strong operational performance and disciplined capital deployment, we raised the bottom end of our full year earnings guidance by $0.20 to a range of $7.20 to $7.30 versus a prior range of $7 to $7.30 per share. During our Q2 earnings call, I described our top three priorities: number one, driving sustained top line organic growth through both reinvigorating innovation and improving commercial excellence; two, improving operational performance across the enterprise; and three, effectively deploying capital. As I mentioned in July, getting more productivity out of our R&D investments is going to take some time, but we are beginning to make progress on both R&D effectiveness and efficiency. A lot of our recent efforts have focused on the basic blocking and tackling and improving the fundamentals of our R&D and commercialization processes. For example, we have taken actions to improve enterprise-wide visibility on specific investments in our product development pipeline. And we are driving new rigor and discipline into product launch calendars and raising accountability for post-launch sales performance. We are fast-tracking projects for low-risk product line extensions eliminating non-value-added activity from our engineers\u2019 workload by offloading or outsourcing administrative tasks and increasing pipeline velocity through efforts as simple as reducing the time to setup an SKU from 100 days on average last year to about 60 days this year. And to address bottlenecks and drive productivity in the product development process, we are shifting capital spending within our existing budget to fund upgrades of R&D facilities to allow us to scale rapidly from lab to pilot to manufacturing. And finally, we are shifting about 100 people within R&D to focus on new product development, including those who are rolling off PFAS-related projects and adding more than 50 new engineers in the fourth quarter to high priority focus areas such as specialty materials and films for the automotive, aerospace, electronics and semiconductor markets. After a decade-long slide in new product introductions, we bottomed out and are starting to turn the corner with new product launches expected to be up about 10% this year with a further acceleration next year. I recognize these are only initial steps on a long journey toward bending the organic growth curve. And in the meantime, we have to improve how we execute at the customer interface. We are working through the details of how we staff, train and incentivize our sales force, price our products, leverage our distribution network and capture cross-sell opportunities, and we\u2019ll share those details as they evolve. But one area where we\u2019ve seen continued progress is delivering on-time in-full or OTIF to our customers. I know we\u2019ve lost business and have paid fines due to poor delivery performance. And I\u2019m encouraged by the steady improvement we\u2019re making, ending Q3 at 89% OTIF, up 5 points since the beginning of the year and 10 points above Q4 of 2022. As we push harder on OTIF, we are getting more visibility on the weak links in the value chain from the performance in our factories, to our suppliers and to our logistics providers. In our factories, we are looking harder at the reliability of our assets and our capacity to surge. And we\u2019ve now implemented a common metric to measure operating equipment efficiency, or OEE, across the major assets in our 38 largest facilities. Utilization on these machines going back to the beginning of the year, averages around 50%, well short of best-in-class companies, importing opportunities to free up capacity to better respond to quick turn orders by optimizing changeovers and improving maintenance practices. When it comes to our suppliers and contract manufacturers, we are implementing more rigorous standards and expectations for on-time performance, which has been running in the low 60% range for the past few years and is now in the low 70s. A common theme in all of these discussions is the need for significantly higher demand visibility and forecast accuracy, which has been running in the mid-60% range, 10 to 15 points below expectation and well below best-in-class companies. We recently kicked off a project to redesign our forecasting process and we are in the early stages of a 15-week sprint to test and tune our demand plan for two large divisions using different analytical tools. Initial results through the new model show a lot of promise in improving forecast accuracy, which will allow us to level load our factories, reduce inventory throughout the value chain and improve on-time delivery to customers. As I mentioned in July, this is a back to basics focus on fundamental approach that lays the groundwork for a more holistic look at network complexity. While we have closed facilities in the past and have a few more in flight today, gaining maturity in our OEE metric will allow us to take a fresh look at consolidation opportunities at both the site and the work cell level over time. A critical enabler of our OpEx agenda is the depth and capacity of our operations leadership team and we continue to onboard new talent, particularly in the areas of quality, materials planning and continuous improvement. These efforts are all part of a broad operational transformation at 3M, the foundation of which is a safety-first culture. While our injury rate has improved versus last year, it\u2019s not where we want it to be. Earlier this month, we launched a company-wide campaign called Journey to Zero that engages every employee in our drive towards an injury-free workplace. Turning to capital deployment. Through 9 months, we have generated $3.5 billion of adjusted free cash flow with conversion of 102%, after investing $1.7 billion in R&D and CapEx. We have returned $2.7 billion to shareholders, including share repurchases of $1.1 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we are actively reviewing our portfolio with a few small businesses now in the early stages of a sale process. So overall, we are making progress on the three priorities that I\u2019ve laid out, and I\u2019m encouraged by the energy and desire of our team to win by delivering for our customers and creating value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Anurag to provide more details on the quarter and our updated guidance. Anurag?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Thank you, Bill. Starting with overall company third quarter performance on Slide 4, total adjusted sales were $6.1 billion, with organic growth up 1% or up 2% excluding geographic prioritization and product portfolio initiatives. These results reflect end market trends that were largely in line with expectations, including mixed industrial markets, strong growth in electronics, a decline in automotive OEM build rates and continued softness in consumer retail discretionary spending. Looking geographically, adjusted organic growth was led by Asia-Pacific, up mid-single digits, driven by our electronics business. The U.S. was flat with strength in home improvement and commercial branding and transportation, offset by a tough comp in personal safety as self-contained breathing apparatus benefited from significant supply recovery last year. And EMEA was down low single-digits due to the decline in global car and light truck builds. Adjusted operating margins expanded 140 basis points to 23%, driven by benefits from improved organic growth, continued productivity and restructuring. This strong operating performance, along with benefits from below-the-line items resulted in adjusted EPS of $1.98, up 18% or $0.30. Turning to revenue by business group on Slide 5. Safety and industrial sales were $2.8 billion, with organic growth of 0.9%. The growth was primarily driven by the industrial adhesives and tapes division, which saw particular strength in bonding solutions for electronic devices. In addition, we saw growth in roofing granules and electrical markets, while the balance of the divisions was down slightly due to ongoing market softness and unfavorable prior year comps. Transportation and electronics adjusted sales were $1.9 billion, up 2% organically. Our electronics business delivered high single-digit organic growth as consumer electronics, OEM customers ramp production volumes ahead of the upcoming holiday season. Automotive and Aerospace division organic growth was down mid single-digits in the third quarter. The auto OEM business declined in line with global car and light truck builds, while aerospace delivered strong growth driven by bonding and acoustic solutions. Year-to-date, our total auto OEM business was up 4% versus a 2% decline in global car and light truck build rates. We continue to gain penetration with adhesives, tapes, display films and electronic materials on multiple new auto OEM platforms. Looking at the rest of the transportation and electronics, Advanced Materials grew high single-digits with strong glass bubble demand for light-weighting applications in transportation and oil and gas markets. Commercial Branding and Transportation was up low single-digits driven by demand for graphics and pavement markings. Finally, the consumer business sales were $1.3 billion. Organic sales declined 0.7%, which included a 2.3 percentage point headwind from portfolio prioritization. Home improvement delivered mid single-digit growth driven by new products in our command portfolio, introduced for the back-to-school and holiday seasons. The remaining divisions within the consumer business declined due to portfolio prioritization actions as well as retail customers continuing to be price-sensitive and value focused. Through the course of the year, the consumer business has improved and we expect the trend to continue in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 6. As mentioned, on an adjusted basis, we delivered Q3 operating margins of 23%, up 140 basis points and earnings per share of $1.98 or an increase of $0.30. Operational performance, including organic growth, along with ongoing benefits from productivity and restructuring contributed 160 basis points to margins, while foreign currency was a headwind of 20 basis points. These items, combined with acquisition and divestiture impacts, contributed $0.14 to earnings. The remaining $0.16 of EPS growth was driven by last year\u2019s high tax comp, along with benefits from net interest and a lower share count. Turning to cash, we generated solid adjusted free cash flow of $1.5 billion in the quarter, driven by strong income generation and positive working capital flows while continuing to invest capital to support growth and sustainability. Conversion for the quarter was 141%. Overall, we have had very strong year-to-date operating performance. We have expanded margin 380 basis points, grew EPS by 30% on 1% organic growth and generated $3.5 billion of free cash flow with conversion of 102%. Based on this performance, we are updating our full year 2024 guidance on Slide 7. We expect our full year adjusted organic growth to be approximately 1%, with business group estimates unchanged, with safety and industrial flat to up low single-digits. Transportation and Electronics, up low single-digits and consumer down low single-digits. Full year adjusted operating margins are expected to be up 250 to 275 basis points versus the prior range of 225 to 275, driven by continued momentum from productivity. The operational benefit, combined with lower net interest expense and share count, gives us confidence to raise the lower end of our EPS guidance by $0.20 to a range of $7.20 to $7.30. Finally, our expectation is that we will continue to deliver robust cash flow with strong working capital performance in the fourth quarter. With year-to-date conversion at 102%, we expect that the adjusted free cash flow conversion performance will be 100% plus for the full year. Before we turn to Q&A, I want to take a moment to thank the 3M team for the warm welcome. I am excited for the opportunity ahead of us and look forward to working with the team as we execute the priorities Bill has laid out. With that, let\u2019s open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning, everybody, Bill, Anurag and Bruce.\nBill Brown: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Davis: And congrats to all on a good start here. Yes, I want to talk a little bit about this operational transformation, it seems like a pretty heavy lift, but obviously, you\u2019re making some progress, but last quarter, you spent some time on supply chain, not in prepared remarks, not as much this quarter, how big of an opportunity? Is that kind of step two or step three down the road and kind of getting the supply chain reoriented? And how big of an opportunity do you think that is, Bill, now that you have had a little bit more time in the seat?\nBill Brown: So, Scott thanks for the question. Look, we continue to make good progress across all of the elements in our operations. Our cost of goods sold is $13 billion, a piece of it, a big piece of it is supply chain. So obviously, that is a high degree of focus. We are looking to drive 2% net productivity, so 2% net of inflation across all those elements, including in supply chain. We have about 25,000 direct suppliers, including 4,000 contract manufacturers. Our teams are working hard to consolidate that, drive performance. And we continue to do a good job on this. I think we are at the front end of what I would say to be a long journey. I think we get a lot of value out of basic negotiations. I think we have a lot more opportunity as we think more about value engineering in our product, that\u2019s a relatively small component of our overall supply savings. So, the teams are working, I think, very, very hard on this. Again, as I step back across all the $13 billion, if you drive and get 2% net, you\u2019re talking $650 million more or less of $250 million, $260 million worth of net productivity. There is a lot of value there that we can capture year-over-year. I spent a little time in my prepared remarks talking about one of the key levers, because I think it\u2019s both a growth and an operations level and that\u2019s delivering on-time in-full. And we are getting \u2013 doing very well \u2013 very good job in our factories. The team is performing well, but it\u2019s pointing out some opportunities to drive better supplier performance. And we are really, really focused on that. We have seen some improvements over the last year, but I think a lot more to do in terms of driving the full value chain performance improvement, including with our supply base.\nScott Davis: That\u2019s helpful. And Bill, you talked a little bit about needing to change the incentive structure a little bit, will you \u2013 do you think you\u2019ll have a new incentive structure and comp plan in place for 2025? And what does that really mean? Does that mean kind of increasing the variable component? Can you really dialed in kind of to where you want it this quickly?\nBill Brown: So, good question, Scott. I think look, before we get to the comp plan, I think what\u2019s going to be more important for us is to make sure we have very clear objectives across the management team, deep in these organizations. So we all understand what we\u2019re accountable to achieve to shareowners into one another. I think that\u2019s step one. And I do think we have an opportunity to get a little more crisp on our objective setting process. But of course, the back end of that is comp plans I think you will see some adjustments in our \u201825 comp plan. We are out speaking with shareowners about that based on the results we had earlier this year in our AGM. But yes, we\u2019ll continue to look at our comp plans, not just at executives, but as it flows into the organization. And importantly, with our between 5,000 and 6,000 salespeople out there, we will continue to look at, do we have the right incentive structure to drive the right behaviors across the full 60,000 plus people in the company. So Scott, there is going to be changes that will be made. We\u2019ll talk more about that as they come to fruition in the coming months.\nScott Davis: Okay. Thank you, Bill. Best of luck, guys.\nBill Brown: Thank you, Scott.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next now to Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Good morning. I guess I\u2019ll ask two questions. Follow-up on Scott\u2019s questions, just, Bill, what are your views on centralization inside 3M? I know Mike pushed for a lot of centralization, which was a departure from what his predecessor Inge Thulin has done, which ran the company in very, very decentralized way. So, just would love to hear how your operating philosophy has evolved since you joined the company? That\u2019s part one. And part two, we are just getting a lot of questions on insurance recovery related to PFAS and combat arms, particularly given the new side of carrier where they indicated that perhaps, they could indicate, they could recover insurance in excess of their cost. These are public statements. So any sort of publicly available updates on where you are in the process on insurance recovery would be helpful? Thanks so much and congratulations on a good quarter.\nBill Brown: Great, Andrew. Thanks for the questions. I mean, first of all, I think about 2.5 years ago. Mike did consolidate all of our factories and supply chains under a common leader, under Peter Gibbons I think it was the right thing to do. It allows us to look across 110 plus or minus factories and close to 100 \u2013 to an 80 and 100 distribution centers and really look at performance, performance metrics, how they compare with one another. It\u2019s a network, they flow together. So artificially separating them that by a business group or by geography did not make a lot of sense, so you\u2019ll get the power of the whole by looking at all of the operations together. So, if you call it centralization, I call that global coordination. I do think that was the right step and it was smart to do that. And we are reaping the benefits of that. And I think going forward the value we\u2019ll be able to get out of operations is because of that operational, that organizational change. So I think it was the right step. I think the move to globally coordinating business units, depending upon the business, some we run globally, some we run regionally, but all within those three broad business groups. I also think that was good. There will probably be some adjustments in how we structure the BGs over time, perhaps within the three business groups. There are certain geographies that stand out that we are really focusing heavily on and we want to put a little more attention on. But generally, I think Mike was taking the right steps and particularly in the supply chain area. So that\u2019s on that piece on sort of your point about centralization. On insurance recoveries, just quickly, you\u2019ll see this in the Q. In Q3, we\u2019ve covered $54 million in insurance recoveries between combat arms and public water suppliers, year-to-date, it\u2019s over $175 million. Recovery efforts continue. I know it\u2019s top of mind given what other folks are talking about. We are active in arbitration and litigation with multiple insurers. We intend to ramp up our recovery efforts in the coming days and weeks. And we do expect our insurers to honor their policy obligations to us in full. The difference with others is our liability that we settled for is quite a bit higher than our insurance \u2013 total insurance value. So it\u2019s a little bit different than others, but we are ramping up our efforts and we are starting to recover, and we\u2019ll recover more over time. We\u2019ll update investors each quarter and through our Q as we recover more on insurance.\nAndrew Obin: Thanks very much.\nBill Brown: You bet.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next now to Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. And Bill thanks for the update. These are really helpful. On the insurance point, I just wondered could you maybe clarify what the total coverage would be from a product perspective. And I understand that you are working on ramping up the recoveries there. But my first question is really around the 2 points of net productivity. You\u2019ve got a lot of initiatives in play here. You\u2019ve got the supply chain nationalization, OTIF target improvements, OEE improvements and a lot of other things as well. Any sense on what\u2019s more important here? Is the supply chain driving the bulk of that 2 points in the next 2 or 3 years? I mean any sense there? And do we need some heavy lift restructuring to achieve those targets?\nBill Brown: So thanks for the question, Nigel. I don\u2019t think I can say much more on the insurance recoveries or how much we are getting, I mean, other than what we\u2019ve captured to-date. So I think we\u2019ll update you on that as we go. We expect that to ramp a bit better. But look, when I step back, I mean look at $13 billion worth of cost of goods, half of that is going to be roughly is supply chain. So you\u2019d expect the bigger parts of our productivity is going to come out of supply chain. We have seen restructuring benefits flow through in our factories. That is also a factor. We continue to drive lean activities on our factories and you are seeing the benefits of lean production, lean operations across our factory network. We are seeing benefits in our transportation cost and our logistics expense as running through our distribution centers. Last time, I spoke quite a bit about the amount of waste we generate in our company. It\u2019s \u2013 or yield loss, however you want to characterize it, 5% of cost of goods. So it\u2019s quite substantial. We are getting at that you are not going to get big, big dollars every year. You get it in tens of millions and chunks over time. But we are at it. We are running kaizen events continuously to go get it. We\u2019ve more than doubled the number of kaizen events this year over last and we expect that to continue going into next year. So, all of these pieces will drive that net productivity. The teams are at it. We are pushing hard. I would say stepping back the biggest part is going to come out of the biggest part of cost base, which is supply chain.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Bill, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe Anurag, congratulations on the new role, just wanted to maybe get a bit more color on 4Q, especially it looks like 1% organic growth very much on trend, but it looks like the 4Q margins coming in about 20.5% at the high end, quite a big step down Q-over-Q. So just want to make sure that\u2019s the right math and any below line color would be helpful?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Great. Thanks a lot, Nigel. I think you covered it. The Q4 margins are pretty much in line with what we expected. Sequentially, Q4 has been lighter than Q3 margins by about 300 to 350 basis points due to seasonality, which translates into lower sequential revenue of about $200 million, lower under absorption in the factories due to shutdowns, inventory management and timing of cost and investments. So overall, it\u2019s pretty much in line with what we expected. But if you kind of take a step back, we raised the bottom end of the guide by $0.20 or the midpoint by $0.10 and that is largely because of the focus on productivity. We have seen good, really good progress on that. Plus the share \u2013 benefits of share repo and the higher cash flow generation, which is leading to a higher interest income or lower net interest expense. So putting all of that together, making progress across all these areas and Q4 pretty much in line.\nOperator: We will go next now to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.\nJeff Sprague: Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone and welcome aboard, Anurag. Hey, I just wanted to come back a little bit in the neighborhood of some of these earlier questions. Predominantly, I just want to get a sense of the fact we are kind of at the tail end of the prior restructuring. I think you did $165 million of spending in the first half and had something like $110 million to go in the second half. So I am trying to get a sense if that is still on track? And then, Bill, of these very numerous and granular things that you are laying out here, are we seeing much benefit from that in 2024 or is this really sort of laying the groundwork for 2025 and a lot of the margin expansion in 2024 is really the underlying prior restructuring plan?\nBill Brown: Hey, Jeff, it\u2019s good questions. I mean, first, on the restructuring, we are on track. Your numbers are right, $165 million in the front half and about $110 million or so in the back half of the guidance, so $275 million for the year. That\u2019s about where we are at. And there is a little bit more that will tail into next year to complete the program. And yes, some of the gross margin and net margin improvements this year coming from restructuring, they are coming from a lot of productivity programs that have been in flight, some are ramping up and have more focus and effort in the last 5 or 6 months, but a lot of these things are going to be realized over time. This is a football metaphor. It\u2019s a couple of yards and a pile of dust in lots of ways to get ground game going on operations excellence. It\u2019s a multi-quarter, multi-year journey. So the way I look at this, I think we\u2019re still, Jeff, in the early innings of becoming operationally excellent. And I think the bulk of the opportunities are ahead of us, which is why I think as I look out the next 1, 2, 3 years, we should continue to see margin growth coming out of a lot of what\u2019s happening across our factory network. There is a lot of levers to pull. There is no big winners, no big hitters here that drive a big one-timer in a particular quarter, but it\u2019s getting better at all of these things every quarter, quarter after quarter, and then extending that sort of philosophy on operational excellence across the rest of the enterprise. There is no reason why being good and reducing waste and improving throughput doesn\u2019t extend to how we run R&D, how you run a legal function, HR function, finance. And I think when you do across the whole enterprise you really start to become a much better company. And I think between now and then, we\u2019ve got a lot of room to go and a lot of opportunity ahead of us.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Understood. And then just thinking about kind of the capital deployment question, you stepped up on buyback a bit in the quarter in spite of writing a sizable liability check. How should we think about just managing kind of the outflow of cash on repo and/or dividend against the backdrop of sort of the schedule of liability payments? I mean maybe it\u2019s kind of a question about what\u2019s the comfort level on minimum cash or something like that as you are operating going forward?\nBill Brown: So I\u2019ll start, and this is Jeff, and I\u2019ll turn over to Anurag, as the new CFO to offer his thoughts, because I know he has been putting a lot of time on this. But yes, I mean, we did step up here in Q3 on repurchases. It\u2019s at about $700 million. It\u2019s $1.1 billion year-to-date. Look, we are generating good cash flow. We don\u2019t see on the horizon going out through next year big liability payments that aren\u2019t already on our balance sheet. So we\u2019ve got an opportunity to deploy capital. I think we were smart in doing that here in Q3. We have got capacity. We ended Q3 with a pretty hefty cash balance. Our leverage ratios remain pretty attractive. We\u2019ve got an open authorization from the Board. So look, we took advantage of that here in the third quarter. We\u2019ve got more capacity to do more. And so I feel pretty good about where we stand today. But maybe Anurag, as the new CFO, can comment on his thoughts on just the strength of the balance sheet.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Sure. Jeff, I really believe that our capital structure is actually solid from a cash balance, leverage, cash flow generation and optionality perspective, which allows the optimal capital deployment and allocation. As Bill mentioned, we have a very hefty \u2013 good cash balance. We ended the third quarter at $7.3 billion, which is more than 2x of the working capital requirements of the business. On leverage, it was a net leverage of 0.8x at the end of the third quarter, and more importantly, maintaining a strong investment grade rating with ratings of A3 or A minus. And as we\u2019ve seen through the quarter and the course of the year, the cash flow generation has been robust. For the first 9 months, we generated $3.5 billion of cash flow and that\u2019s after investing $1.7 billion on R&D and CapEx. And we do expect in years to come the cap \u2013 as earnings grow, we make progress in working capital, especially in the area of inventory, this will increase our cash flow and keep the conversion higher than 100%. Also, we have optionality in terms of the 19.9% stake in Solventum and any other future portfolio reshaping we do. So putting all of that together, it\u2019s a strong capital structure. We have optionality, flexibility to invest in the business to drive growth and also to return capital to shareholders. So, that\u2019s an active discussion we\u2019re having and we\u2019ll probably come more about it, talk more about it over the next few months.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Appreciate the color. Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next now to Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks. Good morning and welcome, Anurag. Maybe, Bill, a lot of very good color on the \u2013 some specific sort of tools around driving operational excellence, but maybe trying to tie it together, I think at a conference for about 6 weeks ago or so, you talked about getting gross margins for 3M into the high-40s. Right now, you are sort of 42-ish or so rate, including some charges. So is the right way to think about the medium term, maybe sort of 400 or 500 points of gross margin uplift on the sort of total enterprise level? And then operating expense inclusive of SG&A and R&D, that\u2019s sort of staying relatively stable in the low-20s as a share of sales as you sort of squeeze out more efficiency and returns from the R&D?\nBill Brown: Yes. So Julian, it\u2019s a good question. We are running kind of in the low to mid-40s right now and gross margin in the 43%, 44% range, plus or minus. There are points in time in the past where we were high-40s. That\u2019s excluding healthcare. So in our \u2013 the way we have our business structured today, it\u2019s certainly achievable. As I laid out sort of the math there and earlier in this conversation, $13 billion worth of cost of goods, if we do 2% net productivity, it\u2019s more or less $260 million. If we did it every year, it\u2019s sort of a point a year of gross margin. Of course, there is lots of dynamics here. You\u2019ve got mix happening in the business. You have new products coming in. We have got kind of, as next year, middle of next year as we exit PFAS manufacturing. You have some under-absorbed costs within those factories we\u2019ve got to take care of. Eventually, Solventum is going to move some of their production away or in the TSAs will wind down. We\u2019ve got to absorb that. So there is going to be lots of puts and takes. So it won\u2019t be a linear journey over the next number of years, a growing gross margin. But I do see that that\u2019s a big focus of ours. We have got to be really pushing that hard to drive gross margin improvement over time. Our R&D level is about 4.3%, 4.4%. I mean it could drift up, it could drift down a little bit in the tens of basis points, it\u2019s not in \u2013 or tens of basis points, it\u2019s not a big mover. SG&A could see some leverage over time just based on volume. But I think the bigger driver in the future is going to be coming out of gross margin. And I remind you, I am focusing on growth and margin expansion for sure, working the pedals across both of them. But as I step back, driving growth is also a margin driver because of a high drop-through we get on incremental volume. So that\u2019s kind of the way I see the future playing itself out. I don\u2019t think today, I\u2019ll get much more specific. We\u2019ll lay this out a little bit more clearly to investors as we turn the corner in \u201825 and come back and host an Investor Day towards the end of February. I think we\u2019ll have a little more clarity in laying this out a lot more clearly to investors at that point. But anyway, that\u2019s the math as I see it today, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And just circling back on your top line comment just there, so you\u2019re moving at about sort of a point of organic growth through the second half year-on-year, just wondered how you\u2019re looking at the overall sort of demand environment into next year? And when we think about the netting off of NPIs picking up versus your pruning efforts about 100 points this year, how are you thinking about the net of those two items over the next 12 months?\nBill Brown: Well, look, 1% organic this year isn\u2019t what we should be aspiring to. Again, it\u2019s the middle of the range we set a couple of months ago. It\u2019s traveling in the order of where the market happens to be. IPI is running around 1%, 1.1%. It\u2019s 1.2% for the year, steps up a little bit going into next year. GDP in the 2.5%, 2.7% range. Again, that\u2019s kind of in the same line next year. So it\u2019s low single-digits. And I think overall, we are performing kind of in line with that, including auto build, semis, electronics, all this consumer, all that together, trending in line. I look at NPI, and as that matures, early good signals were up 10% on numbers of launches this year over last. We see that rate accelerating 25%. But stepping back, we\u2019re still in order of magnitude less than we were at the peak days in terms of how many products we\u2019ve launched in the marketplace. So we\u2019ve got to get that R&D engine moving again. That is going to be essential to improving on our growth rate and starting to hit and then outgrow the market. That will start to bear fruit into next year, maybe the end of next year and into \u201826. And that\u2019s why it took a lot of care last time and earlier to say we have got to get better at selling what we have on the market today, which means we got to work our sales force and all those pieces of it. Do we have gaps in our sales force coverage? Do we have the right incentive structures, the right training, the right people in the field, the right distributors? Are we pricing correctly? Do we have cross-sell opportunities? All of these things will drive growth. And I think we\u2019ve got to pull all those levers. And it\u2019s why I came back earlier on in this conversation, it really doubled down on OTIF, because we are losing business if we are not delivering it on-time in-full to customers. We know it. We see it every single day. So that is the nearest term lever we can pull is getting better on on-time in-full. And as I step back and you put all that stuff together and turn the corner into \u201825, we should see better growth. That would be my expectation. But it\u2019s not going to happen overnight. These efforts do take some time and we\u2019ll lay this out a lot more clearly to investors as we turn the corner into \u201825.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nBill Brown: You bet.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next now to Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.\nNicole DeBlase: Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys.\nBill Brown: Good morning.\nNicole DeBlase: Maybe just a little bit more on some of the portfolio review comments you made at the beginning, Bill. I guess any thoughts on like what types of businesses could be considered non-core? And if there is anything chunky coming or if these are all kind of like smaller divisions or businesses that you are looking at?\nBill Brown: Yes, Nicole, thanks for the question. Look, I mentioned last time, I did it very purposely that we are going to take a fresh dispassion and look at the portfolio, as you would expect, I would do coming into this new company. But let me step back, I mean, the lens that I am looking through is a strategic lens at the moment to think about the portfolio. And it\u2019s really on where we can leverage technology in innovation to differentiate to win at the customer interface. When it came to 3M, it\u2019s very clear to me, very clear to all those 6,000 people that have been here that technology is what differentiates 3M. People join the company because of innovation. So I am really looking through a lens of can we leverage investments and the capabilities we have in material science and technology to make something different versus competitors and solve the need that others can\u2019t. And that\u2019s the lens that I am really looking at here. So we have a few businesses that are small. If and when we transact on them, you won\u2019t notice it in the overall report. There are a couple of points of revenue. So, it\u2019s relatively small, but it\u2019s a start. It\u2019s the things that I thought were near term and the ones that we could take advantage of today. But our evaluation continues. Again, as I turn next year, we come up in front of investors. I am expecting that I\u2019ll be standing in there talking about a matrix, which has something looking like what parts of our portfolio perhaps don\u2019t fit to us over time. And at the same time, it\u2019s not for today, but looking at what other things do belong with us that aren\u2019t currently owned by 3M. So, it\u2019s a pretty holistic assessment. We are in the very, very early days, Nicole. But a couple of deals that we are pushing on right now, early stages, but it\u2019s the direction we want to head in over time.\nNicole DeBlase: Okay, got it. That\u2019s clear. Thanks, Bill. And then maybe just on the business trends, what did you guys see in China in the quarter and any thoughts on 3M\u2019s ability to benefit from stimulus activity happening there?\nBill Brown: So, China for us is a pretty good size market. It\u2019s about 10% of our sales. Year-to-date, we are up about 11%, more or less, a little bit higher than that in the first half, a lot of it driven by automotive, up mid single-digits here in the third quarter, pretty much in line with, I think, where the market is in China. So, we feel pretty good about what\u2019s happening there and a lot of it is driven by automotive. Roughly half of what we do in China is for export, export out of the country and roughly half stays within China. And both are performing reasonably well. We will see as we get into next year, the outlook for the overall economy, we can read where the GDP happens to be forecast for next year. But there is a lot of stimulus activity, a lot of conversations around geopolitical issues we\u2019ll see as we turn the corner where China is going to be. But we are bullish on the economy there. We are bullish on our team there, our ability to compete. We have more than 5,000 people on the ground, 7 factories. And I think we have a good ability to be a strong participant over time in China.\nBruce Jermeland: Hey, Nicole. Nicole, just to quickly clarify, the strength has been in electronics in China, not automotive. All-in, we are up about 11% year-to-date. Ex-electronics were up roughly about 3% organically.\nNicole DeBlase: Thanks, Bruce. I will pass it on.\nBruce Jermeland: Yes.\nOperator: [inaudible]\nSteve Tusa: Sorry, didn\u2019t come through very clearly. Can you hear me now?\nBill Brown: Yes, we hear you, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Sorry about that. Anurag, thanks, congratulations and looking forward to working with you here. Just wanted to delve into price a little bit more in this algorithm of productivity and gross margin, where does price play into that? And are you expecting to get back to that kind of a positive margin price cost spread going forward?\nBill Brown: Well, it\u2019s a good question. I mean this year, we are seeing positive price. It\u2019s about half our organic growth, more or less, plus or minus 5% or thereabouts. We are covering material inflation this year. We are back to where we were kind of pre-pandemic level. It\u2019s a little bit higher than that in \u2013 during pandemic, because, obviously, inflation was spiking there. But as I step back on this, we should get pricing, particularly as we drive new product introductions and bring differentiated products into the marketplace. We do expect that. I see it in two pieces. I think one is we have an opportunity to get better at more surgical pricing, so pricing to volume generated. I made a comment last time that we\u2019ve got some opportunities to tie volume rebates, discounts, et cetera, to price. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019re working very, very hard on. as well as tightening down on what we call gross to net, and all the pieces between that volume discounts, market development funds, rebates, those kinds of things, that could be quite substantial. And I think we\u2019ve just had a better opportunity to get pricing. But as I look forward into next year, we should continue to be able to cover at least the material cost inflation in our price.\nAnurag Maheshwari: And just to add to \u2013 just to add to that, Steven, as Bill mentioned, our price should cover cost and inflation for us via inflation on the cost going forward. The one way to kind of think about the margin expansion moving forward, clearly, volume is the biggest driver for us in terms of operating leverage that we have, and the net productivity that we are driving. So, volume in that productivity should be the critical margin expansion drivers.\nSteve Tusa: And that you view price cost as separate from that productivity, I would assume?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes, correct.\nSteve Tusa: In the bridge?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes.\nSteve Tusa: So, then I am just wondering like if you got all of these kind of like good guys going your way and assuming like the economy doesn\u2019t like go to hell. What is the \u2013 like, R&D is flat, you should get SG&A leverage? You are talking about this productivity, price cost is not a headwind like what is the headwind to margins going forward? Like what\u2019s the negative?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes. So, the negative is essentially inflation that we will see over there, which is a wage inflation moving forward. But besides that, you shouldn\u2019t see anymore, of course, FX is there, which we don\u2019t know which way that could move. But if you look at overall margin even for the year, right, it\u2019s basically four pieces. It\u2019s a quarter of volume, a quarter of the restructuring cost, that \u2013 look, which came down lower compared to last year, it\u2019s a quarter of the TSA reimbursement and a quarter of net productivity. If you go into next year, there will be a little bit lower on the restructuring cost charges. But again, it\u2019s going to be more volume and it\u2019s going to be more on the productivity side with the biggest headwind being on inflation and potentially FX. It depends which way it goes.\nSteve Tusa: Sorry, one last one, how much is labor as a percentage of your costs again?\nAnurag Maheshwari: Labor as a percent of our cost is close to $10-ish billion, yes. $8 billion to $10 billion, yes.\nSteve Tusa: $8 billion to $10 billion, okay. Alright. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: We will go next now to Andy Kaplowitz at Citi.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey. Good morning, everyone.\nBill Brown: Good morning.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Could you give us a little more color into your consumer business? I think you talked about that it\u2019s getting a bit better. Could you elaborate on what you are seeing there is I think that business tends to be first-in first-out in the historical cycles. And I know you are focused on pricing in that segment, maybe that segment could be the most competitive in terms of pricing. Can you make the pricing improvement you need in that segment?\nBill Brown: So, on consumer, we were down about 3% in the first half, down about 70 basis points in the third quarter. But keep in mind, it has about 230 basis points of headwind associated with some of the portfolio prioritization efforts that the team is working on. And if you go back Q1 to Q2 to Q3 and then head into Q4, it\u2019s becoming less negative in terms of organic growth and it\u2019s trending to perhaps be positive in the fourth quarter. For the full year, down low-single digits, for the overall, it\u2019s mostly a USAC business, a USAC retail business. So, USAC retail sales is down about 50 basis points, for the year, down about 80 basis points. So, it\u2019s sort of trending in that \u2013 in the line with where USAC retail sales happen to be. When you look at the parts of the portfolio in the quarter, we had pretty good growth in our Command Strips home improvement. The Command Strip business, that was up is partly due to some new product introductions in that space and that they are performing pretty well there. The other the parts of the portfolio were a bit weaker, were flat to down. So, they offset the positive trend in home improvement. But we see good improvement trends going into the fourth quarter. It all depends upon what happens in holiday season as we get through the next couple of months. But the trend line is moving up in terms of its organic growth rate.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Helpful. And then Bill, maybe just stepping back, you have talked a lot about growth through innovation. But how far are you pushing 3M as to focus their innovation on maybe what I would call the right markets because it strikes me that there are just a few big global markets that are driving growth right now.\nBill Brown: So, yes, we are spending a lot of time thinking about where we spend our precious $1 billion in R&D for sure, and making sure it\u2019s going after the right areas as part of our overall governance process and how we are developing our strategic plan. To focus on those markets where we have a right to win, where we can actually earn value, we have a strong return on investment in the spaces. And look, the team is pushing on this, and this is a big focus of mine, a big focus of the team. So, more to come on that, but it\u2019s certainly part of the lens and the calculus that we are looking at and where we are spending the \u2013 or investing our R&D dollars.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Thanks.\nOperator: We will go next now to Brett Linzey with Mizuho Securities.\nBrett Linzey: Hi. Good morning all and welcome to Anurag. Just wanted to come back to the rationalization efforts, so I think it was a point of drag in the quarter, a point for the year, perhaps just isolating rationalization and leaving out some of the new product launches and other growth, should we be thinking about another point of headwind next year as you continue the simplification efforts, or is it something less as we proceed and advance forward here?\nBill Brown: No, Brett, it should be declined substantially going into next year. I mean we will lap the year, so there will be a little bit of drag on effect for things that happen in the course of \u201824. But we shouldn\u2019t see significant headwind from portfolio or geographic prioritization going into next year. Our intention \u2013 Anurag haven\u2019t talked about this, but our intention would likely be to not speak so much about that in our \u201825 results. It\u2019s something that really people do companies do just at a normal practice as you continue to look at your portfolio. And you add something, you take some things out, you replace things. And I would expect that going into next year, to be less part of our conversation than this year.\nBrett Linzey: Alright. Makes sense. And then just a follow-up on NPA and the launching of the new products, 10% growth next year. Just wanted to better understand the associated costs and where those introductions are aimed at the segment level. Should we be thinking of a commensurate level of R&D step-up, or are you able to achieve this with repurposing the spending base?\nBill Brown: No. So, it\u2019s within the existing spending base. As we go into \u201825, we will come back and talk more about where we see R&D. But a couple of things were happening. One is just it\u2019s a shift within where we spend our R&D. Really, it comes in kind of three buckets. I mean, it\u2019s about a third that goes into corporate research, longer term horizon things, basic technologies, there is kind of a third that\u2019s incremental line extensions, new product introductions. There is a third that that\u2019s going after cost reduction, PFAS fixes all those kinds of things. So, there is going to be some shift that\u2019s going on between those pieces. That middle bucket used to be around 40%, it dropped below 30%, that piece is coming back up. It\u2019s now above \u2013 it\u2019s now around a third around 32%, 33%. But that middle bucket on new products, new product line extensions is where we are shifting money to drive new product introductions. To be clear, the number of new product introductions this year in \u201824 is up 10% over last year, and we expect that, that 10% will accelerate in 2025 through those pieces I just mentioned a couple of minutes ago. The large part of our investment in new product introduction is going to be mostly in our safety and industrial business and transportation electronics business. There is some that goes into the consumer business. You will see more going into next year. You will see more introductions coming out of new product investment. But the lion\u2019s part of it is really in those other two businesses, and that\u2019s where a lot of the launches that I talked about a minute ago were occurring. We will share more information as we get into next year, not just the numbers, but where we are investing, what verticals we are investing, where we are going to prioritize our spend in the future and why, why we think we can win, and we will lay that out very clearly with investors as we get into February.\nBrett Linzey: Great. Congrats on the performance. Thank you.\nOperator: We will go next now to Joe O\u2019Dea with Wells Fargo Securities.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: Hi. Good morning. I wonder if you can elaborate a little bit more on the operating equipment efficiency comments you made. And when you talked about 50% utilization, well short of best-in-class just in terms of any clarification of what kind of best-in-class would look like as well as what your targets are over, call it, the next 6 months or 12 months there?\nBill Brown: Sure. Yes. Look, operating equipment efficiency is really \u2013 it\u2019s a fundamental metric. Companies that do manufacturing have implemented this over many, many years. It\u2019s a relatively new concept. We have 38 large factories, it\u2019s about 75% of our volume. And about 140 \u2013 about 80% of the assets that were in those factories, we implemented OEE. I mean you can implement it, but actually build it into the way the machine runs, it will take some time to do that. So, it\u2019s not a manual process, that\u2019s actually built into the way the machine runs. And look, if it\u2019s running 50%. The reality is we should be running, best-in-class companies are in 80% range or north of that. So, we are well short of that. So, the implication of this is that, first off, what\u2019s driving that underutilization, is it a lot of changeovers because that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s idled capacity, is it poor maintenance practices and the machine is down, is it volume or capacity, but it\u2019s sort of fundamental to figuring out how do you handle surge volume. And longer term, once that metric gets matured, and we come back and talk about a more holistic look at our network and the complexity we have in our network, it will allow us to say, well, where can we consolidate sites or cells or assets in our factories based on the utilization that happens to be out there. It\u2019s also more than theoretically possible, you were spending a capital for capacity expansion, yet, we are running 50% utilization on certain assets. So, longer term, we should also be looking at this as a way to make sure we are spending capital in the right places. So, it\u2019s really fundamental. We are started. We have got a metric \u2013 measure for where we have been year-to-date. And it will mature as we get into \u201825, probably it will be 80% done by as you get to the second quarter of next year. But it\u2019s a fundamental way of looking at how you are performing. And I am really proud of what the team has done in the last couple of months to drive that into our factories.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: And then also just wanted to ask on electronics demand trends, I think you commented that organically up high-single digits. So, earlier in the year, some spec in tailwinds, but it seems like still growing at a good clip as you move later into the year. And so any color there whether what you are seeing is trending with the market, if you are seeing any sort of share gain or taking advantage of pricing opportunities out there with the electronics growth.\nBill Brown: Yes. So, the electronics was up pretty good. Year-to-date in the quarter, we did have some back-end wins. I think we are growing at slightly higher than the market. We are watching pretty carefully what happens in the holiday trends here and what happens in the fourth quarter going into next year. So, we are pretty pleased with where we have been so far. It comes from a lot of the sophisticated films that we have created that are going into a variety of electronic devices. They are very sophisticated things, multilayer optical films optical adhesives, things that allow LCDs to look like OLEDs in terms of screen performance, gives you privacy and other things that you can then extend into the larger screens, larger displays in cars. That\u2019s what drives our Auto-E business. So, it\u2019s a pretty important technology. It\u2019s allowing us to perform well in electronics as a whole. So, we like the trends. We are watching what happens in the holiday season, and we will see what happens going into next year. So, doing pretty well, actually in semiconductors as well, it\u2019s \u2013 we are growing way above the market. That\u2019s been a pretty important trend for us this year, doing pretty well in data center, is not a big part of our business at the moment, but pretty pleased with that. But specific to electronics, outgrowing the market, and it\u2019s because of the spec-in wins and technology we have.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning everyone and welcome, Anurag. Bill, I think you mentioned earlier that you were honing in on redesigning your forecasting and demand planning across, I think two of your businesses. I am just curious like what are some kind of initial thoughts on improvements you think you can make? And then why not focus a little bit more holistically across the entire portfolio at this point?\nBill Brown: Well, this will eventually go across the entire portfolio. But like stepping back, we are sitting there where we are not delivering to where we want to be on-time and full to customers. We are proud of where it\u2019s gotten too, but it\u2019s not where it needs to be. So, we have got \u2013 we are not delivering on-time, yet we are sitting on 100 days of inventory at the same time. And so how do you fix this, and we are looking at the assets in our factories, on average and the ones we are measuring at running at roughly 50% utilization across the largest ones. And you run that calculus and there is something wrong in this whole value chain. And then go back to supplier. Supplier is delivering on-time and full to us. We are running in the low-60s now in the low-70s, but that there is a ring, it\u2019s an average. So, it\u2019s below 50% to up to 80%. And what\u2019s happening is it\u2019s just how you manage the flow through that supply chain. And it starts with the front end of it. It starts with the demand signal. So, what are we using to tell the factory what to produce at a SKU level, and then how does that translate based on stock on hand to what you tell the suppliers to do based on their OTIF performance, the lead time on logistics. This whole chain has to work incredibly smoothly because it\u2019s very complicated. So, it really comes back to this fundamental of what is that forecast demand signal. And the reality is, as we dug into it in a couple of divisions where we struggled with on-time and full, our forecast accuracy is not very good. So, there are analytical tools that are available that we are starting to look at. It takes some time to implement them. You have got a data cleanse, you have got to look at what are the right parameters you ought to be building into the model. Is there a manual overlay or not based on unique circumstances having for a SKU. That whole process has to run well. And if your forecast accuracy is not good, you cannot run your factory very well. Your inventory will be high, your suppliers won\u2019t perform, your logistics providers won\u2019t be available. So, it has to run like a smooth running clock. And it\u2019s clearly, we have opportunity to do better here. As we refine the model, yes, we will roll that out through the rest of the business, as appropriate. But this is really looking at two big divisions where we need, really high degree of focus early on. So, it will roll out over time as we get success here.\nJoe Ritchie: Yes. That\u2019s super helpful, Bill, in detail. I am curious, do you think that by February, you will have some kind of sense for what type of opportunity this presents for the organization?\nBill Brown: Yes. Look, we will certainly know by February, the results of the couple of divisions, were in there big divisions, not like small pieces. But we can estimate from that, we could probably estimate what\u2019s going to happen as we roll it out to other divisions. So, yes, we can sort of lay out a lot more, where I think you want to go, which is it\u2019s nice to talk about forecast accuracy, but tell me a little bit about how it\u2019s going to affect delivery performance, cost performance, inventory level. And I think we can kind of connect the dots on this as we get further mature in this particular area, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. Good. Thank you.\nBill Brown: You bet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Snyder: Thanks for getting me in here. Bill, on the last call, you talked about how you believe the business should be growing in excess of GDP. And I think to a prior question, you talked about better growth maybe into the back half of \u201825 and into \u201826. So, is that just simply a function of the investments that you guys are making in innovation that\u2019s going to allow you to start outgrowing the end market and it just takes time, or is there also an assumption that maybe the consumer just the served end markets get better into the back half of \u201825 as we kind of see that pickup in growth?\nBill Brown: So, Chris, our crystal ball is not going to be any better than what the various prognosticators out there are looking at in terms of what happens with industrial production, GDP, consumer behavior. I look back at the end of last year for what was predicted on IPI this year, and I think it was predicted 1.7, 1.2. So, I am not sure these indicators are all that powerful to predict what might happen in the market or the macro year out or 1.5 years out. Look, first off, we got to grow with the market, and I think we are doing a good job with doing that, in this year at about 1%. As I said last time, and I think at your conference, the 1% is not where we want to be, to actually grow that and be performing better. Without putting a timeframe on it, it comes into these two levers. One, we have got to get this R&D machine running. As I mentioned then, I will say it again today. That\u2019s going to take time. Our development time \u2013 our development cycle is a year or more on developing and commercializing launching a new product. So, there is a timeframe that that\u2019s going to take to turn that piece around. But there are some initiatives that we have got to get at today, and that\u2019s a lot more aggressive this at the customer interface, selling, pricing, these other things, which has a near-term effect. When you put all that stuff together, is it growing at GDP or more than that, we will describe that more over time. I want to sort of walk before I run here and that\u2019s kind of where I am standing as we speak today, Chris.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Yes. And just to add, right, we have grown three quarters consistently 1%. As Bill said, we will give more color as time goes by over there. To Steve\u2019s question earlier, we said we can grow operating margin at a pretty healthy clip given all the levers we have. As we go into next year, as you are aware, we do certain headwinds from higher pension expense, lower interest income. Of course, we mitigate that through share repurchase, but that\u2019s a $0.30 headwind that we see from below the line items. But if I kind of look at what\u2019s we have driving in terms of all the discussion we just had around the factory, the supply chain, looking at the indirect cost and all the productivity along with that, along with the tailwind, we can see with the reduction in restructuring charges. It gives us confidence to expand operating margins next year while driving top line growth, and we will give more specific details this year.\nChris Snyder: Appreciate that. And then if I could just follow-up on maybe some of the portfolio pruning. Is it fair to assume that whatever business the company decides to leave, they will get paid for it? Not \u2013 no more organic exit or at least nothing very sizable in terms of organic exit? I understand maybe certain SKUs or product lines can come and go.\nBill Brown: Yes. Look, I think there is going to be, over time, natural portfolio pruning in terms of SKUs. As you bring new products on, it may obsolete other things that need to go out. That churn, that part of \u2013 that\u2019s a normal part of business, and that should all be sort of absorbed within your normal organic growth contributions that we should be growing at the market for. So, that is \u2013 as you just pointed out, Chris, a distinct from a selling business, which we are going to look at that\u2019s on an inorganic exit. We will look hard at cash effects, dilution effects, all those pieces. We will make sure we get paid more value for that business than we would have assumed today within 3M. But I think your question was really on organic. And as I turn this year, like I said, I think we will probably talk less about kind of the portfolio shifting that going all up inside the company on SKUs and geographies and things like that, so.\nChris Snyder: Appreciate that. Thank you.\nBill Brown: You bet.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for fitting in, and welcome to Anurag.\nAnurag Maheshwari: Thank you.\nDeane Dray: This came up in the local paper, but it would be interesting to hear your thoughts on the challenges you are facing, both operationally and culturally, to get the 3M employees back to the office. You all have been fully remote for longer than most companies. I know you have announced some initiatives, but would love to hear some color there.\nBill Brown: Well, so look, I mean it\u2019s \u2013 we need to grow our business. We need to innovate. Part of that is, we need to solve problems for customers. I do think that your problem solved, innovate better in person. We are going to maintain flexibility in our workforce. What we have done is for our largest sites at our most senior people, we have asked those individuals to be on the site wherever they report on Tuesday through Thursday with some flexibility on Monday and Friday. This is an opportunity for us to continue to build our culture, build our relationships, problem solved as a team. And I think it\u2019s the right step. I know a lot of our customers have moved in this direction in the past. Maintaining some flexibility in our workforce is really important to me. It\u2019s important to our employees, and we are allowing that. But it gives us an opportunity to be able to look across the table from one another and really dig in and problem solved in a better way than I think you can over Teams or Zoom or some other format like that. So, that\u2019s why we are leaning in a little bit more on bringing people back at sort of \u2013 at our larger sites including here at 3M Center.\nDeane Dray: Got it. And then just a last question, a lot of discussions today about new product introductions, efficiencies in R&D, will you be bringing back the new product vitality index? Is that one of the measures and 3M had at one time, but then went away from it? What\u2019s your thought there?\nBill Brown: No, I am happy to talk about it. I know there was reasons why we pulled away from it. We don\u2019t want to get that to be oversold or built into a comp metric or whatever. But the reality is it\u2019s an important metric, because we have pulled back from introducing new products to the marketplace, we know that. I talked at some detail as to how many NPIs have come down over time and where we are at last year, going up 10% this year. The net effect of that is our product portfolio in the marketplace is aging, for sure. Our NPVI on a 5-year basis is running just over double digits, 10%, 11%. We used to be 25%, 30% for the more super innovative companies that are in that range. I am not going to say when we get back there, but it\u2019s one that\u2019s on my mind. We need to have more fresh offerings on the marketplace, so we ought to be better than low double digit in terms of Vitality Index. And I am happy to talk about that over time in terms of the metric, what\u2019s happening to it, why I think it\u2019s important. But I don\u2019t want to overuse it with investors or here with employees because there is lots of other metrics, of measures that drives are we becoming effective at driving innovation in the company. That just happens to be one of them.\nDeane Dray: Thank you.\nBill Brown: You bet.\nOperator: And this concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Bill Brown for some closing comments.\nBill Brown: Well, thank you very much to all of the analysts for joining today and asking a number of very, very good questions. I want to importantly thank all 3M-ers for their dedication, their hard work on behalf of our customers and our shareholders throughout the quarter, throughout the year, and I look forward to speaking with all of the investors as we get into late January issue our Q4 results, and in late February, probably the last week of February as we host an Investor Day likely here in Minneapolis. Have a very good day, everybody. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

Welcome to the 3M Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded Friday, July 26, 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\nBruce Jermeland: Thank you, and good morning, everyone and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Bill Brown, 3M's Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our President and Chief Financial Officer. Bill and Monish will make some formal comments, then we'll take your questions. Please note that today\u2019s earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the home page of our Investor Relations website at 3M.com. Please turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today\u2019s conference call, we will be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note, throughout today\u2019s presentation we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today\u2019s press release. With that, please turn to Slide 3 and I'll hand the call off to Bill. Bill?\nWilliam Brown: Okay, thank you Bruce and good morning everyone. This morning we reported second quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.93, up nearly 40% with 1% organic revenue growth. Adjusted free cash flow was $1.2 billion with conversion of 109%. I'd like to thank the 3M employees for all their hard work in delivering solid second quarter results. Monish will provide further details on the quarter and then I'll wrap up our prepared remarks with guidance for the year before opening the call to Q&A. I've now been in the job for nearly three months and have been busy visiting a number of our factories and labs, as well as taking a fresh look at our strategy and how we're executing against it. As you know, 3M has been undergoing a lot of change in the past few years following COVID, most recently with a successful spinoff of the healthcare business executing on a significant restructuring effort and working to mitigate risks, including discontinuing PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025 and settling legal matters. You've also seen a number of changes to our organizational model, shifting from a geographic to a global business unit structure and centralizing our global supply chain activities under one senior leader. Collectively, this has been a massive transformational change for 3M, and the team has executed really well. As a result of these efforts, you're seeing the benefits in operating margin expansion, strong cash generation, and a solid balance sheet with low leverage ratios and an incrementally more positive view from the rating agencies. Credit to Mike and Monish for their steady hand in guiding the company through these changes. But my job is to look forward and while much progress has been made, we have more to do including navigating PFAS related matters where fortunately we have a strong, terrific team managing the exit and our ongoing legal matters. As I see it, we're still in the early innings of our operational excellence journey and we haven't yet cracked the code on organic growth, which I know is essential to creating shareholder value. So my top priorities are; number one, driving sustained top line organic growth; number two, improving operational performance across the enterprise; and number three, effectively deploying capital. On the first priority, I believe that the company has significant organic growth opportunities as we participate in end markets with favorable secular trends and have a strong foundation and long history in material science innovation. However, as you well know organic growth has been below market indices and peers over several years and up only about 1% year-to-date. Driving sustained organic growth requires both getting more out of R&D, as well as improving commercial excellence. As I've gotten into the details, what I've learned is that ex- Solventum R&D investment for core 3M, which is running about $1 billion per year, or about 4.5% of revenue, has been flattened nominally over the past five years and down on a real basis as the focus was on investing in and strengthening the healthcare business. And within the lower spend, the amount we invest on new product development has declined even further as the company shifted more dollars to efforts to exit PFAS manufacturing and work to reduce supply chain cost and resolve COVID related sourcing constraints. As a result of the decline in investment, along with a strategic shift to fewer, but larger innovation opportunities, the number of and revenue from new product introductions has steadily declined over the past decade. The simple fact is that our products are aging. While we've been shifting our portfolio towards higher growth markets like auto electrification, industrial automation, data centers and semis, climate tech and others, these efforts aren't material enough today to offset erosion in our core. They remain, for the most part, attractive growth platforms, and we need to continue to balance investing appropriately in markets that are evolving quickly, while also investing incrementally to sustain the core products we have today. But before we make any adjustments to our R&D budget, I want to first explore opportunities to get more from what we currently spend. For example, improving the velocity of our new product development process and increasing the effective capacity of our engineers by eliminating bottlenecks and non-value added work, and over time, redeploying those currently working on PFAS exit activities to growth initiatives. With enhanced data transparency and a more coordinated governance process, we can improve R&D effectiveness by deploying resources on the highest return projects. These efforts are essential to reinvigorating the 3M innovation machine, but will take time to bear fruit. So in the near-term we have to focus on commercial excellence to sell more of what we currently offer, and that means better sales force and distributor effectiveness, targeted marketing, optimized pricing, and much better execution at the customer interface, in particular, on time, in full performance, which is a key part of my second priority, operational performance. We have a terrific Ops leadership team in place, executing on a number of opportunities, and I want to give you some color of what I'm seeing so far. I've been looking at our manufacturing and distribution network to understand our global supply chain and distribution capabilities. I see opportunities to reduce complexity, drive lean manufacturing and logistics, improve supply chain management, lower yield loss, and increased service levels with lower inventory. While our network of 110 factories and 95 distribution centers have historically served 3M well, it is incredibly complex and interconnected, with most SKUs we produce touching multiple factories before reaching the customer. For example, a command strip touches five factories and two distribution points before it hits the store shelf. This extends cycle times, increases goods in transit, and drives up logistics and freight costs. In lean manufacturing and logistics, we're developing a consistent metric around operating equipment efficiency or OEE, to increase equipment utilization and rein in capital spending and mapping modes and flows to lower freight and distribution costs. In supply chain, we have significant opportunities to improve our sourcing effectiveness. We have more than 25,000 direct and indirect suppliers, including nearly 4000 contract and component manufacturers, yet more than 80% of our raw materials are sole sourced. We haven't been holding our suppliers accountable to the same quality and delivery standards as our customers hold us to, and we're only beginning to leverage our scale to reduce cost. Relative to yield loss, our raw material waste is running close to 5% of cost of goods sold, due in part to how we design and manufacture our products, but also due to inefficient production scheduling and changeovers. And finally, we have too much inventory at about $4 billion in 102 days at the end of Q2 and yet our service levels are only in the mid-80s. Our bottoms up analysis indicates we should be closer to 75 days of inventory or lower, which would imply about $1 billion cash opportunity over time while we drive on time in full above 90%. My third priority is effectively deploying capital, and our approach remains the same as it's been investing in R&D and CapEx to fund organic growth, paying an attractive dividend which we just recalibrated with the spin of Solventum, maintaining a strong balance sheet and using excess capital for M&A or share buybacks. We repurchased about $400 million in stock in the second quarter and have the capacity to do more in the second half and next year. While no acquisitions are on the near-term horizon, I'll be taking a fresh, dispassionate look at our portfolio to determine if any assets have greater value owned by others, and along the same line, what assets might be a good fit for 3M. I don't have anything further to say on that today, but you can expect to hear more from me regarding portfolio prioritization as I deepen my understanding of our businesses and end markets. So for the past three months, it's been pretty busy with a lot still to learn. I think we have a good foundation to build upon and believe that this focus on fundamentals, back to basics approach will drive value creation. I'm encouraging everyone at 3M from top to bottom to every day challenge the status quo and the way we've done things in the past, to act with speed and urgency and to off-board those things that distract us from growing, innovating and executing for customers and shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Monish to cover the quarter and I'll come back to discuss guidance. Monish?\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you, Bill and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 4. I would like to take a moment to briefly remind you of a few items that we highlighted during last quarter's earnings call. Beginning with the second quarter, our results for business segment operating income includes prospectively the impact of dissynergies or stranded costs previously associated with Solventum. Therefore, for historical pre-spin periods presented, the dissynergies are reflected in corporate and unallocated. In addition, we added a new operating category named Other for Solventum transition service agreement activity. Other includes our Q1 cost associated with supporting the agreements for which 3M started to be reimbursed for in April. And finally, corporate and unallocated incorporates the commercial agreements between 3M and Solventum that started on April 1 and retrospectively picks up certain operations of the former healthcare business retained by 3M. Turning to our second quarter performance, we posted solid adjusted results, including sales of $6 billion, operating margins of 21.6%, earnings per share of $1.93, and free cash flow of $1.2 billion. We delivered adjusted organic growth of 1.2% or up 2.4%, excluding geographic prioritization and product portfolio initiatives. These results reflect the trends that we have previously discussed, including strong growth in electronics, mixed industrial end markets and continued softness in consumer retail discretionary spending. We had another strong quarter of execution with adjusted operating margins expanding 440 basis points year-on-year, and delivered adjusted free cash flow of $1.2 billion with conversion of 109%. Please turn to Slide 5. On an adjusted basis, we delivered operating margins of 21.6% up 440 basis points and earnings of $1.93 per share, up 39% versus last year's second quarter. Our second quarter year-on-year performance was driven by organic growth, productivity, strong spending discipline and restructuring savings which combined benefited operating margins by 310 basis points and earnings by $0.31 per share. In addition, income from the transition services we are providing to Solventum increased margins by 50 basis points and earnings by $0.05 per share. These benefits were partially offset by stock based compensation which was shifted into the second quarter due to the spin of Solventum. This was in line with what we discussed during our first quarter earnings call. This change in timing negatively impacted operating margins by 200 basis points and earnings by $0.18 per share versus last year's second quarter. Lower year-on-year restructuring charges were a benefit of 270 basis points to margins and $0.23 earnings to earnings. For the second quarter restructuring charges were $44 million, which were lower than anticipated. For the full year we continue to expect pretax restructuring charges in the range of $250 million to $300 million. Foreign currency was a negative $0.04 per share impact as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar. Acquisition and divestitures were a benefit of 10 basis points to margins and $0.03 to earnings year-on-year. This benefit is related to last year's second quarter reconsolidation of Aearo Technologies along with the commercial agreements between 3M and Solventum. Below the line items benefited earnings by a combined $0.14 per share. This benefit was primarily due to increased interest income year-on-year on a higher cash balance due to in part by cash proceeds received from the spin of Solventum. Taking into account our first half of the year performance, we now expect our full year non-operating expense to be in the range of $50 million to $75 million versus a prior range of $75 million to $100 million. A quick comment on corporate and unallocated and other before moving on to cash flow, Q2 corporate and unallocated sales were $86 million with a $2 million adjusted operating loss. Year-to-date, corporate and unallocated sales were $112 million with an adjusted operating loss of $73 million. This is in line with our full year anticipated sales range of $225 million to $275 million with a forecasted adjusted operating loss in the range of $125 million to $175 million. Our Other category had operating income of $37 million which reflects the level of activity and effort to support the successful spinout of Solventum. Year-to-date Other had an operating loss of $28 million which is in line with our full year expectation of flat to a loss of $25 million. Please turn to Slide 6. Second quarter adjusted free cash flow was $1.2 billion. Our second quarter performance was driven by strong operating income, lower CapEx spending partially offset by higher working capital. Adjusted capital expenditures were $250 million in the quarter as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. During the quarter we returned a total of $800 million to shareholders split equally between dividends and share repurchases. And finally, net debt at the end of Q2 stood at approximately $3 billion. These strong results build on our track record of robust cash generation. For the first half of the year we have generated $2 billion of adjusted free cash flow. Our strong capital structure continues to provide us the financial flexibility to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders and meet the cash flow needs related to legal matters. Please note that in the month of July we will make total combined payments of $3.7 billion related to the Public Water Supplies and Combat Arms settlements. Before I move on to our business segment performance, I want to highlight a couple of items for your awareness that were excluded in arriving at our Q2 adjusted results. First, note that we reached settlements of approximately $120 million with insurance carriers related to combat arms. We remain in discussion with multiple carriers and anticipate additional future recoveries. Second, during the quarter we incurred a non-cash charge of approximately $800 million related to a $2.5 billion pension risk transfer on a portion of our U.S. defined pension obligation with Met Tower Life. This action helps us to reduce risk and administrative fees related to our U.S. pension plan. Please turn to Slide 7. Starting with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.8 billion, up 1.1% organically. Industrial Adhesives and Tapes posted mid-single digit organic growth driven by strength in Bonding Solutions for Consumer Electronic Devices. Personal Safety and Automotive aftermarket grew low single digits. Electrical markets was up slightly while roofing granules was flat due to unplanned customer manufacturing challenges. And finally, we experienced year-on-year organic sales declines in Abrasives and Industrial Specialties. Geographically, industrial markets grew low single digits in the U.S. and Asia Pacific, while EMEA was down low single digits. Overall, industrial end market demand continued to be mixed in the quarter as end user and channel remained cautious. Adjusted operating income was $623 million with adjusted operating margins of 22.6%, up 40 basis points year-on-year. This performance was driven by higher sales volume benefits from ongoing productivity and restructuring actions and lower year-on-year restructuring charges. These benefits were partially offset by the timing of stock based compensation and cost inefficiencies due to the spin of Solventum. Moving to Transportation and Electronics on Slide 8, which posted adjusted sales of $1.9 billion, or up 3.3% organically. Our electronics business outperformed the market up low double digits organically as we continued to gain spec in wins on consumer electronic devices and in semiconductor manufacturing. Our auto OEM business increased nearly 5% in Q2 versus a 0.5 point decrease in global car and light truck bills. Looking at the first half of the year, our auto OEM business was up 9% organically versus a flat global build rate of cars and light trucks as we continued to gain penetration on new platforms. Looking at the rest of Transportation and Electronics, advanced materials grew mid-single digits organically and commercial branding and transportation was down low single digits year-on-year. Transportation and Electronics delivered $426 million in adjusted operating income, up 16% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 22.3%, up 250 basis points year-on-year. The team achieved this result through strong leverage on electronics volumes, ongoing benefits from productivity and restructuring actions, and lower year-on-year restructuring charges. Partially offsetting these benefits were the timing of stock based compensation grants and cost inefficiencies due to the spin of Solventum. Turning to Slide 9, the consumer business posted second quarter sales of $1.3 billion. Organic sales declined 1.4% year-on-year with continued softness in consumer discretionary spending. This included a 2.7 percentage point impact from portfolio and geographic prioritization. Home Improvement grew mid-single digits, Consumer Safety and Wellbeing grew low single digits, Packaging and Expression declined low single digits, while home and auto care declined mid-single digits organically. Geographically, the U.S. was up slightly, Asia Pacific was down mid-single digits and EMEA was down high single digits. Consumer second quarter operating income was $219 million, down 7% compared to last year with operating margins of 17.4%, down 80 basis points year-on-year. Operating margin performance was driven by lower volume and timing of stock based compensation grants along with the cost inefficiencies due to the spin of Solventum. Partially offsetting these headwinds were benefits from lower restructuring charges. Before I turn it back over to Bill, I want to take a moment to thank the 3M team for the tremendous progress they have made positioning the company for success. I am very proud of the relentless focus our teams have brought to create value by driving performance through our improved productivity and efficiency, spinning out of our healthcare business and reducing risk and uncertainty by managing legal matters. I am confident that under Bill's leadership, the team will continue to build on this momentum to create consistent value for our people, our customers and our shareholders in the years to come. I would also like to thank all the analysts and investors for our rich discussions and engagements over the last four years. With that, please turn to Slide 10 and I will turn it back over to bill for an update on our guidance. Bill?\nWilliam Brown: Thanks Monish. Given the strong operational execution in the first half of the year, we're raising the bottom end of our full year adjusted earnings guidance by $20 to a range of $7 to $7.30 versus $6.80 to $7.30 previously, now up 16% to 21% year-on-year. Full year adjusted operating margins are now expected to be up 225 to 275 basis points. Full year adjusted organic growth remains unchanged at flat to up 2% with expectations for second half organic growth in line with first half performance at the midpoint. While significant macro uncertainty remains, our business segment and market trends are largely playing out as expected. Year-to-date Safety and Industrial organic growth is approximately flat versus a full year expectation of flat to up low single digits. We expect that industrial end markets will remain mixed as channel partners and end customers continue to remain cautious on overall demand trends. On an adjusted basis, transportation and electronics is up nearly 5% organically in the first half versus a full year expectation of up low single digits. Strength in the first half was due in large part to consumer electronics along with automotive. We continue to monitor auto build rates along with consumer electronics demand trends for the back-to-school and holiday season. And finally consumer is down nearly 3% organically through the first half of the year versus a full year expectation of down low single digits. We continue to expect that consumer retail discretionary spending on hardline goods to remain muted in the balance of the year. Before we'd open up to your questions, I would like to take a moment to recognize and thank Monish for all his contributions and impact on 3M over the past four years. While I've only had a short time working with him, he has been a strong partner and has helped me get up to speed on the company, and I've enjoyed working with him. I appreciate everything he has done to navigate through a number of challenges and to make 3M stronger along the way. With that, let's open the call to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJeffrey Sprague: Good morning, everyone. Hello, Bill and Monish. Thanks for all the help up unto this point. Hey, Bill, thank you very much for that very thorough and detailed kind of deconstruction of the history on organic growth and the like and I appreciate your comment that it will take some time to kind of get after these things, but are you actioning some of these ideas already? Can you give us a sense of how some of these changes on the front end of the business as it relates to organic growth may be kind of put in action?\nWilliam Brown: So good morning, Jeff, and thanks for the question. So as I mentioned in my remarks, there are two major thrusts here on driving organic growth. One is certainly to spur innovation and driving innovation to turn the top line up, drive organic revenue. And so part of it is, we've got to sort of bottom out on how much we're spending on new product development and start to turn the ship. The first half of this year we launched about 75, 76 new product introductions. This year we'll do probably less than 150. And as I reflect back over the last eight or nine, 10 years, at one point in time we did over 1000. So we've really got to turn that around. It's going to take some time to do that. We continue to invest some of our precious R&D dollars on cost reduction and PFAS exit, stabilizing our supply chain. I made a comment about 80% of our raw materials coming in a source. We've got to qualify other vendors to be able to reduce costs over time. So that's going to take some time. What I'm really working on as well in R&D is ideas for how we can offload non-value add activities from our researchers. It really comes in two, three themes. One is both efficiency as well as effectiveness. I think there's an opportunity to drive effective capacity of our engineering team. I think we have an opportunity to drive velocity through the new product development pipeline. We have an opportunity to think differently and how we govern differently on R&D, where we place our precious dollars so that they can move across the company to the highest ROI investment. So that's what I'm focused on, on R&D. But again, it's going to take a little bit of time. So we've got to sell more of what we have on the market today. That's simply commercial excellence. I'm digging into a number of different factors. We've got a sales force today it's just over 5000 people. We know over the last four or five years it's down about 25%. That's partly because of the export model we've moved to. But we have an opportunity to take a look at our coverage, our incentives, our training around our sales force. I think there are some opportunities there. We distribute to almost 30,000 distributors. I think we have opportunities there. There are probably some opportunities in pricing at a high level. We've done a very good job at the covering inflation and we'll see some incrementally positive pricing this year. But when you get down to a granular level there's some disconnects between pricing and discounts and margins to the volume or size of the customer and we have an opportunity to take a harder look at that. We're looking very hard at advertising and merchandising. It's a lever that's important in our consumer business. We were down quite substantially from where we were before relative to consumer packaged goods type companies, we're down. So we have an opportunity to think differently and very tactically around advertising and merchandising. I think lastly we're looking at cross selling. There are certain examples, certain places where we sell products into a distributor or into a customer, but those customers, they should be buying a different product from us, but they don't. For example, for customers that do surface by surface conditioning products to polish metals and woods, you always use a respirator to do that. You want to look at our customers. There's a bunch that don't buy the respirators from us, so there's an opportunity there. All of those things are levers that we're going to be pulling here in the short-term, Jeff and we'll keep updating analysts and investors as we learn more about how do we really drive the top line, which is so crucial to driving value creation at 3M.\nJeffrey Sprague: Great, thanks for that and maybe just one other quick one. Well maybe it's not a quick one. I appreciate the detailed answers. On kind of the operational excellence side of the equation and a lot of these KPIs that you're speaking to on delivery quality and the like, does this require sort of a heavy lift on restructuring? The company's gone through a lot of restructuring recently, including just coming to the end of a big program or do you kind of view these as just more kind of process improvements and things of that nature?\nWilliam Brown: So you're right. We've been through and are actually getting through a very substantial restructuring program, about 75% complete. It will drag into 2025. I think the team is executing very well on that. A lot of the things I'm talking about in terms of improving OpEx, they're incremental pay-as-you-go type of opportunities. You almost get the savings as you're covering investment. There are potentially over time some bigger bites. If you think about the complexity of our broader network, a few years out there could be additional restructuring, but can't size it today. Right now, the opportunities that I'm seeing are almost pay-as-you-go. Reducing waste and inefficiency in factories are things you can do and just execute against without substantial charges to get there.\nJeffrey Sprague: Great. Thanks and good luck. I appreciate it.\nWilliam Brown: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe: Oh, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hello, Bill. It's been a while and I wish you good luck.\nWilliam Brown: Thank you, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: So I think you might well have answered my question, but I do want to just kind of ask about the plants and the distributions at the footprint. I think you mentioned 105 plants and 95 DCs, 110 plants and 95 DCs. So are we talking here about, over time, a significant shrinkage in that footprint, or is it more a reconfiguration to reduce the complexity of the product velocity around that network? And then thinking about the opportunities around sort of investing to drive growth versus efficiency, how should we think about margins beyond 24? Are you confident we can still grow margins beyond 24, even though it sounds like you're going to be investing?\nWilliam Brown: Okay, so a couple of good questions, and I'll try to hit on them pretty quickly. You're right, 110 factories, 95 distribution centers. The fact is, if you go back in time, the team here has actually been reducing the number of factories, the number of DCs in our network, and there's some inflight in the restructuring program we have today. Looking forward, we don't think we necessarily need 110. I can't decide what it exactly is and when that cadence might happen, but we're taking a hard look at it. But it's not just factories, it's also cells within factories. When you look at what we have in assets and cells within these factors, we have 250 coating assets that are spread almost through half of our factories. And you have to sit back and ask, as we drive operating equipment efficiency, do we really need all those assets in all those factories, or do we have an opportunity to increase effective capacity. So these are things that we're working on. Peter Gibbons and a team are doing a great job at this. This is going to happen over time. I can't really size how many factors of the restructuring that's required to get there. Relative to margins, the team has done an outstanding job. You can see in the first half of this year, up almost 500 basis points. So the margins have come up quite substantially. We've got more we can do here in terms of just basic blocking and tackling productivity. Volume clearly, as it comes back, volume clearly is going to be a high leverage ratio for us. So where they can go from here, I can't size it today. Certainly, as we get to the balance of the year into 25, we'll give you some more outlook on that. But there's lots of levers here, including driving organic volume.\nNigel Coe: Great. Thanks Bill, that's great color. And then Monish a quick followup on the insurance recovery. That's obviously great news on the Combat Arms recovery. Can you just disclose how many carriers are you negotiating with on Combat Arms? And maybe just bring us up to speed in terms of what's the opportunity within the water settlement? A - Monish Patolawala Yes, so Nigel, as you know, there's a tower insurance here, so we are dealing with multiple insurance providers. We were pleased with what Kevin Rhodes and the legal team have done on getting the 120 this quarter. And as I've mentioned in my prepared remarks that we believe that there is more to be had here and we'll definitely keep you all informed as these things happen.\nNigel Coe: Okay, that's great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning, Bill. Welcome, Bill and we'll miss you Monish.\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you, Scott.\nScott Davis: Good morning Bruce, too. Bill, is your -- I don't want to read too much into this, but is it your view that 3M is just too diversified and needs to kind of narrow down even a little bit more than what we've already seen with the Solventum spin?\nWilliam Brown: Well, I'm not sure I would say that today, Scott. In fact, as I think about it, it's a big business, a complicated business, a lot of different end markets, different business segments, different ways of going to market. A lot of the stuff that we make goes across all of these factories. So there's a lot of interconnection across the business. But as I've done in my past, I'll do the same thing here, which is take a fresh, hard look at what businesses that we're in. And as Mike said in my prepared remarks, dispassionately do that. Really look hard at what is better owned by us and we'll make some determinations over time on that. At the same time as we think about the kind of business that we want to be in over time, are there assets that aren't owned by 3M that are better owned here? And we'll take a hard look at that piece there as well. So I wouldn't draw any specific conclusion from my remarks other than we're going to take a hard look at it. And if we determine that something is better owned elsewhere, then we'll move forward in that. It's all about value creation for owners.\nScott Davis: Fair enough. And I guess when I looked at your list of priorities, operational excellence, all these things are kind of basic. I don't want to minimize, but this is, it almost feels like you're walking into a situation where a lot of things weren't done right. And I don't want to point fingers, but just point being is, what was the fail? Was it just compensation and kind of where people's priorities were placed and you need to change a compensation plan? Was it just that a lot of these things like lean manufacturing were just not seated or seated early enough? I'm just trying to get my arms around. I have followed 3M for a long time and we've had a number of different CEOs who have come in and had kind of a similar tick list that we want to fix this, this and this, but have struggled to kind of get there. And I'm trying to just get my arms around, what do you think was the main fail that kind of led us to where we are today? And is there kind of one main thing that you can kind of tick the box first and work on kind of through the list? I know that's a little bit of a tough question, and again I'm not trying to point fingers, just saying that it's a pretty heavy lift. I think some of these things, a lot of people try pretty hard to fix, thanks.\nWilliam Brown: Look, I'll just say it's not about fail or success or right or wrong. I come in with a different set of experiences, different background, fresh look at the way we do business from the things that I've done in the past. I think the team here has done a marvelous job in managing through a lot of complex situations. I was a CEO of a company through COVID, and what we dealt with is well short of the challenges that 3M has faced, and you bring on top of that, a lot of the liabilities that Mike and the team have managed through, the structural changes. There's been an enormous transformation effort. And as I said, they launched the restructuring program. We're 75% complete. It's gone very, very well and you can see that in the margins. That's gone very well. I come in, I just look at it the way it is today with sort of looking at the cold hard facts, and it's a back to basics focus on the fundamentals approach does sound \"basic\", but at the end of the day, I do think that there's a lot of value that can be created from the raw materials that we have here. Just focusing on just how do you turn the business to top-line growth through the things that I've talked about, commercial excellence, driving growth from R&D, and driving a real culture of operational excellence through the company, and move at these things with speed and with urgency. I've been in situations like this before. It's easy to fall into a trap of this is the way things have been done. And as I said in my remarks, I'm encouraging people to challenge the way we've done things in the past every single day. That's what continuous improvement is really all about, and that's what I'm encouraging people to do. So I'm looking from here forward and I see a great opportunity for value creation.\nScott Davis: Fair enough, Bill. Best of luck.\nWilliam Brown: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks very much. Welcome to Bill and Monish, thanks for all the help down the years. May be just the first question around the reinvestment point and organic growth, so Bill it sounds as if you can reinvest sufficiently in the business in the medium term to get growth moving, but still see reasonable margin expansion. I just wanted to confirm that that is what you're saying. And then on that growth rate point, I wondered sort of what your initial thoughts were on the growth entitlement for 3M. Maybe what you think it's addressable. Markets are growing at, how you view the growth rate of its aggregate peer set. Just the context I suppose is 3M has grown around 1% to 2% the last five to 10 years ex-Solventum. I wondered what you thought the market growth rate was versus that?\nWilliam Brown: So a couple of good questions. I mean first, we do expect that we have some capacity in the back half to incrementally invest in the business. I think Monish and Mike have talked about this in our guidance model. We still see some opportunities to incrementally invest. We'll talk more about where that might be in the back half. But we always said with the savings that we're generating from restructuring, some of that savings would be reinvested back in the business. That's been the case so far and we see some additional opportunities in the back half of the year. My comments around sales force, my comments around advertising, merchandising, at least a couple of different items. I can't say much about R&D today. I want to look harder at how do we free up capacity of the investment we make already today, and can that be more streamlined and redeployed effectively on top line growth? And that's really a big focus of mine. In terms of entitlement growth, certainly we should be growing better than we have and we were guiding 0% to 2% midpoint of 1%. We know there's 1% headwind because of exiting certain geographies and parts of our portfolio, but still on an adjusted basis, 1% to 3% organic. It probably should be a bit more than that. GDP is in the 2.5% range. IPI we think this year is around 1.7%, 1.8% or thereabouts. We should be growing at least at the level of the economy, if not perhaps slightly better. But more comments as we get towards the back end of the year and into 2025, give you some longer term outlook for where the company might go.\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. Thank you. And then just may be toggling back to the short-term as a lot has been asked about the medium term, if we're just thinking about the sort of framework for the second half guidance, I think it's implying an operating margin in the second half of maybe 21% or so. A little bit better perhaps, and that's fairly flattish year-on-year and half-on-half. I just wondered if I had that right, because it looks like restructuring charges are shrinking year-on-year and half-and-half and the top-line is pretty steady. So I just wondered if that was the correct assumption and any drivers behind that and if there was any preliminary thoughts on sort of third versus fourth quarter dynamics here?\nWilliam Brown: So, yes, let me offer a couple of comments here and I'll ask Monish to maybe fill in a little bit of the blanks on the quarterly progression. But you're right in terms of the cadence here. We do expect revenue to be very similar in the second half to the first half, and that does reflect historical trends. We continue to see strong operational execution and spending discipline just like we saw in the first half. We'll see some tailwinds from the benefit of lower restructuring cost, which is now 60/40 first half, second half. Last time it was 70/30. So some has shifted to the back half, but you do see a bit of a step down. And we do see reimbursement of transition services agreement with Solventum, which began in April, but at the same time we have higher wages in the back half of the year. We have two full quarters with a wage increase. Our wages went out on April 1, so not in first quarter but in the second, so that's a bit of headwind. That's offset by some lower stock comp. As you know, we made our grants here in the second quarter. We do see some headwinds in our factories. We built inventory through the second quarter that caused some positive absorption. We'll see inventory coming down in the back half of the year. That's going to cause some negative absorption or some headwinds there and then some higher non-operating expenses driven by pension and higher interest costs. We had a lot of cash balance here in the second quarter. Cash went out the door in July for some legal payments, legal settlements. So our interest costs, interest expense is going to go up. Our interest income will come down in the back half of the year. And then of course, as I mentioned before, we do see some step up in some investments we have in the back half of the year. So those are the biggest drivers. A little bit of tax geography, but those are the biggest drivers. Maybe I'll ask Monish to comment on Q3, Q4 cadence.\nMonish Patolawala: Sure. And just Julian, to add on to Bill's points on first half, second half, just data points. We spent $165 million in the first half on restructuring, and at the midpoint that would be another $110 million in the second half. So the tax rate will be around 19% in the second half versus 20% in the first half. If you now go to just the guidance between 2Q, 3Q or 3Q, 4Q, 3Q revenue trends will be very similar to what we saw in 2Q. I think Bill already talked about what it looks like in the market, so that's where the team is seeing right now. I would say continued strong operational execution and spending in 3Q also. You will get a tailwind from the timing of stock comp, which we announced in 2Q, approximately 100 of it that comes back as a tailwind in Q3. But at the same time, as Solventum matures in its ability to execute independently, we also believe that they will keep exiting their TSAs. As I've told you, the TSAs, some are short-term, some are as long as two years. That could go up to three years. We will see lower fees as Solventum begins to exit. And that's an impact of approximately $0.09 from a headwind on an EPS perspective, which is overall still in the range 2Q was heavier than 3Q and 4Q. Bill talked about the seasonal impact in our factories as we bleed down inventory in Q3. Restructuring costs based on what the team sees right now is flat Q2 to Q3. So the balance will go into Q4 as we talked about. And then you will see -- we talked about $0.11 EPS impact for the second half on Combat Arms and PWS. As you know, we have made payments. By the end of July we would have made $3.7 billion of payments under our agreements under the settlements under Combat Arms and PWS, which means you have a lower cash balance in Q3, and that impacts us $0.06 of EPS. So between pension and interest costs, that's a headwind Q2 to Q3. The team continues to believe that they can step up to drive long-term growth, to step up investments. And then tax rate for the third quarter will be in the range of 20% to 21%. And the fourth quarter is, the whole year is, I mean, the second half is 19%. So you can back into the fourth quarter, which would be lower. Hopefully, this is helpful to get your models right.\nJulian Mitchell: That's great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Tusa: Hi, good morning and Monish, thanks for all the help. It wasn't always easy for you guys, but really I appreciate you being front and center with the details and always doing your best to give us visibility of things, so we really appreciate the help there.\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you, Steve.\nSteven Tusa: And Bill. My first question is, will you get any summer vacation at some point? Because it sounds like, I'm not sure I've ever seen a new CEO in the first three months be shot out of a cannon like this and have this kind of detail. You're usually supposed to wait for about a year so you can reset and get the options before you give the long-term target. So we really appreciate the detail here. It sounds like you've been busy. Just the elephant in the room, though. You talked a lot about capital allocation and I think the narrative obviously around PFAS is that there's negative optionality from the balance sheet, if you will, but that it's a drag. You're talking about being a little bit more on your front foot from that perspective. And the only place PFAS is mentioned is in the Slide 2, which is in the legal disclaimers. You didn't talk about it really at all in the slides. What's your take there? And do you have any perhaps pivot and strategy around PFAS in that liability?\nWilliam Brown: Well, thanks for the question. Look, first of all, we've got a great team of advisors, legal inside and outside that are managing PFAS and other liabilities. When I step back and look at just where we've been, the Public Water Supply settlement was a great step, important first step, really in managing some of the risks. But there's more to be done. We're continuing to manage litigation from some of the opt outs, other cases within the MDL [ph], there's Europe that's sort of hanging out there. We continue to control in that area. We've got very exhaustive disclosures in the Q and the K and again we have a great team that are really focused on managing that. Where I think I'm best putting my time are the things that drive value creation for our owners and that's driving the top-line and driving operational excellence in the business. We do generate great cash flow. We see it in the quarter. We saw the first half, 90% to 110% free cash flow conversion for the year. I've got ideas on how we can drive that further over time. We're at 0.3 leverage ratio. So when I step back, I think we actually have a very strong balance sheet. We can manage appropriately the risks that we see in front of us. And even through that, we have options here to do things with our balance sheet. So, I'm focusing on the things we can control and really getting the team pivoted back to what do we do to drive growth and operational excellence.\nSteven Tusa: What do you think the market is missing in its pretty harsh and negative narrative around this PFAS overhang from what you've heard?\nWilliam Brown: I can't really comment on what the market may or may not be missing on that, Steve. What I'm focusing on the things that we control. I read the Q very, very thoroughly, like all of our investors do. It takes a long time to get through it. I think we've done it. We do a great job at the disclosure there. But again, we've got a great team that's managing this. It's a dynamic situation and I trust what they're doing. I'm involved in that. Mike has been very helpful. He has a lot of expertise in this area because of the time he had to spend on it. I'm relying on him here as well. And again, I think where my time is best placed is what do we do to drive the other 64,000 of the 65,000 employees? What are they going to do to drive value creation? We've got a lot of people focused on PFAS. We have to get people focused back on the core things and what makes 3M great.\nSteven Tusa: Right. It's good to know you're reading the Q some time in your travels to sit back with a nice scotch and read the Q. Thanks a lot. Good luck and looking forward to connecting.\nWilliam Brown: Likewise.\nOperator: We'll take our next question now from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Obin: Yes, good morning.\nWilliam Brown: Good morning.\nMonish Patolawala: Good morning.\nAndrew Obin: Monish, thank you for all the help over the years. It's been a pleasure.\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Just a question on, just followup on capital allocation. It seems that with a lot more visibility on PFAS sort of operational focus, the market is clearly reacting to the message very positively. What are the thoughts about maybe front loading share buyback, particularly as you release working capital? Improving on time delivery, what is, and I know you sort of highlighted buyback as one of the key opportunities, but in transformational stories like this, buying stock at the bottom tends to pay off longer-term. What's your view and the view of the Board on buybacks? Thank you.\nWilliam Brown: Well, thank you. You're right. I was very purposeful in the four top priorities for capital deployment and number four was around excess cash for repos, or M&A. There's just not M&A on the horizon. So you saw a step into the market in the second quarter. That was under Mike and Monish's leadership, $400 million worth of buyback. We do have capacity. Our balance sheet looks very strong. We have an open authorization with our Board that's close to $4 billion. We keep evaluating this as we sort of manage the risks that happen to be out there, our ability to generate cash, drive down working capital in the back half. And through all those levers, we'll look hard as to what we do with excess cash in the back half as well as into next year. Nothing more to say about that today.\nAndrew Obin: Sure. And, historically 3M has been one of the companies that investors would buy, towards the bottom, towards the economic bottom as things reaccelerate. I guess, two part question. First, do you think 3M still has this cyclical leverage? Because you talked about your product introduction being down quite a bit, but generally do you think this fundamental quality of the business to really reaccelerate into improving industrial and maybe one day consumer fundamentals is still there? And B, second question is, how far away do you think we are from sort of industrial bottom? Because it just seems like there is no end. We just can, PMIs can find a bottom if, you know, if you could just sort of provide us with your view even when there is any visibility on things bottoming out. I know a long question, but I appreciate your answer.\nWilliam Brown: No. Good question. I mean, I do think, I do hope that we're bouncing along the bottom. It all depends on what happens here in the back half in the U.S. certainly and what the Fed does with interest rates and what's going on with inflation. There are a lot of geopolitical questions around the world. So I'm optimistic that the market is going to start to recover. But again, I don't have a crystal ball, like nobody on the call really does. So at the end of the day, I step back and I look at what do we do with the assets that we have. And I think about the long history that 3M has in core innovation, new to the world ideas. And I think as we reground ourselves back on that long-term mission, that culture, that spirit of innovation and we reignite that across the thousands of employees in this company that drive it every single day. To me, that's what I'm focused on. That's what I can control. There are lots of great markets out there. There are lots of different pockets of places where we can invest in to innovate, to penetrate, to grow, to differentiate offerings versus our competitors. So that's what I'm focusing my time on. The economy is going to do what it's going to do. I'm just watching where the trends happen to be and investing in places where we think we can drive some differentiation and grow higher than the market. So long answer to your question, but that's the way I think about it.\nAndrew Obin: I really appreciate it and look forward to working with you.\nWilliam Brown: Likewise, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz at Citigroup.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone.\nWilliam Brown: Good morning.\nMonish Patolawala: Good morning.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Monish, thanks for all your help. Bill, I look forward to working with you. So maybe, Bill or Monish, you mentioned that growth across your businesses has generally been in line with your expectations. But just focusing on transportation, electronics, I know comps get a little more difficult in Q4, but would you say there are some upside as your original low single digit growth forecast there? Do you see consumer electronics holding up in the second half and have you seen any improvement yet in semiconductors?\nWilliam Brown:\nTEBG:\nMonish Patolawala: No, same thing. I think we'll have to. Andy, as you know, this is cyclical, so we'll have to watch what happened in the second half. Bill mentioned that even in the prior question and that's what the team is watching. We are watching all the trends that all of you watch, which is build rates on cars, build rates on consumer electronics, what the holiday season turns out to be, I think, are all factors the team look. They watched in the past and will continue watching. And based on what we know right now, the team feels the guide that we have given you, which is for the company as a whole, is fair.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Helpful. And then Bill maybe can you talk about 3M's ability to price across its portfolio? When I hear the conversation regarding limited new product intros and R&D, obviously the thought is that can all impact price. So how structurally, how effective can you be and how fast in sort of impacting pricing? And then it's hard not to notice. Consumer, for instance, remains pretty muted. I think that is just the market, but is it particularly challenging to price in that segment?\nWilliam Brown: That's a very, very good question. From what I can tell last year, we had pretty significant price increases and we did cover inflation. This year in our sort of 1% center point of our 0 to 2 guidance, we have positive price within that. So we continue to see pricing. It's certainly lower than on a year-over-year basis than it was last year. So on a macro basis, our ability to price has been pretty good with capturing back inflation. But what I'm looking at is the more details around how we price by customer, by segment, by product, not just gross price, but net price. So discounts, market development funds, all of those things between gross and net price. And is there an opportunity at the real micro level to price better? My instinct is that there is an opportunity here and this is an area that I'm going to focus a lot of time and attention on that. Sometimes it's training, sometimes it is systems, sometimes it is data visibility. But there's an opportunity on a much more granular level. Take a look at how we price, and I'll know more in the next number of months and couple of quarters as we go through the analysis. But I do believe we'll find some opportunities do better job on pricing there. The other point you had mentioned about new product development, you're exactly right. Which is as we innovate and develop differentiating features, we should be able to get better margin and better pricing on those new products that are coming out. So as we reinvigorate the NPI engine, which I expect to do, hopefully that does drive price improvement, margin improvement, over time as well.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: I appreciate the color.\nWilliam Brown: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph O'Dea of Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nJoseph O'dea: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nWilliam Brown: Good morning.\nJoseph O'dea: In the interest of time, I'll just keep it to one. But Bill, just curious if you could expand a little on the dispassionate portfolio review comments. I understand sort of no specifics today, but if you could just talk about your timeline for completing reviews? And then as you do these, what are the key metrics that you ask business leaders to present on in the reviews as you sort of focus on decision making there?\nWilliam Brown: So good question and look, 90 days in the job, I'm trying to learn the business, learn, meet the team, understand what's going on in the business. So there's a lot that's happening right now and I'm really focused there. I'm not to the point of any particular occlusions, I'm not necessarily near that. But it is something that's on our mind. We're going to look hard at. The teams are looking at this as well, is how are we growing in each segment versus competitors. What's the earnings growth outlook? Are we able to expand margins or not? What does our NPI pipeline look like? And based on who we compete against, do we have an opportunity through better execution, through better operations, through new products coming down the path, to improve our positioning in certain segments. At the end of the day, we're an innovation driven company. Technology differentiation is the lifeblood of how we compete. So I'll be looking hard at businesses where we can bring technology differentiation into the business and provide value to customers that's different than our competitors. And I contrast that with commodity like businesses that perhaps don't really fit so well. So, no specific lens other than that, but we'll take a hard look at this and make some conclusions in the coming quarters next year as we get our arms around what's the business we should be in and also which businesses that we ought to be looking at outside the company.\nJoseph O'dea: I appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.\nWilliam Brown: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nBruce Jermeland: Joe, are you there?\nOperator: Mr. Ritchie, your line is open. Please proceed with your question. We are not hearing your question at this time. And Mr. Ritchie, please check your mute button. We are still unable to hear you at this time. Mr. Ritchie, please.\nBruce Jermeland: Operator, let's just move on.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question now from Brett Linzey with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nBrett Linzey: Hi, good morning all and welcome to Bill and best of luck to Monish.\nWilliam Brown: Thank you.\nBrett Linzey: Yes Bill, I appreciate the rundown on the priorities. I thought the example on the command strips was quite striking. As you're thinking strategically about optimizing some of these touch points, do you think you have the personnel resources internally, the incentive structure internally to drive these changes or are you looking to third parties? Just trying to understand the timeline and what needs to be done here.\nWilliam Brown: Oh, thank you. Yes, this is a -- it\u2019s a complicated problem. It\u2019s a lot of products, a lot of SKUs across a lot of factories and distribution points. If you look at this on a global basis, you map all the DCs and all the flows, all the factories, it's a spider's nest. I mean, it's a lot going on here. And we do have a great team in operations that are looking hard at this. We have outside advisors that have been involved and this will take some time. It's not a quarter, two quarters away. We'll continue to take a hard look at optimizing the networks and the flows. So, we have the right people at the top level and I do think that we've got the right incentive structures around this as well and motivations for the team.\nBrett Linzey: Okay, great. I appreciate the color. I'll leave it there.\nWilliam Brown: Okay.\nOperator: We'll take our next question now from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nNicole DeBlase: Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys, and welcome, Bill and thanks, Monish, for all the help. Maybe Bill, you could talk about the level of employee response and engagement. I suspect that you've probably been making a bit of a world tour in your first few months. All of this change sounds really exciting and would just love to hear how employees have been responding to what you'd like to do.\nWilliam Brown: Look, I think employees here are excited. They're engaged. They want to make a difference. They want to see 3M grow. They want to see share price come up. They want to see recognition for doing great things in the world and then developing new products. That's the message I'm providing to you today. That's the message I'm offering to our employees. My priorities as I have explained to you, is what I've explained in some more detail with employees in town halls. So I think it's resonating well. I think hopefully it's energizing people, but again, we've got a lot of strong people here who have been here for a while, that really want to make a difference and I'm appealing to that. So I think the response has been good so far, again 90 days in.\nNicole DeBlase: Thanks, Bill. In light of time, I'll pass it on and let someone else ask. Thank you.\nWilliam Brown: Thanks, Nicole.\nOperator: WE'LL take our next question now from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning and welcome Bill and all the best to Monish.\nWilliam Brown: Thanks, Deane.\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you.\nDeane Dray: Lots of impressive game plan in terms of all the different operational initiatives bill, and it just raises the question for me is, you can't do everything at once. So what's the element of triage? And also, this is not a one man show. Talk about your team. Are you deputizing internal folks? You have an army of consultants, you've got a CFO search you've got to do, and then how much change can the organization handle at once? Is there any element, I mean, lots of stuff needs fixing, but is there a sense of how you can layer these in and can change be too disruptive?\nWilliam Brown: No, it's a great question. I mean, look, these are all important priorities and I do think we can both try to drive growth through the mechanisms that I mentioned, as well as operational excellence. I think it's fundamental. I've been through this before. It's my first rodeo on these things. I can see a path to getting this work done. We have a great team of employees here. We have engaged outside advisors to help us across these different pieces and focus in some of these dimensions. Yes, it's a busy start, but I think we have the right team to deliver it. I think we have the right focus and priorities. We're going to have to manage it and manage the capacity of the team to respond to all these pieces, but yes, I'm optimistic. I think we'll look at these pieces individually as we go forward. I've laid out a pretty full laundry list of things we want to do, but we'll prioritize these things as we get towards the back end of the year. But at the end of the day, we're not going to be able to invest to grow unless we drive operational excellence. And I would say operational excellence is in fact a growth driver. When you're running, you are on time and out of your factories at mid-80s, 86 and change percent was our second quarter results. We should be above 90%. The fact is, when you're below 90, we're missing sales. So by getting our operations to run better, that is a growth lever. As we drive productivity in our factories and create savings there, that we can reinvest in growth initiatives, that's a growth lever. So I think you've got to do both of these two pieces at the same time and work the pedals and that's what I plan to do.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. I'll leave it there. I appreciate it.\nWilliam Brown: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question now from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies and Company. Please proceed with your questions.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. This is Kevin [indiscernible] on for Laurence. So I was just wondering if you could give a little bit more granularity on what you're seeing in terms of Chinese demand and whether you're seeing any green shoots there? And I'll leave it there just because of time.\nWilliam Brown: So thank you for the question. Look, China for us is about 10% of our revenue. We had a good first half. We're up about 13% in the first half and part of that is electronics. When you look at the piece that's sort of local for local, if you will, it's about 1% so flattish and pretty similar to what other multinational, maybe even a little better than what a lot of other multinationals are seeing in China. Again, it's about 10% of our business, an important market, and we've seen good growth in the front half of the year simply because of the consumer electronics and auto builds.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Bill Brown for some closing comments.\nWilliam Brown: Okay. Well thank you, everybody, for joining and participating today and for the thoughtful questions. I want, again, thank all 3Mer\u2019s around the world for their hard work and their dedication and I want to wish Monish well in his future endeavors. So thanks again for joining the call and I wish everybody a good day. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line at this time."}, {"symbol": "MMM", "quarter": 1, "year": 2024, "date": "2024-04-30 00:00:00", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded, Tuesday, April 30, 2024. \n I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. \nBruce Jermeland: Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our President and Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments, then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the home page of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. \n Please turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. \n Please note, throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release. \n Please turn to Slide 3. During today's presentation, Mike and Monish will discuss our total company Q1 2024 results, which are inclusive of the Health Care business and are on the same basis on which 3M provided first quarter guidance back in January. As we have mentioned, it is important to note that Solventum Corporation's separate financial reporting will differ from the basis of presentation used by 3M for the Health Care segment. \n 3M's full year 2024 earnings guidance initiated today is on a continuing operations basis, reflecting Solventum as discontinued operations for the full year, including the first quarter of 2024. In addition, we will be treating changes in the value of our 19.9% equity interest in Solventum as a special item in arriving at non-GAAP results adjusted for special items. \n And finally, we are providing additional financial information this quarter in our press release and slide presentation given the impact of the Solventum spin. We hope that you find the information useful in understanding our Q1 performance and outlook for 2024. We also plan on filing additional information on a continuing operations basis, including in late July or early August, Form 8-Ks with recast 2023, Form 10-K and Q1 2024 Form 10-Q information. \n Please turn to Slide 4 for a summary of our updated post-spin financial reporting framework. Beginning with the second quarter, Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics and Consumer business segment operating income will include the impact of the dis-synergies or stranded costs previously associated with Solventum. \n In addition, we have added a new operating category named Other for Solventum transition service agreement costs, which 3M will be reimbursed for beginning here in April. Finally, Corporate and Unallocated will incorporate the commercial agreements between 3M and Solventum that started on April 1. \n One final comment. In the appendix on Slide 27, you will find information on our Public Water Suppliers and Combat Arms legal settlements, including the pretax payment schedule by year and total combined pretax present value and after-tax estimates. \n With that, please turn to Slide 5, and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike? \nMichael Roman: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. \n In the first quarter, we delivered strong results that were better than our expectations as we returned to adjusted organic growth and achieved double-digit adjusted earnings growth. We improved performance across our businesses and in our operational execution. We also completed the spin-off of Solventum and finalized 2 major legal settlements. \n Our results demonstrate the positive impact of the changes we have made over the last several years. We've also made significant progress in executing our strategic priorities, which has positioned the company for long-term shareholder value creation. \n In the first quarter, on an adjusted basis, we delivered revenue of $7.7 billion, including improved organic growth, operating margins of 22%, up 400 basis points; and earnings of $2.39 per share, up 21%. \n On April 1, we successfully completed the spin-off of our Health Care business, Solventum, creating 2 world-class companies well positioned to deliver greater shareholder returns through distinct and compelling investment profiles. As independent companies, both 3M and Solventum are better able to tailor their capital allocation and investment priorities to win in their respective markets. \n I want to thank and congratulate the teams whose dedication made this major accomplishment possible and wish the entire Solventum team, led by CEO, Bryan Hanson, great success in the future. \n In Q1, we also finalized 2 major legal settlements. First, our settlement agreement with U.S.-based Public Water Suppliers received widespread support and participation. It was granted final approval by the court on March 29. We anticipate making total payments with a pretax present value of up to $10.3 billion over the next 13 years. The first payment is expected in the third quarter of 2024. \n It is important to note our agreement with Public Water Suppliers addresses the detection of any type of PFAS at any level. This includes PFAS that have already been detected or may be detected in the future, including those that are the subject of the U.S. EPA's recently announced limits in drinking water. \n Second is our settlement of the Combat Arms multi-district litigation. As of today, more than 99% of claimants have chosen to participate. This provides us the certainty and finality the settlement was intended to achieve. We anticipate making total payments up to a pretax present value of $5.3 billion through 2029. \n We also continue to make good progress on our exit of all PFAS manufacturing. We are on track to meet our commitment by the end of 2025 and are working closely with each of our customers to complete an orderly transition. \n In summary, the progress across all 3 of our strategic priorities has helped make 3M stronger, leaner and more focused on what we do best: utilize 3M science to make indispensable products for our customers. \n I will now turn the call over to Monish for more details regarding our performance in Q1 and to discuss our guidance for 2024. \nMonish Patolawala: Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. \n Please turn to Slide 6. We continue to build upon the strong foundation we laid in 2023. We remain focused on our priorities, and the team continues to deliver improving results. \n We posted strong adjusted results in the quarter, including sales of $7.7 billion, operating margin of 21.9%, earnings per share of $2.39 and free cash flow of over $800 million. These results were better than our expectations as we continue to drive strong operational execution and spending discipline. \n We also benefited from significant operating leverage, particularly in Transportation and Electronics, which was driven by strong organic volume growth in electronics and automotive. Our results also benefited from the acceleration of certain nonrecurring actions, which I will go through in more detail on the next slide. \n Our first quarter adjusted sales of $7.7 billion exceeded our expectations of $7.6 billion as we delivered improved organic growth, which was partially offset by a headwind from foreign currency translation. We delivered adjusted organic growth of nearly 1% or up 2.4% excluding geographic prioritization, product portfolio initiatives and last year's disposable respirator comp. \n Organic growth was driven by our Transportation and Electronics business as the team won share gains from spec-in wins and new product introductions with automotive and consumer electronics OEMs. This drove strong organic growth as the OEMs ramp production for new launches for end customers. \n Geographically, year-on-year strength in China and EMEA was driven by our strength in electronics and automotive. Sales in the U.S. were flat year-on-year with industrial and health care end markets showing relative strength, offset by consumer retail softness. \n Please turn to Slide 7 for details of the components that drove our year-on-year operating margin and earnings performance. As mentioned, on an adjusted basis, we delivered operating margins of 21.9%, up 400 basis points; and earnings of $2.39 per share, up 21% versus last year's first quarter. \n Our first quarter performance was driven by improved organic growth, particularly in Transportation and Electronics, along with a continued focus on operations, restructuring actions and spending discipline, which drove better-than-expected improvements in operating margins of 340 basis points and earnings of $0.42 per share. \n As disclosed in our Form 10-K and as factored into our 1Q guidance that we provided in January, our year-on-year margins and earnings were benefited from the delay of our stock-based compensation grants from a normal timing in the first quarter to the second quarter due to the Solventum spin. This timing adjustment added 140 basis points to margins and $0.15 to earnings per share as compared to last year's first quarter. \n We also accelerated certain nonrecurring benefits, including property sales as we progress on our asset-light strategy. This benefited first quarter year-on-year operating margins by approximately 70 basis points and earnings by $0.08 per share. \n We accelerated restructuring actions in the quarter, incurring pretax charges of $122 million, which was higher than our guidance of $75 million to $100 million. This compared to last year's restructuring charge of $52 million, resulting in a negative year-on-year impact to margins of 90 basis points and $0.10 to earnings. \n Foreign currency negatively impacted adjusted margins by 60 basis points or a negative $0.09 per share as a result of the strong U.S. dollar. This headwind was larger than we had expected. The reconsolidation of Aearo Technologies in Q2 2023 resulted in a $0.01 benefit year-on-year to earnings per share and was neutral to margins. \n As expected, our adjusted tax rate was 20.5% this year, which was higher than when compared to 17.7% in last year's first quarter, resulting in a $0.09 headwind to earnings. And finally, other financial items and shares outstanding netted to a positive $0.04 per share year-on-year impact. This benefit was primarily driven by interest income on proceeds from Solventum's issuance of $8.4 billion in debt prior to the separation, partially offset by a non-op pension headwind. \n Please turn to Slide 8. First quarter adjusted free cash flow was over $800 million. Adjusted free cash flow conversion was 63%, in line with our historical first quarter trends. We continue to focus on driving working capital efficiency, including improved cash conversion cycle times. I am pleased with the progress we have made, yet there remains significant opportunity to further improve performance in all aspects of working capital. \n Adjusted capital expenditures were $355 million in the quarter, down 20% year-on-year. The lower year-on-year spend is primarily due to nearing completion on water filtration investments at our manufacturing facilities. And finally, we returned $835 million to shareholders via dividends. \n Turning to the balance sheet. Net debt at the end of Q1 stood at $10.4 billion, a decline of 13% year-on-year, driven by strong free cash flow generation of our businesses. Also of note, in late February, Solventum issued debt of $8.4 billion for which the repayment obligation went with Solventum, while 3M kept approximately $7.7 billion in proceeds upon spin on April 1. These proceeds, combined with our business' strong and reliable cash generation, have further strengthened our balance sheet. In addition, the retained 19.9% equity stake in Solventum will provide additional future liquidity. \n Also, during the quarter, we retired $2.9 billion of debt. Our strong capital structure and robust cash generation provides us with the financial flexibility to continue to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders and meet the cash flow needs related to legal matters. \n Now please turn to Slide 10 for a discussion on our business group performance, starting with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.7 billion, down 1.4% organically. Industrial end-market demand remained mixed in the quarter. We delivered strong double-digit growth in roofing granules, driven by replacement demand and storm repair. \n Industrial Adhesives and Tapes posted low single-digit organic growth, driven by spec-in wins in new bonding solutions for consumer electronics devices. The Personal Safety business declined low single digits as strong demand for self-contained breathing apparatus for the first responder market was more than offset by year-on-year comp headwind from disposable respirators. \n And finally, we experienced year-on-year organic sales declines in electrical markets, abrasives, automotive aftermarket and industrial specialties. Geographically, industrial markets in the United States were up 1%, while China remained challenged. \n Adjusted operating income was $664 million, up 18% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 24.3%, up 410 basis points year-on-year. This performance was driven by benefits from ongoing productivity actions, timing of stock-based compensation and strong spending discipline. These benefits more than offset headwinds from lower sales volume and higher restructuring costs. \n Moving to Transportation and Electronics on Slide 11, which posted adjusted sales of $1.8 billion or up 6.7% organically. Consumer electronics end markets were stable in the quarter, while the semiconductor market remains soft. Our electronics business outperformed the market, up mid-teens organically year-on-year. The introduction of new products continues to be well received in the market, as evidenced by recent spec-in wins. In addition, we also experienced continued channel inventory normalization as electronics demand stabilizes. \n Our auto OEM business increased 13% in Q1 versus a 1% decline in global car and light truck builds. We continue to win increased penetration, including strong momentum in automotive electrification, which was up over 30% year-on-year in Q1. We also saw an increase in channel inventory at tier suppliers during the quarter given the forecasted 8% sequential increase in the auto OEM builds from Q1 to Q2. \n Looking at the rest of Transportation and Electronics, commercial branding and transportation grew low single digits organically, and advanced materials was flat year-on-year. While our Transportation and Electronics business is off to a good start to the year, we estimate that approximately 2/3 of the strong first quarter organic growth was driven by initial buy ahead by customers as they ramp production and introduce new products, along with channel inventory normalization. \n Transportation and Electronics delivered $479 million in adjusted operating income, up 68% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 26.3%, up 960 basis points versus Q1 last year. The team achieved this result through strong leverage on improved electronics volumes, ongoing productivity actions, strong spending discipline and the previously mentioned timing of stock-based compensation grants. Partially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from restructuring costs. \n Turning to Slide 12. The Consumer business posted first quarter sales of $1.1 billion. Organic sales declined 3.9% year-on-year with continued softness in consumer discretionary spending, which included a 2.4 percentage point impact from portfolio and geographic prioritization. Home Improvement and Consumer Safety and Well-Being declined low single digits. And Home and Auto care declined mid-single digits, while Packaging and Expression declined high single digits organically. \n We continue to invest in the business, including supporting successful new product launches, such as Command Heavyweight hanging products and sustainably focused Scotch-Brite cleaning tools and Scotch Home and Office tapes. Organic growth declined across all geographies. The U.S. was down low single digits, Asia Pacific mid-single digits and EMEA high single digits. \n Consumer's first quarter operating income was $216 million, up 21% compared to last year with operating margins of 19%, up 400 basis points year-on-year. The improvement in operating margins was driven by benefits from productivity actions, portfolio initiatives, strong spending discipline and the previously mentioned timing of stock-based compensation grants. Partially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from lower sales volume and higher restructuring costs. \n Finally, included in the appendix is a slide in the first quarter performance for Health Care. The business delivered results within our expectations with organic growth of 1% and operating margins of 17.5%. \n Now turning to guidance for the year on Slide 14. As Bruce mentioned at the beginning of the call, our full year 2024 outlook initiated today is on a continuing operations basis, reflecting Health Care as discontinued operations for the full year, including the first quarter. \n We have confidence in the momentum we have built throughout 2023. We continue to deliver strong results, including the first quarter, which was better than expectations. The guidance initiated today represents a return to growth, adjusted margins up 200 to 275 basis points year-on-year versus the illustrative midpoint of 18.7% for 2023 and over 15% earnings per share growth at the midpoint. \n We anticipate full year adjusted organic growth of flat to up 2% or up 1% to 3% excluding the impact from geographic prioritization and product portfolio initiatives we are taking. This estimated organic growth rate incorporates full year external forecast for major end markets, including an expectation of continued mix growth in industrial end markets. \n Automotive OEM build rates are currently forecasted to be down slightly. Consumer electronics are expected to grow low single digits for the year, while semiconductor market is currently forecasted to start the year slow and improve as the year progresses. And finally, consumer retail discretionary spending is expected to remain muted for the year. \n As mentioned, we expect a strong expansion in adjusted operating margins of approximately 200 to 275 basis points year-on-year, up from an estimated midpoint of 18.7% in 2023. With respect to adjusted EPS, we anticipate full year 2024 earnings in the range of $6.80 to $7.30 per share on a continuing operations basis or over 15% year-on-year growth at the midpoint. \n Turning to cash. Our businesses continue to deliver strong and consistent free cash flow. Our expectation is that adjusted free cash flow conversion performance post spin will remain in the range of 90% to 110%. \n Please turn to Slide 15 for more details on our full year guidance. Included in our outlook is for normal sequential patterns through the year coupled with the end-market trends just discussed. As a result, we anticipate that our second half of the year sales will be slightly stronger than the first half. Our expectations also include a 1% foreign currency headwind to sales given the strength of the U.S. dollar at current spot rates or a negative $0.20 to earnings per share. \n We also anticipate an approximately 75 basis point benefit to sales from the commercial agreement with Solventum. Please note that this benefit will be reflected within acquisition and divestitures from an external reporting perspective. \n We expect adjusted operating income and earnings per share to show relative strength in the second half of the year. This is primarily due to the impact from the timing of the Solventum spin on April 1, along with our pretax restructuring charges of $250 million to $300 million that are weighted 70% to the first half of the year. We will continue to benefit from productivity and restructuring actions, partially offset by increased investments in the business as we progress through the year. \n Looking at below-the-line items, we estimate full year other expense net will be in the range of $75 million to $100 million, mostly weighted to the second half of the year. And our 2024 adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the range of 19% to 20% with the first half of the year coming in at the high end of the range. \n As Bruce mentioned earlier and detailed further on Slide 26 in the appendix, the new operating category named Other is forecasted to have a net operating loss of approximately neutral to $25 million. This range includes first quarter net operating loss of approximately $65 million on a continuing operations basis. Beginning in April, transition service agreements costs plus a markup will be reimbursed to 3M, and therefore, we will generate modest income in the remaining 3 quarters of the year. \n Finally, Corporate and Unallocated includes full year 2024 sales in the range of $225 million to $275 million for commercial agreements with Solventum beginning in April. We expect full year Corporate and Unallocated net operating loss in the range of $125 million to $175 million. These ranges include first quarter revenue of approximately $25 million and net operating loss of approximately $75 million. \n As we have previously discussed, we estimate annualized dis-synergies of approximately $150 million to $175 million. These costs were previously associated with Solventum and will now be allocated to Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics and Consumer starting in April. \n Specific to Q2, we expect continued strong execution to drive operating performance. As disclosed in our Form 10-K, stock-based compensation grants were delayed to Q2. As a result, we expect to incur $125 million to $150 million in expense in Q2. We will also increase investments to support end-market demand and drive growth and productivity. \n Please turn to Slide 16 for more details by business group. Taking into account my earlier comments regarding current full year macroeconomic and major end-market forecasts, we estimate organic sales growth in Safety and Industrial to be flat to up low single digits. Adjusted organic sales growth for Transportation and Electronics is forecasted to be up low single digits. This is better than our estimated range of flat to up low single digits provided in January, recognizing our strong Q1 growth performance. \n And in Consumer, we estimate organic sales to be down low single digits, which includes our ongoing product portfolio initiatives. These actions are estimated to create a year-on-year organic growth headwind for the Consumer business of approximately 2 percentage points. \n I want to take a moment to thank our team for the work they have done in successfully executing across our 3 strategic priorities. Their disciplined work has created value and returned capital to shareholders with the successful spinout of our Health Care business. They have also helped reduce risk by reaching 2 large settlements while making progress on the exit of PFAS manufacturing. And most importantly, our teams have made tremendous progress on fundamentally improving how we work, which is driving better performance across the business. \n In closing, we delivered a strong start to the year. As we look ahead, we are focused on building on our momentum, supporting expectations for a return to organic top line growth, margin expansion, investments in high-growth and attractive end markets and continued strong cash generation. This leaves us well positioned for long-term success and consistent value creation for our customers and shareholders. \n Please turn to Slide 17, and I will turn it back over to Mike. Mike? \nMichael Roman: Thanks, Monish. \n Paying a competitive dividend has been a priority for 3M for more than 100 years. This will continue to be true following the spin-off of Solventum. As part of the spin, we distributed 80.1% of Solventum's outstanding shares to our shareholders and post-spin have made the decision to reset 3M's dividend. \n As a result, we anticipate a dividend of approximately 40% of adjusted free cash flow. This represents a dividend that is in line with our industrial peers and well above the S&P 500 median with the potential to increase over time. \n We expect to seek Board approval to declare the second quarter dividend in May with payments anticipated in June. In addition, post spin, we have stepped back into the market for share repurchases. \n Before I conclude, let me emphasize some important points from the quarter. Q1 was a strong start to the year, driven by significant improvements in operational execution as well as the achievement of several major milestones toward our strategic goals, including the successful spin-off of Solventum and the settlement of 2 major legal matters. \n I would like to thank our people for their dedication and continued focus on delivering value for our customers and shareholders. Through their efforts, we are well positioned to deliver a strong 2024. \n Tomorrow, May 1, I transition into the role of Executive Chairman. I look forward to working with Bill Brown as he assumes the role of CEO. \n That concludes our formal remarks, and we will now take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We go first this morning to Julian Mitchell of Barclays. \nJulian Mitchell: Congratulations, Mike, on the transition. And obviously, you'll stay very involved in the Executive Chairman role. \nMichael Roman: Yes. Thank you, Julian. \nJulian Mitchell: Absolutely. Maybe just to start off with, Monish, you packed a lot of clarification on the moving parts into the prepared remarks. Maybe just to try and understand a little bit better the quarterly sort of cadence here. So it sounds like second quarter EPS, down slightly maybe versus the sort of [ 170 ] comp ops number for Q1, and that's really because of the stock comp and the one-timers that you talked about. \n So do we think about sort of second quarter revenue being similar to first quarter margins down a bit because of the stock comp and one-timers? And then as we step into the second half, you've got higher revenues half-on-half and then sort of good operating leverage of the stepped-up revenue. Maybe just any thoughts around that. \nMonish Patolawala: Yes. I would say, Julian, so you summarized it. I would go back and say there's so many moving pieces that I would really say first look at first half, second half. And then when you do that, we would also show you that on revenue, we are starting to hit normal seasonality trends. \n So on revenue, the first half, second half is 49-51. And then the margin split first half, second half is 47-53. And the reason for that is some of the items that you've mentioned. Part of the biggest item there is the -- is Solventum's first quarter, where we don't get reimbursed for TSAs, and that's driving the 47 to 53. \n If you now go into the important factors just into Q2 to make sure that I cover all the points, restructuring charges are between $250 million to $300 million for the year. 70% is weighted to the first half. Similarly, you mentioned it too and I said that in my prepared remarks, we will incur stock-based compensation headwind around $120 million to $150 million. \n FX, the stronger dollar continues to remain in the second quarter. So we got to factor all that in. And I would say that's why we've given you first half, second half guidance, there are more details. I know Bruce and the team can walk you through it. But if you start with that, I think you'll get directionally in the zone that we are talking about. \nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful. And then maybe a second question, perhaps more for Mike, but on capital allocation. So clearly, you and the Board spent a lot of time thinking about balance sheet leverage of 3M to settle on that sort of 40% dividend payout ratio. You also mentioned, though, on the buyback some step-up since the Solventum spin. So maybe help us understand kind of how you and the Board are thinking about 3M's leverage requirements from here. How meaningful could a buyback be? And then tied to that, Monish, any clarification on interest expense guide for this year based on that balance sheet? \nMichael Roman: Sure, Julian. I would start with we continue to be a strong cash generator, and we're well capitalized to invest in our business, which is -- continues to be the first priority for capital allocation and also return capital to shareholders, including the dividend that we've been talking about and share repurchases. \n And I -- my comment, we're back in the market. The pace will depend on how we view the macro, how we look at our performance, the intrinsic value of our stock. We haven't declared really how we're going to move forward on that. But I -- so well positioned to, like I said, invest and drive the capital allocation priorities that we talk about. \nMonish Patolawala: Julian, I'll answer your second question. When we talk about below-the-line items, we talk about 2 things: mainly it's pension and it's interest expense/income. So I'll combine the 2. So our guide is net expense of $75 million to $100 million or $0.10 to $0.15 per share. Q2, as I mentioned, will continue to benefit from the interest income that we receive from the -- dividend that we receive from Solventum of $7.7 billion. And so therefore, the $75 million to the $100 million guide for the year will mostly be weighted to the second half of the year. \nOperator: We go next now to Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. \nNigel Coe: Mike, hopefully, the Exec Chairman role is a bit less stressful than Chairman and CEO role. So congratulations on that. So just a few more -- maybe a few more details on the 2Q, Monish. The restructuring -- and I understand 70% in the first half, 30% in the second half. How does that phase between 1Q and 2Q? I'm just trying to understand whether that's fairly level-loaded or whether there's a bit more coming through in the second quarter.\n And then on the restructuring, I see the total charges. But in terms of the gross payback, what kind of payback are we assuming on that restructuring? And are we still on a 3M RemainCo basis, still on track for $700 million to $900 million of savings by '25? \nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So I'll start with the first one, Nigel. As I said, it's 70% weighted in the first half of the $250 million to $300 million range. In the first quarter, at a holdco basis, we did $122 million of restructuring that I've said in my announcement, and then you'll see Health Care was approximately $20 million of that. So you've got $100 million that is on a RemainCo basis. And so the balance is -- so you can get the math.\n When I come to your next piece on payback, I just wanted to start again, I've said this before, I'll say it again, you have to look at restructuring in total. So when we started this program we said, there are multiple things we wanted to achieve. Number one was we wanted to change the way we work, and the way we achieved that was streamlining our supply chain, getting a shorter path to customers and third was reduce stranded cost, have a lighter center as well as create oxygen to invest in the business. And when we put that program together, that was including holdco.\n As we have now spun out Health Care, you can see all those items starting to come in, which is margin expansions coming in. And that is happening because of the improvement we have in our supply chain and the way we work. It's happening because we are closer to customers. It's happening because we have reduced stranded cost.\n When we started our journey and we announced the spin of Health Care, we had said industry benchmark was somewhere between 1% to 1.5% of sales, which is like $400 million to $450 million. And now our dis-synergies from the spinout of Health Care are the $150 million to $175 million, and we're going to keep working that, in some cases, grow into it; in some cases, we'll keep working it down. And you've seen we've been able to do that.\n And at the same time, we've created oxygen to invest in the business. And Mike mentioned some of the spec-in wins that we have got in TEBG. We have continued to invest in CBG. In a downmarket, we have done the same with SIBG, and we had over 30 new launches across the company in the first quarter. So that's the way I would look at it.\n On a payback basis, I would tell you that we are still continuing to have very good payback. And in fact, we were able to accelerate some of our restructuring actions as well as get some onetime gains like property sales in Q1. So overall, look at the total margin, 200 to 275 basis points up on a year-over-year basis, which is a reflection of all the actions the team has taken. \nNigel Coe: Great. My follow-up question is on the dividend. There's been a huge sort of [ core ] industry about the potential dividend scenarios, but hopefully, that's now behind us. But the 40% payout ratio on adjusted free cash flow, is the intent, Mike, to keep that 40% relatively stable going forward, so as you grow earnings and free cash flow going forward, the dividend should increase as well? \nMichael Roman: Yes, I would think of it as a guide of how we're thinking about it. The approximately 40% of adjusted free cash flow, that's the way the Board -- that's the guide that the Board is looking at as we go forward. So I -- that's where we start as we go forward with continuing operations. That's the best way to think about it, Nigel. \nOperator: We go next now to Andy Kaplowitz at Citi. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Mike, thanks for all your help over the years. Congratulations. \nMichael Roman: Thanks. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Can you update us on your industrial channels within Safety and Industrial? Are they generally to the point where you have better visibility and destocking is mostly over? And it does seem like -- for instance, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes has been turning the corner over the last couple of quarters. Is that a bit of a canary in the short-cycle industrial businesses that you have? \nMichael Roman: Yes. Andy, I would say if you look at inventory in the channels as kind of a measure of that, that's -- I would say it's been reducing some of the inventory in the channel really around improving supply chains. We talked a bit about this last quarter. As supply chains improve, our distributors in the channel are taking advantage of shorter-cycle times and managing down some of their inventory. \n There's also a bit of a cautious outlook. Monish talked about a mixed outlook for industrial markets. And if you think about it, look at our results from Q1, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes and Personal Safety, when you adjust for the year-over-year respiratory change, those were both -- they are multiple market -- multiple industrial market-focused, and they are both up slightly in the quarter. So they're seeing a bit of both across their markets. \n We have some market-focused businesses like Industrial Mineral as that's seeing strong demand. And then we have some other market-focused businesses in industrial like automotive aftermarket and our kind of our industrial specialties, which was a lot of our products that go into shipping. So the shipping dynamics, the mild winter impacts on auto repairs, those are -- we're seeing kind of the downside of that in some of those markets. \n So it's a mixed market. Again, the channel is adjusting, taking advantage of improving supply chains and, I would say, somewhat cautious about the broader mixed nature of those end markets. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: That's helpful, Mike. And then, Monish, obviously, you mentioned the relatively good T&E start. You did have a pretty easy comparison in Q1. But 7% growth, you're still guiding of low single digits. I know it's up a little bit. You mentioned the buy ahead was a big part of the Q1 improvement. But is there any reason why your improved spec-ins wouldn't continue in electronics? And then are you seeing any improvement at all yet in semiconductors and those kind of end markets? \nMonish Patolawala: Yes. I would say, first, we are thrilled that we've got the spec-ins, so that's a big positive. As I said, 2/3 of the total, 6.7%, that's approximate. We don't have the perfect number. We believe it's partly driven by inventory normalization both in auto and electronics, plus customers starting to buy ahead as they start building for end markets or consumer end markets.\n What I would tell you is second half is so important for the consumer electronics business, and we are watching that trend. If there is a big pickup in consumer electronics, we will definitely grow with it because we are now specced in to many more devices than before. So that -- I would say second half is what we are watching, but this is where we see it right now.\n And then on semiconductor, our view is we saw the first quarter slow, and we believe that this will pick up in the second half, Andy. And that's what we are watching there, too. All indications keep saying that it's going to get better, but we are watching those trends. \nOperator: We'll go next now to Scott Davis of Melius Research. \nScott Davis: Best of luck to you, Mike, in your next endeavors, et cetera. \nMichael Roman: Thanks, Scott. \nScott Davis: Guys, I had a couple. I'll just start with a [ knit ] and then ask a real question. But why -- I'm looking at Slide 27. Why does the 2026 payment dip? What was kind of the -- just walk us through a little bit of the color of the kind of how these payments were negotiated annually. \nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So there were so many facts that were put together, Scott. This is one of them on how these profiles were scheduled. So there's no particular reason to give it out to you. This was a lot of factors, pluses and minuses that put the whole agreement together. \nScott Davis: Okay. So there's nothing specific in there that 2026, you'd... \nMonish Patolawala: No. \nScott Davis: I can take it off-line. \nMonish Patolawala: Yes. \nScott Davis: Okay. More importantly, Mike, if you look back at the long-term growth rate ex Health Care of 3M, it's been kind of sub-2%, so below GDP. And that includes some price inevitably, I would assume. What do you think the entitlement growth rate of this business is longer term? I mean just go back 10 years, so I think that's a full cycle for sure. But when you think about the next 3 or 5 years, what do you think that the business should be able to grow at? Obviously, Bill is going to have his own initiatives. But what is your view on that? \nMichael Roman: Yes. Scott, I won't get ahead of Bill and kind of how he's going to think about going forward. You saw our guidance for this year, it's in line with macro. Importantly, when you look at what drives our growth, it's really investing in the business. The organic investments have been the dominant driver of growth for us as a company, and we expect that to continue as we move forward.\n Like I said in my speech, making indispensable products for our customers, and that means leveraging our innovation, our technologies, our manufacturing capabilities to come up with differentiated solutions for our customers and do that more and more prioritizing our investments. As we've talked a lot about, where do we prioritize investments? In attractive markets, markets that are -- have growth dynamics that are better than the macro. That's kind of the way to really drive this growth strategy forward, and that's how we think about it. That's how we focus.\n It's important that we really do prioritize leveraging our innovation so that we create not only the growth, but the differentiated value leader in a way we deliver value to shareholders in terms of margins and cash. And so it's a -- that's the way I think about the formula for growth, and it's been the foundation for building the company, and it's a foundation for success as we go forward as well. \nScott Davis: Totally fair. I'll pass it on, but congrats on getting all this work done the last year. It's -- I'm sure it's been a lot of heavy-lifting. So congrats and best of luck this year. \nMichael Roman: Thanks, Scott. \nMonish Patolawala: Thank you. \nOperator: We'll go next now to Andrew Obin of Bank of America. \nAndrew Obin: It's Andrew Obin. Mike, congratulations, and great job getting all this legal stuff out of the way. \nMichael Roman: Thanks, Andrew. \nAndrew Obin: Yes. So I would take an issue with Scott's statement about lack of growth at 3M. I don't know where he's getting his numbers because pre-COVID, company has grown at, on average, at 3.7% organically based on my model. So I actually have the exact opposite question. What is this, for example, safety and growth, right? You say that industrial production is growing 2%, yet the guidance is 0% to 2%. You have 100 bps sort of this portfolio geography drag.\n Can we just dig in as to what you think are impediments to growth coming out post COVID? Because it does seem thing has changed after that. Can we just -- right? Because I would have expected that you would outperform industrial production, right? And every year, there seem to be sort of new headwinds that are completely logical, but they seemingly come out of nowhere. Why the company's growth sort of seems to be below average? \nMichael Roman: Yes. Andrew, it's kind of building on maybe my answer to Scott. The macro is an important part of this, and we think about the macro for us -- for 3M is a combination of GDP where we have our Consumer business, and then it's also around industrial production in a broader industrial and transportation and electronics. But importantly, we go down and we really look at the markets that we're part of. \n And so driving that growth and, again, the way we deliver on growth better than macro or in line with macro is to pick markets where we can really leverage our innovation and be differentiated and drive our growth out of those attractive markets. And so what is the driver of it? Maybe if you don't do this well, that's your impediment question is to really prioritize those attractive markets where you can -- where we can deliver differentiated 3M solutions. That's the model that will drive us forward. \nAndrew Obin: Right. And then maybe just a follow-up. I know you guys are tweaking your global distribution, exiting some, right, direct distribution. You are starting to utilize distributors. Can you just talk about sort of what have you experienced so far with these changes to the models? What are the pros and cons? Because some of the commentary referred is that 3M is leaving money on the table with its distributor, some sort of legal risk associated. How do you mitigate those? And what has the experience been so far? \nMichael Roman: Yes. Andrew, just talking about the change, so this was part of the restructuring -- actually was part of the model change that we've been making, really focusing on leading through our businesses globally and prioritizing where they -- the most important parts of their business and looking at what's the best model to put in place. And so geographic prioritization was the way we termed it.\n And so we focused on some of those smaller countries that we operate in. We talked about approximately 30. We've launched this in 27 countries at this point. It's really a model to move to an export model. And we do have to -- it's much more than kind of the way we've talked about on the headlines. You have to set up a successful model. You have to set up a model to support distributors. You're changing from the traditional 3M model in those countries to an export-driven model. So it's important that we not only have capabilities in region, but globally to support that kind of model in those countries.\n It's also important that we have a strong governance everywhere we operate around the world. So we continue to focus on advancing our governance model as we make those changes. So it is much more dimensions to the change. We're off to a good start and successful with that. We call it a revenue impact this year because we're switching to an export model. And so we're driving a different price model with our distributors. But that is going to continue to drive, I think as it succeeds, will drive very good performance for us on a go-forward basis. \nMonish Patolawala: It also helps us -- to add on to Mike's comments on pros, benefits, you take a lot of structure out from those countries, that also has benefited us on the margin line. It also helps us focus our portfolio. Like what are we going to sell? And therefore, it's SKU rationalization that once you get through this, you will have a different inventory profile that support those smaller countries. So they're still very important countries for us. In no way are we walking away. It's just a different way of approaching them. \nOperator: We'll go next now to Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. \nJoseph Ritchie: Mike, I echo all the best of luck, congratulations. \nMichael Roman: Thanks, Joe. \nJoseph Ritchie: I'm going to start just -- just let us start with a quick just clarification. So just apologies if I missed it, like Slide 15, where you give the operating income number of $1.2 billion. So if I just kind of back out the performance this quarter, it assumes Health Care stranded cost of roughly $100 million to $150 million goes to the segment. So I just want to make sure I have that right.\n And then also on that slide, on the restructuring charges, Monish, going back to your comments from earlier, so the way to think about it is $100 million-ish the first quarter ex the Health Care number, that's the apples-to-apples comparison to the restructuring charges of $250 million to $300 million for the year? \nMonish Patolawala: So try me again on the first piece of the question because I didn't follow exactly. But I'll answer your second one. So the $250 million to the $300 million is embedded in here, and that's on a continuing ops basis. So that does not include Health Care. \nJoseph Ritchie: Okay. All right. Great. Yes. So just on the operating income quickly, I think you guys have roughly $1.7 billion this quarter. I think we had like roughly, call it, $350 million or so in Health Care profit. So you back that out, that's above the $1.2 billion number. So I was just basically trying to understand how much the Health Care stranded costs go into the other segments. \nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So I think that there are 2 pieces to this. One is the dis-synergies of Health Care, which on an annualized basis right now, we think it's $150 million to $175 million. And then the second piece of this is, as I've mentioned, there's $250 million of cost that we hold on behalf of Solventum for which you get reimbursed in April 1 onwards. So you eat Q1 with no reimbursement basically. \n So if you look at our Other segment, Joe, you will see -- or Other category, you will see a loss of $65 million in there in Q1. And that's basically, we don't get reimbursed for that in Q1. \nJoseph Ritchie: Got it. Okay. No, I think I've got it and can follow up afterwards... \nMonish Patolawala: Yes, Bruce can follow up off-line with you. \nJoseph Ritchie: Yes, yes. And then just another quick follow-up on the electronics business. And so I know the stats you kind of gave on demand and then inventory normalization. Is it possible to kind of parse out the inventory benefit that you're seeing? I'm just curious like how much of that 15% came from just inventories normalizing just because -- maybe I'm just not close to it anymore. But I'm just curious, like what other like products are really kind of driving end-market demand for electronics at this point? \nMichael Roman: Yes. Joe, what we talked about in the results for TEBG in the first quarter in electronics, these are spec-in wins on some of the mobile platforms. And so the inventory, it's getting ready for the demand, really the demand that they're seeing into the second quarter. And at this point, it's really -- that's the step-up. And then there's a portion of it that's inventory kind of filling into the value chain of those OEMs. But it's -- the bigger part of it is the spec-in -- for us, anyway, the bigger part of it is the wins in the spec-in side of it. \nJoseph Ritchie: And Mike, that's smartphone demand? \nMichael Roman: It's mobile devices, largely phones. Yes, yes, largely phones. \nOperator: We'll go next now to Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Mike, congrats again, and thanks for all the help over the years and the effort. \nMichael Roman: Yes. Thanks, Steve. Thanks. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Just to be clear, you said 40% of adjusted free cash flow. Can you just help us with what the construct of that is? What is adjusted free cash flow? \nBruce Jermeland: You're referring to the dividend, Steve, I presume? \nC. Stephen Tusa: Yes, just the construct. I don't need a number for cash. Just how do you define that adjusted free cash? \nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So if you look at all our material that we have submitted, you will see historically what we have broken out is from our GAAP results, there are certain items that we have been adjusting to get to adjusted results, which is litigation expenses. Number one. Number two is PFAS because we've been exiting -- we've been showing PFAS as an exit. And number three was all the costs incurred to spin out Solventum or the Health Care business. \n So it's the same construct there. And as always, Steve, if we decide to change something, we'll keep you all posted on changes to adjustments. So those are the big ones. And if you see our press release statements or schedules, you will see that split by category in there. \nBruce Jermeland: Yes. Steve, it's all detailed in our press release attachments. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Right. So whatever you're paying out in cash for these liabilities, that is adjusted out of free cash. So for example, the $4.3 billion or whatever in this year will be adjusted out, and then you take whatever we want to assume for free cash flow and then take 40% of that? \nMonish Patolawala: Correct. \nBruce Jermeland: Correct. \nOperator: We'll go next now to Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. \nJeffrey Sprague: Thanks for clarifying that on the dividend. That was a key question. Also, I just wonder, to any degree, has Bill Brown been involved in the kind of the formulation of the updated guidance here, whether explicitly or tacitly? And I know he's formally starting tomorrow, but just any color on that would be interesting and helpful. \nMichael Roman: Sure, Jeff. Bill is, as you would expect, getting ready to step into the role. He's been engaged with myself and senior management and the Board since the announcement. But he's really -- his part is being informed and getting ready to start, as you said, tomorrow. He's not part of the decisions on what we've laid out here in the earnings call today. So he starts tomorrow. Bill starts tomorrow, and I look forward to working with him as he does. \nJeffrey Sprague: Great. And then just thinking about, again, the cash flows as it relates to the liability outflow that we're looking at here. What guidance, if any, could you provide on what you're thinking on insurance recoveries? And if you're successful in those claims, when those might start flowing as potential offsets to the liability schedule? \nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So we believe that we are eligible for insurance payments. We have put our insurance providers on notice for PWS and for Combat Arms. And in fact, for Combat Arms, we have -- we are working on an arbitration to recover that. So as you know, these things take some time to work through, and that's what the teams are working on. And we'll keep you posted as soon as we come to know on what that number could look like. \nOperator: We go next now to Brett Linzey of Mizuho. \nBrett Linzey: Congrats to Mike. \nMichael Roman: Thanks, Brett. \nBrett Linzey: Yes. I want to come back to the portfolio and the geographic prioritization. So you called out the 100 basis points headwind in '24. Should we think of the first quarter as the starting point and just simply anniversary that headwind for the balance of the year and it's complete? Or is this more of a multiyear initiative with some top line drag? \nMonish Patolawala: So there's a little bit of drag next year, but I -- it's not big. I would just say the first half of this year will be slightly heavier than the second. But directionally, I would say, yes, you can use the first quarter as the math that gets you across the 4 quarters. \nBrett Linzey: Okay. Great. I guess the follow-up, you called out some contribution from those initiatives in each of the segments. Are you able to size what that benefit is? And I would imagine it's sort of structural, but any color would be great. \nMonish Patolawala: Yes. I would just say when we look at it in total is why are we doing these portfolio moves or geographic moves. It comes down to it allows us to do better focus, better prioritization. So at the end of the day, you're going to see it in multiple places. You're going to see better sales growth in other products because we're exiting these and the teams can focus, whether it's ad, merch, et cetera.\n You will see it in inventory because, again, we'll be able to focus our inventory on the products that we want to focus on. And you're going to see it a little bit in margin. That margin will take a little bit of time to come through. But some of these products that we are exiting are below our average margin. So it does help us lift the average margin. And then as I said on the geographic prioritization side, you get a lot of structure out, which is already embedded in our margin that we are seeing. And we are getting some onetime benefits on property sales that we disclosed this quarter. \nOperator: We'll go next now to Joe O'Dea of Wells Fargo. \nJoseph O'Dea: I wanted to ask on PFAS, and you've talked about the exits there, kind of progressing to plan, if not a little bit ahead of plan. But just how do we think about alternatives? I think there's been press over the years on different applications across a number of different end markets when we think about semiconductors or military or auto. Do you expect to participate in that? I mean, where are you on the sort of product innovation pipeline and being able to sort of provide alternative products to what you're exiting? \nMichael Roman: Yes. And Joe, as I said in my comments, we work with each of our customers as part of the transition. I would say there's kind of 3 alternatives for them. One is PFAS from another source. A number of the applications, many of the significant applications, they're challenged to find an alternative. So that's what they're looking to do is source PFAS from another supplier.\n The second one is perhaps there's a chemistry that has similar properties that isn't PFAS, and you can move into that. We're exiting PFAS, and we're not going to move into other chemistries. They'll be durable and persistent to meet the requirements of these applications.\n The one area where we can help and what we're doing for ourselves is working to discontinue the use of PFAS in our products. And we're engineering them all. We're designing them. We're on them. And there's a number of applications our customers have where that's very difficult to do and challenging, and they don't know a solution today. But for us, the majority -- the vast majority, we're already worked through solutions. So that's something that we can help customers with, and we are. We're helping them look at the alternative ways to design and engineer their processes and products. \nJoseph O'Dea: That's helpful. And then second question is just related to CERCLA designation and really just trying to understand what the designation versus not getting the designation means at a high level. I think when you first announced this being proposed, you talked about how 3M's view was this would not lead to a timely or appropriate kind of remediation. But just to try to understand, having the designation versus not having it at the end of the day, kind of what that means. \nMichael Roman: Yes. There are certain, I would say, EPA responsibilities that would come with CERCLA designation. We, at this point, we don't anticipate an impact on our ability to serve customers. And we'll -- as we better understand all of those requirements, and we're committed to meeting and complying with the requirements under CERCLA and the EPA guidelines. \nOperator: And we'll go next now to Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. \nDeane Dray: My congrats to Mike and also to the team on orchestrating all these moving parts. \nMichael Roman: Yes. Thanks, Deane. \nMonish Patolawala: Thank you, Deane. \nDeane Dray: And just a quick follow-up on that last PFAS question. So the enforcement actions by the EPA, they set PFAS as hazardous. So that's a milestone and then in the process of setting up the Superfund. So would either of these actions put you closer to be able to set a reserves? I know you couldn't before for accounting purposes. It was not estimable or the probable, but now we're closer to that. So are you closer to where you could be setting reserves for these remaining unaddressed PFAS liabilities? \nMichael Roman: Yes. Deane, we are -- as I've said a number of times, we're proactively managing this, all aspects of the PFAS dynamic. And as soon as we can get to probable and estimable, we will take the reserves. And we'll keep you informed, and I would refer to our SEC filings for updates. \nDeane Dray: That's really helpful. And just one other one, I'm sorry. Is there any scenario where 3M would continue to manufacture PFAS after the year-end 2025 target? \nMichael Roman: No, Deane, we're committed to that exit. We're on track, and we're committed to follow through. \nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments. \nMichael Roman: This concludes my last earnings call as 3M's CEO. I would like to thank the investors, shareholders, analysts, employees and family who join these calls each quarter. I greatly appreciate your questions and diligence in working to better understand our company. I'm confident that under Bill's leadership, our people will continue to build on the momentum from our strong start to the year.\n Thank you for joining us, and have a great day. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line at this time."}]}
