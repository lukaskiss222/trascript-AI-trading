Cisco's Q3 2006 earnings call painted a picture of strong performance, exceeding expectations on orders and revenue growth.  Management highlighted continued strength in the U.S. and emerging markets, particularly in service providers. While acknowledging some cautious guidance from competitors, Cisco projected continued growth in the 10-15% range.  The acquisition of Scientific-Atlanta appeared to be integrating smoothly, with slightly lower gross margins offset by high customer satisfaction.  This suggests a likely positive short-term impact on the stock price driven by strong performance and positive outlook.
