Cisco's Q1 FY23 earnings call showed strong results exceeding guidance, driven by improved supply chains and higher-than-expected shipments.  Management raised full-year guidance, citing increased visibility and a backlog that's 2-3 times historical norms.  While macroeconomic headwinds are acknowledged, particularly in Europe, the company is positioned to capitalize on resilient demand in other regions and its software-driven revenue model.  This suggests a very positive short-term impact on the stock price.
