Cisco's Q2 2012 earnings call highlighted strong financial results exceeding guidance, driven by record revenue and earnings per share growth, along with accelerated expense reduction targets.  Management conveyed confidence in the company's long-term strategy, noting consistent gains in market share, a strong balance sheet, and increased customer value as they transition to business-technology architectures rather than purely IT budgets.  However, cautious guidance for Q3 suggests some macroeconomic uncertainty and potential for slower IT spending.
