Cisco's earnings call highlights strong Q4 results, with record revenue and EPS growth.  Management's tone is optimistic, emphasizing the success of their intent-based networking strategy and the acquisition of Duo Security, positioning the company well for the multi-cloud transition.  Guidance for Q1 fiscal 2019 suggests continued growth, but the operating margin outlook is relatively flat, likely due to higher component costs.
