Cisco's earnings call highlighted strong Q4 results, exceeding revenue expectations and showing continued stock buybacks. Management emphasized the company's strategic positioning in the network as a platform for applications and services, a shift that's driving market share gains and greater customer spend.  This positive outlook, combined with robust order growth and backlog, suggests a positive short-term impact on the stock price, as investors likely anticipate continued success in 2007.
