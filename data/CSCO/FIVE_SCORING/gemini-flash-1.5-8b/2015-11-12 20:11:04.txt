Cisco's Q1 earnings were strong, exceeding expectations on profitability, but guidance for Q2 fell short of market expectations due to macroeconomic uncertainty and currency impacts, particularly outside the US.  Management highlighted continued investment in key growth areas like cloud and data center,  and emphasized the significant progress on products like Nexus 3000 and WebEx. However, this short-term headwind from weak enterprise orders and currency fluctuations will likely present some downward pressure on the stock over the next few weeks.
