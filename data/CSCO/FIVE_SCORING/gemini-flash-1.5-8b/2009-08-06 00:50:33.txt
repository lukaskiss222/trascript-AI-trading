Cisco's Q4 earnings suggest a potential bottoming out of the negative sequential order trend.  Improved sequential order growth, particularly in Enterprise, Commercial, and Government segments, along with exceeding expense reduction goals, offer a glimmer of hope. While year-over-year declines persist, the positive sequential trend and management's focus on new market adjacencies, like Smart Grid and Small Business, suggest potential for a bottoming out of the current negative momentum.  The stock price is likely to show positive short-term impact through the next 1-2 weeks due to the signaling that the worst may be over.
