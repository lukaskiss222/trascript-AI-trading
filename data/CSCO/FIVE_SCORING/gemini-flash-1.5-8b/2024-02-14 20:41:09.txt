Cisco's earnings call indicates a cautious outlook for the near future.  While the company delivered better-than-expected Q2 results, management lowered guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year due to macro uncertainties, elevated inventory levels among customers, and weakness in the service provider market.  This suggests potential short-term pressure on the stock price, but the company's focus on software subscriptions and recurring revenue, coupled with the pending Splunk acquisition, suggest long-term growth opportunities.
