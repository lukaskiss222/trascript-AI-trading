Cisco's earnings call highlights strong Q4 performance exceeding guidance, driven by robust demand across all segments, particularly in the public sector and enterprise.  Management emphasizes the normalization of order patterns and increased customer investment in AI-related infrastructure, although initial AI order growth is predominantly in the web scale.  The company's emphasis on a platform approach and integrating Splunk is apparent, with signs indicating that the initial integration synergies are positive.  The stock is likely to see positive short term movement as a result.
