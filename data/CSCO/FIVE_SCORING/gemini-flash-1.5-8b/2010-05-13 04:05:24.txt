Cisco's Q3 earnings call highlighted record-breaking results across various segments.  Management expressed confidence in the company's strategy and execution, particularly in the strength of new product introductions (Nexus, ASR) and acquisitions (Tandberg).  These positive signals, combined with improved order growth globally, suggest a positive short-term outlook for the stock price.
