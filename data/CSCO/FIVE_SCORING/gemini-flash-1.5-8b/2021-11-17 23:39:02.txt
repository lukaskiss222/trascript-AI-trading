Cisco's Q1 earnings call highlights strong order growth (33%) despite ongoing supply chain constraints.  Management emphasizes a successful shift towards software and subscriptions, evident in robust ARR and RPO growth.  However, supply chain issues are impacting revenue realization, leading to concerns about the immediate impact on gross margins.  The strong backlog suggests the company is well-positioned for future growth, but the short-term impact on stock price will likely be muted by concerns regarding the timing and extent of revenue realization, potentially leading to muted or slightly negative sentiment in the short term.
