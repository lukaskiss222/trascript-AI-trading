Cisco's earnings call highlighted a global economic slowdown impacting revenue, particularly in service provider spending and enterprise IT budgets.  Management emphasized their focus on expense reduction, strategic investments in emerging technologies (like collaboration tools), and aggressive moves into market adjacencies.  While guidance for Q3 indicates a significant revenue decrease, the company's strong financial position and focus on innovation suggest a potential for a relatively quick recovery once the global economy improves.
