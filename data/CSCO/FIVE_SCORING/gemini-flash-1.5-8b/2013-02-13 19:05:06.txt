Cisco's Q2 FY13 earnings call showed continued solid financial performance, with record revenue and earnings per share growth.  Management expressed cautious optimism about a global economic recovery, highlighting improvements in the US enterprise and commercial sectors, but acknowledged ongoing challenges in Europe and China.  The company's strategic acquisitions and focus on integrated architectures in key market transitions (datacenter, cloud, mobility, video) position Cisco well for future growth.  This suggests a positive short-term outlook for the stock, driven primarily by the company's strong financial performance.
