Cisco's Q1 earnings call highlighted solid security performance, but tempered overall growth due primarily to weakness in service provider orders, impacting overall product orders.  Management attributed the dip to macro uncertainties and political/regulatory factors affecting service provider spending.  While focusing on software and subscription growth, the near-term outlook suggests continued pressure on traditional hardware revenue, with the implication that the stock price could face short-term negative impact, reflecting their cautious guidance on revenue decline.
