Cisco's earnings call highlighted record revenue and strong growth across most segments, particularly in emerging markets and service providers.  Management expressed confidence in the company's long-term prospects, fueled by the ongoing adoption of Web 2.0 technologies and continued expansion into new market segments.  The anticipated increase in network load from video applications, especially Telepresence, provides a strong short-term and likely sustained growth driver.  Given the optimism and record financial performance, a positive stock impact is likely over the next few weeks.
