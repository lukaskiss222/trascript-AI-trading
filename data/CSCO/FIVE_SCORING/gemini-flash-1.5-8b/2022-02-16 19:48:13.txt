Cisco's Q2 earnings show strong demand exceeding supply, leading to record backlog and double-digit growth across many product segments, particularly in enterprise and web scale.  Management expresses confidence in the company's ability to fulfill orders as supply constraints ease, but acknowledges these constraints will likely persist and impact the rate of revenue recognition.  The short-term outlook suggests maintaining strong stock price momentum, but tempered growth expectations due to ongoing supply chain issues.
