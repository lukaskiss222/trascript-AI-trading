Cisco's Q2 earnings call painted a picture of strong, balanced growth across most segments and geographies.  Management expressed optimism about the sustained economic recovery, and reported significant year-over-year and sequential improvements.  Guidance for Q3 suggests continued robust growth, but with a focus on cautious optimism given the still-evolving economic environment. Stock price is likely to rally on the earnings and guidance.
