Cisco's Q1 2015 earnings call highlighted continued strength in some areas, particularly the Americas excluding service providers, and some challenges in EMEA's emerging markets and the U.S. service provider sector.  Management attributed the latter to reduced spending from a few key players and noted that the pipeline remains strong, suggesting a potential rebound.  While product orders were flat year-over-year, management expressed optimism about the company's long-term strategy and position, suggesting continued positive short-term implications, but likely a muted performance for 2â€“4 weeks.
