Cisco's Q4 FY13 earnings call highlighted strong financial results exceeding guidance, driven by strong performance in switching, wireless, and data center segments.  However, a slowdown in APAC and some service provider weakness are noted, alongside a cautious outlook for Q1 FY14, and a workforce reduction of 4000.  Management signaled a focus on long-term growth by rebalancing resources toward high-growth areas.  The stock may see a short-term dip in response to the somewhat conservative Q1 guidance impacting short-term investor sentiment.
