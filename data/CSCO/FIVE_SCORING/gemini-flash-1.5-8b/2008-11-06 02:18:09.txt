Cisco's earnings call highlights a challenging Q1 with global order slowdown, particularly in the US and Western Europe.  Management, while acknowledging the difficult environment, remains optimistic about long-term growth potential (12-17%) and is aggressively implementing cost-cutting measures to mitigate short-term pressures.  The guidance for Q2 revenue decline (5-10%) suggests a continuation of the current slowdown and uncertainty in the market.
