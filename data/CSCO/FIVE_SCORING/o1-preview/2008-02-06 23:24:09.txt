Cisco reported solid Q2 earnings but issued lower-than-expected guidance for Q3, forecasting only 10% revenue growth due to weaker January orders and increased economic uncertainty. Management's cautious tone and acknowledgment of a rapid slowdown suggest significant short-term challenges, likely leading to a negative investor reaction. The stock price is expected to decline in the short term.
