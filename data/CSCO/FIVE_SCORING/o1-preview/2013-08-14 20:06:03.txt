However, the company's cautious Q1 revenue guidance of 3-5%, below its long-term targets, and the announcement of a 5% workforce reduction indicate concerns about slowing growth and macroeconomic challenges. These factors are likely to create short-term negative sentiment among investors, potentially putting downward pressure on the stock price.
