Cisco's earnings call showed that while the company met its revenue targets and maintained strong cash flow, it issued cautious guidance with expectations of slower revenue growth of 9-10% year-over-year for the next quarter. The slowing growth in key segments like the US market and service providers, coupled with concerns over macroeconomic uncertainties, may lead to short-term negative investor sentiment. As a result, the stock price is likely to experience downward pressure in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
