Cisco reported solid Q4 and fiscal year 2008 results, achieving record revenues and notable growth in emerging markets. However, the company provided cautious guidance for the first half of fiscal 2009, projecting revenue growth below their long-term targets due to macroeconomic uncertainties and potential weaknesses in the service provider segment. Management's acknowledgment of short-term challenges and reduced growth expectations may lead to negative sentiment toward the stock in the near term.
