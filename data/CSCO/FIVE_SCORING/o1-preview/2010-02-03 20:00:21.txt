Cisco's Q2 results significantly exceeded expectations, with an 8% year-over-year revenue increase and a 25% rise in non-GAAP EPS. Management provided strong guidance for Q3, projecting 23%-26% revenue growth, and expressed confidence in sustained economic recovery and their strategic positioning. The positive performance across all segments and plans to hire 2,000-3,000 employees indicate strong momentum likely to boost the stock price in the short term.
