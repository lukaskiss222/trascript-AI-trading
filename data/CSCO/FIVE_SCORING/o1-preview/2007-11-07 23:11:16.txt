Cisco reported strong Q1 results, with 17% revenue growth and robust gains across multiple segments, particularly in routing and advanced technologies. Despite some softness in the U.S. enterprise market, especially in financial services and automotive sectors, the company's positive guidance for Q2 and reaffirmed long-term growth targets suggest continued momentum. The strong performance and optimistic outlook are likely to have a positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
