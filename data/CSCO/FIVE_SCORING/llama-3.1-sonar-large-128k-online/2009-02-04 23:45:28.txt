Cisco's Q2 FY2009 earnings call highlighted several key points that impact the short-term outlook for the company's stock:

1. **Revenue and Earnings**: Cisco reported a 7.5% year-over-year decrease in revenue and a 21.2% decrease in GAAP EPS, which is a significant decline but within the expected range given the global economic challenges[2][3].
   
2. **Guidance**: The company provided Q3 revenue guidance indicating a year-over-year decrease of 15-20%, reflecting continued economic uncertainty[3].

3. **Expense Management**: Cisco is aggressively managing expenses, having already reduced its annual run rate by over $1 billion and planning further reductions. This includes realigning resources to high-growth areas and maintaining a strong balance sheet[3].

4. **Cash Flow and Financial Position**: Despite the challenging environment, Cisco generated strong cash flows from operations ($3.2 billion) and maintains a robust cash and investment position ($29.5 billion), which provides flexibility and strength[2][3].

5. **Market and Competitive Environment**: The company faces pricing pressure and competitive challenges but believes its differentiated strategy, focus on market transitions, and strong customer relationships will help maintain market share and position it for growth as the economy recovers[3].

6. **Innovation and Growth Areas**: Cisco is investing in emerging technologies such as collaboration, Web 2.0, video, and data center virtualization, which are expected to drive long-term growth. The adoption of these technologies is seen as a positive indicator for future performance[3].

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock is likely to be negative due to the lowered guidance and the ongoing economic challenges. However, the company's strong financial position, cost-cutting measures, and focus on strategic growth areas suggest a resilient long-term outlook.
