The earnings transcript for Cisco Systems, Inc. for the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 reveals several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **Revenue and Guidance**: Cisco reported revenue growth of 2% year-over-year, which was below expectations. The guidance for Q2 FY14 is particularly bleak, with an anticipated revenue decline of 8% to 10% year-over-year, largely due to a significant shortfall in orders during the last two weeks of Q1 and ongoing challenges in emerging markets and the service provider segment[6,.

2. **Macro and Micro Challenges**: The company faced macroeconomic headwinds, including the U.S. government shutdown, debt ceiling negotiations, and emerging market weakness. These factors exacerbated slower decision-making among business leaders and impacted Cisco's order growth[6!.

3. **Product Transitions and Cycles**: Cisco is managing through product transitions in high-end switching and routing, which have led to slower adoption of new platforms. This transition, combined with a challenging spending environment, is expected to affect growth in the next couple of quarters[6!.

4. **Strong Financial Discipline**: Despite the challenges, Cisco maintained strong non-GAAP profitability, with non-GAAP EPS of $0.53 and solid gross margins. The company also returned $2.9 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends[6!.

Given these points, the short-term outlook for Cisco's stock appears cautious due to the weaker-than-expected revenue growth, challenging macro environment, and product transition issues.

**Conclusion:**
The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance, macroeconomic uncertainties, and product transition challenges.

**Rating:**
