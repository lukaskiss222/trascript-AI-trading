The transcript for Cisco Systems' Q3 FY2016 earnings call presents a mixed but generally positive outlook. Here are the key points that influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Strong Execution**: Despite a challenging macro environment, Cisco delivered strong Q3 results with revenue growth of 3% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 6%. This indicates robust operational execution and financial discipline.

2. **Growth Areas**: Significant growth was seen in key areas such as security (17% revenue growth), collaboration (10% revenue growth), and the next-generation data center portfolio. These areas are crucial for long-term growth and have shown substantial progress.

3. **Macro Uncertainty**: While the company executed well, the macro environment remains uncertain. This caution is reflected in the guidance for Q4, which does not assume any improvement in the macro conditions. However, Cisco is well-positioned to benefit from any rebound in the global economy.

4. **Financial Health**: Cisco reported strong gross margins (65.2% non-GAAP), operating margins (30%), and a significant increase in deferred revenue related to software and subscription services. These metrics indicate healthy financial performance and a successful transition to more recurring revenue streams.

5. **Acquisitions and Partnerships**: The company has been active in acquiring strategic assets and forming partnerships, such as with Ericsson and Inspur, which are expected to contribute to future growth.

Given these points:

- Strong execution and growth in key areas suggest a positive outlook.
- However, the ongoing macro uncertainty and flat to slight decline in some segments (e.g., switching and routing) might temper immediate optimism.
- The financial health and strategic investments indicate long-term strength.

### Conclusion

The stock is likely to experience a positive but not greatly positive impact in the short term due to the balanced mix of strong execution, growth in key areas, and caution due to the macro environment.
