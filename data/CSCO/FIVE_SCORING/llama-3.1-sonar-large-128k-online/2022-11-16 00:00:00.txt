2. **Improved Supply Chain and Backlog**: The easing of supply chain constraints and the significant backlog ($30.9 billion) provide increased visibility and predictability, boosting confidence in the company's full-year outlook[1][3].

3. **Growth in Key Segments**: Strong performance in Secure Agile Networks, Security, and Optimized Application Experiences, along with robust demand in web-scale business, indicates sustainable growth drivers[1][3].

4. **Increased Guidance**: Cisco raised its full-year revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance, reflecting the company's confidence in its current and future performance[1][3].

5. **Business Model Transformation**: The shift towards more software and subscription-based recurring revenue is progressing well, with software subscription revenue growing 11% and total annualized recurring revenue (ARR) exceeding $23 billion, up 7%[1][3].
