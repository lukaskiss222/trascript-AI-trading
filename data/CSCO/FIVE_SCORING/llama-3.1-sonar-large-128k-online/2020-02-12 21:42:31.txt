Based on the earnings transcript for Cisco Systems, Inc., here are the key points that influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Revenue and Earnings**: Cisco reported a 4% year-over-year decline in revenue, with product revenue down 6% and service revenue up 5%. Despite this, non-GAAP EPS increased by 5% year-over-year, which is a positive indicator[1].

2. **Guidance**: The company provided Q3 guidance indicating a revenue decline of 1.5% to 3.5% year-over-year, which is slightly better than the previous quarter but still reflects ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties[1].

3. **Macro Uncertainty**: Cisco is experiencing longer decision-making cycles among customers due to global macro uncertainties, including Brexit and trade issues. However, the CEO expressed confidence that spending will recover once these uncertainties dissipate[1].

4. **Business Transformation**: Cisco is making significant progress in its business model transformation, particularly in shifting towards more software and subscription-based revenues. This transformation is expected to drive long-term growth and margin improvements[1].

5. **Product Performance**: Strong performance in certain segments like Security (up 9%) and Applications (despite a decline, driven by strong growth in AppDynamics) suggests areas of resilience and growth potential[1].

6. **Customer and Market Trends**: The company is well-positioned for future growth trends such as 5G, Wi-Fi 6, and cloud adoption. The launch of new products like Cisco Silicon One and the Cisco 8000 series, along with partnerships with major web-scale companies, indicates strong market acceptance and future opportunities[1].

Given these points:

- The positive EPS growth and strong margins despite revenue declines indicate robust financial management.
- The ongoing business transformation and strategic investments in growth areas like security and cloud solutions are positives.
- However, the guidance for continued revenue decline in Q3 and the impact of macro uncertainties might temper short-term enthusiasm.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive short-term impact due to the balanced mix of positive earnings performance, ongoing business transformation, and cautious guidance.
