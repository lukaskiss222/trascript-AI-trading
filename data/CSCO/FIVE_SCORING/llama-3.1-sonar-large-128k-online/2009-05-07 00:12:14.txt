The Q3 fiscal year 2009 earnings call for Cisco Systems reveals several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

1. **Revenue and Guidance**: Cisco reported a 17% year-over-year decrease in revenue, and guidance for Q4 indicates a further decline of 17-20% year-over-year. This suggests continued challenges in the market, which could be a short-term negative indicator[5].

2. **Expense Management and Financial Health**: Despite the revenue decline, Cisco managed to reduce operating expenses significantly and maintained a strong financial position, including a substantial cash and investments balance. This demonstrates effective financial management and could be viewed positively by investors[5].

3. **Innovation and Market Transition**: The company highlighted significant innovation and execution in new market adjacencies, such as virtualization, video architecture, and smart communities. These initiatives could position Cisco well for long-term growth, but the immediate impact on stock price may be mixed as investors weigh current performance against future potential[5].

4. **Customer and Market Sentiment**: While customers are seeing some stabilization in their business, the overall growth rates remain disappointing. This mixed sentiment might keep the stock price from rallying immediately[5].

Given these points, the short-term impact on Cisco's stock price is likely to be neutral or slightly negative due to the tempered revenue guidance and ongoing economic challenges, despite the company's strong financial management and innovative strategies.
