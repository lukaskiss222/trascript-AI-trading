Cisco Systems' Q2 fiscal 2017 earnings call presented a mix of positive and neutral signals that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term. Here are the key points:

- **Strong Performance in Key Areas**: Cisco saw significant growth in security, collaboration, and next-generation data center businesses, which are positive indicators.
- **Recurring Revenue Growth**: The company reported a 51% growth in product deferred revenue related to recurring software and subscriptions, indicating a successful transition towards more recurring revenue.
- **Guidance and Macro Environment**: The Q3 guidance is cautious, with revenue expected to be down 2% to 0% year-over-year, and there are macro uncertainties, particularly in Europe.
- **Cost and Margin Pressures**: There were specific headwinds such as higher DRAM memory costs and the impact of a national program in China that ended, which affected product gross margins.
- **Strategic Acquisitions and Investments**: The planned acquisition of AppDynamics and continued investment in innovation and automation are positive long-term strategies but may not immediately impact short-term performance.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive impact in the short term. The strong performance in key areas and the growth in recurring revenue are positives, but the cautious guidance and cost pressures may temper immediate enthusiasm.
