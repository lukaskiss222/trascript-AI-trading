Cisco Systems' Q3 FY13 earnings call presented several positive indicators that suggest a strong short-term outlook for the stock. Here are the key points:

1. **Record Results and Consistent Execution**: Cisco delivered its ninth consecutive quarter of record revenue, along with record non-GAAP operating income and net income. This consistent performance despite a challenging macroeconomic environment is a strong indicator of the company's execution and resilience.

2. **Growth in Key Markets**: Significant growth was observed in cloud data center (77%), wireless (27%), and SP Wi-Fi (triple-digit growth), which are strategic and high-growth areas. The company also saw positive trends in emerging markets and a robust performance in the U.S. across various customer segments.

3. **Strong Financials and Guidance**: Cisco reported stable gross margins, strong operating margins, and a solid cash flow performance. The guidance for Q4 FY13, although conservative, suggests continued revenue growth and profitability.

4. **Innovation and Market Leadership**: The company is leading in key technological transitions such as SDN, data center solutions, and cloud technologies. The integration of recent acquisitions and the continued focus on innovation position Cisco well for long-term growth.

5. **Shareholder Returns**: The significant increase in dividend and continued share buybacks indicate a commitment to shareholder value, which is typically well-received by investors.

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience positive sentiment in the short term.
