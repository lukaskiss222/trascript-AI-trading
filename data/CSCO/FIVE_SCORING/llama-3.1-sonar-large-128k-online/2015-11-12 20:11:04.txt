Cisco's Q1 FY2016 earnings transcript indicates a mixed bag of results that are likely to have a short-term impact on the stock price. Here are the key points:

- **Strong Q1 Performance**: Cisco reported a strong Q1 with 4% revenue growth, record non-GAAP EPS of $0.59, and strong gross and operating margins. This suggests solid execution and profitability[5|.
- **Lower Q2 Guidance**: Despite the strong Q1, the company provided Q2 guidance that was below market expectations, with revenue expected to grow 0% to 2% year over year. This guidance is tempered by macroeconomic and currency impacts, particularly outside the U.S.[5|.
- **Macro and Currency Headwinds**: The company is facing challenges due to a strong U.S. dollar, which is affecting orders and revenue growth, especially in regions like Asia-Pacific and Latin America[5|.
- **Innovation and Strategic Moves**: Cisco is driving significant innovation, particularly in areas like data center switching, security, and cloud services. The company is also making strategic acquisitions and partnerships, which are expected to contribute positively in the future[5|.
- **Customer and Market Confidence**: Despite near-term challenges, Cisco's CEO expressed optimism about the company's future, highlighting strong customer relationships and a robust innovation pipeline[5!.

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the lower-than-expected Q2 guidance and the ongoing macroeconomic and currency challenges. However, the long-term outlook remains positive due to Cisco's strong innovation pipeline and strategic moves.
