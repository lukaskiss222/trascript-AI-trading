Cisco's Q2 FY'14 earnings call presented a mixed picture with several key takeaways that impact the short-term outlook for the stock:

1. **Revenue and Guidance**: Cisco reported an 8% year-over-year revenue decline, and guidance for Q3 indicates a further decline of 6% to 8%. This suggests ongoing challenges in the near term.
2. **Product Transitions**: The company is managing through significant product transitions, particularly in core routing and switching, which are expected to take several quarters to ramp up.
3. **Emerging Markets and SP Weakness**: Emerging markets and service provider segments continue to be weak, which is a short-term headwind.
4. **Positive Segments**: There were positive notes on data center growth, security revenue, and the performance of recent acquisitions like Meraki and Sourcefire.
5. **Share Buybacks and Dividends**: Cisco returned a record $4.9 billion to shareholders, which is a positive signal for shareholder value but does not immediately offset the revenue decline.
6. **Long-term Strategy**: The company's focus on the Internet of Everything, architectural sales, and recurring revenue models suggests strong long-term potential, but these benefits may not materialize immediately.

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock is likely to be negative due to the reduced guidance, ongoing product transitions, and continued weakness in key segments.
