Cisco Systems' Q1 FY2018 earnings call presented several positive and neutral factors that will likely influence the stock price in the short term. Here are the key points:

### Positive Factors
- **Strong Adoption of New Products**: The company saw significant adoption of its new intent-based networking solutions, with over 1,100 customers adopting the Catalyst 9000 switching platform in just a few months. This indicates strong momentum in core business innovation.
- **Growth in Software and Subscriptions**: Cisco reported a 32% of total revenue from recurring offers, a 3-point increase from the previous year, and a 37% growth in software subscription revenue. This shift towards recurring revenue models is a positive indicator of long-term stability and growth.
- **Security Segment Performance**: The Security segment saw an 8% revenue growth, with strong performance in advanced threat, unified threat, and web security, and a 42% growth in deferred revenue.
- **Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships**: The acquisition of BroadSoft and the partnership with Google to develop a hybrid cloud solution are strategic moves that position Cisco well for future growth in multi-cloud environments.

### Neutral Factors
- **Revenue Growth Guidance**: The company guided for a revenue growth of 1% to 3% in Q2, which is cautiously positive but not exceptionally strong.
- **Gross Margin Pressure**: The impact of higher memory prices continues to affect gross margins, although this is expected to be temporary.
- **Enterprise Routing Weakness**: The decline in enterprise routing revenue, partly due to the SD-WAN transition, is a short-term challenge.

### Conclusion
Given the strong adoption of new products, growth in software and subscription revenues, and positive performance in the Security segment, these factors are likely to outweigh the short-term challenges such as gross margin pressure and weakness in enterprise routing. The stock is expected to see a positive impact in the short term.
