The transcript for Cisco's third quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call indicates several positive and some challenging aspects that could influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Aspects:
- **Strong Revenue and Earnings Growth**: Cisco reported a 7% year-over-year revenue growth to $12.8 billion, with GAAP EPS up 5% to $0.68 and non-GAAP EPS up 5% to $0.83[1][3][4].
- **Broad-Based Demand**: The company saw strong demand across various product areas, geographies, and customer segments, including a 10% growth in product orders, the highest in nearly a decade[1][3][4].
- **Business Transformation**: Cisco is making significant progress in transforming its business to more recurring revenue streams, with 81% of software revenue sold as subscriptions, up from 76% the previous quarter[1][3][4].
- **Innovation and Acquisitions**: The company is investing heavily in innovation and has made several strategic acquisitions to strengthen its market position, particularly in Webscale, Security, and Applications[1][3][4].

### Challenges:
- **Supply Chain Issues**: Cisco is facing supply chain challenges, including component shortages and higher costs, which have impacted gross margins. These issues are expected to continue through the end of the calendar year[1][3][4].
- **Margin Pressure**: The supply chain challenges have led to a decrease in gross margins, which could continue into the next quarter[1][3][4].

### Short-Term Impact:
Given the strong demand, solid financial performance, and ongoing business transformation, despite the short-term challenges from supply chain issues, the stock is likely to see positive momentum. However, the margin pressure and supply chain challenges might temper some of the enthusiasm.

**Conclusion:**
The overall positive trends in demand, revenue growth, and the company's strategic transformations are expected to outweigh the short-term supply chain challenges. Therefore, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
