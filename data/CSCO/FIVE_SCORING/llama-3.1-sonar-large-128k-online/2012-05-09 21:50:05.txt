Based on the transcript of Cisco Systems' Q3 FY 2012 earnings call, here are the key points that could influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Revenue and Profitability**: Cisco reported solid execution with record revenues, non-GAAP earnings per share, and non-GAAP operating income. However, the guidance for Q4 FY 2012 was cautious, with revenue growth expected to be in the range of 2% to 5% year-over-year, which is relatively weak[5.).

2. **Geographic Performance**: The company saw growth across all geographic regions, but with varying degrees of success. The APJC region showed strong growth, while Europe and India faced challenges[5].

3. **Macro Economic Uncertainty**: The call highlighted significant uncertainty and caution in IT spending, particularly in the enterprise sector, due to global economic concerns and European economic instability. This uncertainty could impact Cisco's near-term performance[5].

4. **Product Performance**: Strong performance in data center and security segments, but challenges in collaboration and video segments. The company is also seeing growth in emerging technologies like cloud and mobility[5].

5. **Cost Management and Efficiency**: Cisco emphasized its focus on operational efficiency, cost savings, and maintaining profitability despite revenue pressures. However, the company is still hiring in strategic areas, indicating a balanced approach[5].

Given these points, the short-term impact on Cisco's stock price is likely to be negative due to the following reasons:

- **Cautious Guidance**: The weak revenue guidance for Q4 FY 2012 and the uncertainty around global economic conditions could lead to investor caution.
- **Macro Economic Concerns**: The ongoing economic challenges and cautious IT spending environment may dampen investor confidence.
- **Segment Challenges**: While some segments like data center and security are performing well, others like collaboration and video are not meeting expectations.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key market and economic conditions.
