The earnings transcript for Cisco Systems, Inc. indicates several key points that could influence the short-term stock price:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Cisco reported record results for Q4 and FY 2013, including revenue growth of 6%, non-GAAP EPS growth of 11%, and strong cash flow from operations. This robust financial performance is generally positive for the stock[2][5].

2. **Conservative Guidance**: Despite the strong results, Cisco provided conservative guidance for Q1 FY 2014, with revenue growth expected in the range of 3% to 5%. This cautious outlook might temper short-term enthusiasm[5].

3. **Workforce Rebalancing**: The announcement of a 4,000-employee reduction (about 5% of the workforce) could lead to short-term market concerns, even though it is part of a broader strategy to rebalance resources towards growth areas[5].

4. **Geographic and Segment Performance**: Mixed results across different geographic and customer segments, such as weakness in APJC and challenging conditions in emerging markets, could add to market uncertainty[5].

5. **Innovation and Market Leadership**: Cisco's continued innovation, strong product portfolio, and market leadership in areas like data center, cloud, and security are positive long-term indicators but may not immediately impact short-term stock performance.

Given these points, the short-term impact on Cisco's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The strong financial performance and long-term strategic positioning are positives, but the conservative guidance and workforce restructuring might introduce some short-term volatility.
