Cisco's Q1 FY2019 earnings call highlights several positive factors that are likely to have a short-term positive impact on the stock price. Here are the key points:

- **Strong Financial Performance**: Cisco reported an 8% year-over-year revenue growth, with product revenue up 9% and non-GAAP EPS increasing by 23%. This strong financial performance indicates robust execution and momentum across various product categories and geographies[5}.
- **Innovation and Strategic Initiatives**: The company has made significant strides in innovation, particularly in areas like intent-based networking, SD-WAN, and cloud security. These initiatives are driving customer adoption and contributing to the company's growth[5].
- **Diversification and Expansion**: Cisco is expanding its portfolio to include more software and subscription-based offerings, which is changing the company's revenue recognition but maintaining long-term value. The integration of recent acquisitions, such as Duo Security, is also positively impacting the business[5].
- **Guidance**: The guidance for Q2 FY2019 is solid, with expected revenue growth of 5% to 7% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS ranging from $0.71 to $0.73. This guidance suggests continued confidence in the company's performance[5].
- **Macro Environment**: Despite some macroeconomic uncertainties, Cisco has not seen significant impacts from tariffs or other global economic factors, and the company remains optimistic about its position and growth opportunities[5].

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
