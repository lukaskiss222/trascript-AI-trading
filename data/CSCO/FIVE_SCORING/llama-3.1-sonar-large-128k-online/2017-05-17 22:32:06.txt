Based on the earnings transcript for Cisco Systems, Inc., here are the key points that influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

- **Revenue Guidance**: Cisco provided a cautious revenue guidance for Q4 FY2017, anticipating a year-over-year decline of 4% to 6%. This guidance is lower than some analysts had anticipated, which could lead to short-term disappointment[1/.
- **Macro and Sector Challenges**: The company faces headwinds from macroeconomic factors, including uncertainty in the U.S. federal sector, emerging markets, and service provider segments. These challenges are expected to continue into Q4[1/.
- **Transition to Software and Subscriptions**: While the transition to more software and subscription-based revenue is showing positive signs (57% growth in software and subscription revenue), it also contributes to the near-term revenue decline due to the deferred revenue model[1/.
- **Operational Performance**: Despite the revenue decline, Cisco maintained strong margins, operating cash flow, and a robust balance sheet. The company also made significant strides in innovation, particularly in security, collaboration, and AI-driven technologies[1/.
- **Analyst Sentiment**: Analysts have noted some concerns about the pricing pressures and the impact of the transition on short-term revenue, but the company's long-term strategy and execution are generally viewed positively.

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the weaker-than-expected revenue guidance and ongoing macroeconomic and sector challenges.
