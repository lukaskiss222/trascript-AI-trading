The transcript of Cisco Systems' Q2 fiscal year 2008 earnings call reveals several key points that could influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Revenue and Guidance**: Cisco reported solid Q2 results with a 16.5% year-over-year revenue increase, but the guidance for Q3 was set at a more conservative 10% year-over-year growth due to economic and market uncertainties. This cautious outlook, particularly the lower-than-expected guidance, might lead to short-term investor caution[3,.

2. **Market and Economic Uncertainties**: The call highlighted concerns about economic challenges in the U.S. and Europe, which have made customers more cautious. However, Cisco's leadership emphasized that these challenges are expected to be short-term and that the company is well-positioned to gain market share during this period[3,.

3. **Strong Product and Geographic Performance**: Despite the cautious guidance, the company reported strong performance across various product categories and geographies, including emerging markets. This balance and growth in key segments could mitigate some of the negative impact from the guidance[3,.

4. **Operational Strength and Cash Position**: Cisco's strong cash position, solid financial performance, and continued investment in new technologies and market adjacencies suggest the company is well-equipped to handle short-term challenges and maintain long-term growth[3,.

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be slightly negative due to the cautious guidance and economic uncertainties, but the company's overall strength and long-term outlook should limit the downside.
