The transcript for Cisco Systems, Inc.'s Q4 and fiscal year 2011 earnings call reveals several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term (1-2 weeks).

### Key Points:
- **Revenue and Orders**: Cisco reported a 3% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4, with strong order growth across key geographies and product segments. However, the guidance for Q1 FY12 is conservative, with expected revenue growth in the range of 1% to 4% year-over-year, which is below the previous quarter's growth rate[5}.
- **Cost Cutting and Restructuring**: Cisco is in the process of reducing its annual operating expenses by $1 billion, which includes workforce reductions and the sale of its set-top box manufacturing facility. These actions are expected to improve operating margins but may cause short-term disruptions[5].
- **Public Sector Challenges**: Public sector spending, particularly in the U.S., remains a challenge, with federal government orders down 18% year-over-year. However, Cisco is realigning resources to focus on growth areas such as data center evolution and cloud services[5].
- **Product Performance**: Switching revenue was down 4% year-over-year, but orders were up 6%. Routing revenue was down 2% year-over-year. New products and services showed strong growth, particularly in data center and video segments[5].
- **Financial Health**: Cisco has a strong balance sheet with $44.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. The company is committed to shareholder value through stock repurchases and dividend payments[5].

### Short-Term Impact:
Given the conservative Q1 FY12 guidance, the ongoing challenges in the public sector, and the short-term disruptions from restructuring, the stock might face some pressure in the immediate term. However, the company's strong balance sheet, solid customer relationships, and positive trends in key product areas like data center and video suggest long-term potential.

### Conclusion:
The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be slightly negative due to the conservative guidance and the immediate effects of restructuring, but the company's overall health and strategic positioning suggest stability and potential for growth.
