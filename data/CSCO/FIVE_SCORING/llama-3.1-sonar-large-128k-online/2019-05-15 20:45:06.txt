Cisco's third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call highlighted several positive aspects that are likely to have a favorable short-term impact on the stock price. Here are the key points:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Cisco reported strong revenue growth of 6%, with product revenue up 7% and non-GAAP EPS up 18%. This indicates robust execution across the business despite macro and geopolitical uncertainties.

2. **Innovation and Product Momentum**: The company showcased significant innovation, particularly in enterprise networking with the launch of WiFi 6 access points and Catalyst 9600 campus core switches. This comprehensive portfolio refresh is expected to drive future growth as customers modernize their infrastructure.

3. **Security Growth**: Cisco's security business saw double-digit growth, driven by a broad-based performance across the entire security portfolio. This segment is becoming increasingly important and is expected to continue contributing to the company's growth.

4. **Guidance and Outlook**: The guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 is positive, with expected revenue growth in the range of 4.5% to 6.5% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS ranging from $0.80 to $0.82. This suggests continued confidence in the company's ability to execute well.

5. **Mitigation of Tariff Impact**: Cisco has effectively managed the impact of the 25% tariffs, reducing their exposure and incorporating the necessary adjustments into their guidance. This minimizes potential negative impacts from trade tensions.

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong financial performance, innovative product launches, and effective management of external challenges.
