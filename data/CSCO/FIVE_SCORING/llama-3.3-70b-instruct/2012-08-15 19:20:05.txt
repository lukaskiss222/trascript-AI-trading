Cisco's Q4 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with the company delivering solid revenue growth of 4% year-over-year, but missing expectations on product orders, which grew only 2% year-over-year. The company's core business, including routing, switching, and security, performed well, while the data center business saw extremely strong growth, with revenue up 90% year-over-year. However, the collaboration and video businesses were weak, with revenue declining 8% and 2%, respectively. Management provided guidance for Q1 FY13, expecting revenue growth of 2-4% year-over-year, with non-GAAP gross margins expected to be in the range of 61-62%. The company also announced a 75% increase in its quarterly dividend and plans to return a minimum of 50% of its free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Overall, while Cisco's results were somewhat disappointing, the company's strong position in the data center market and its commitment to returning capital to shareholders are positives. However, the weak product order growth and declining revenue in certain businesses are concerns.
