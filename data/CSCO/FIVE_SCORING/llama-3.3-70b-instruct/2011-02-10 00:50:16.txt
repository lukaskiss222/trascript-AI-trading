Cisco's Q2 FY11 earnings call revealed mixed signals, with strengths in new product categories like collaboration, data center, and wireless, but challenges in switching and consumer businesses. The company's guidance for Q3 and Q4 FY11 suggests a conservative view of normal seasonality trends, with revenue growth expected to be 4% to 6% year-over-year in Q3 and 8% to 11% in Q4. While the company faces short-term headwinds, its long-term strategy and architectural approach appear to be on track, with a strong focus on innovation, customer satisfaction, and services growth.
