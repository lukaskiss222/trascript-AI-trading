Based on the earnings transcript, Cisco's Q4 results showed a decline in revenue, but the company maintained its profitability and made progress in new market adjacencies. The guidance for Q1 FY10 indicates a year-over-year revenue decline, but a sequential revenue growth. Considering these factors, I predict a neutral short-term impact on the stock price.
