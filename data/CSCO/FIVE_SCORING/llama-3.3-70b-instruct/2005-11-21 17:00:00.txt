Cisco's Q1 results showed solid performance, with 10% year-over-year revenue growth and pro forma EPS increasing 19%. The company's focus on advanced technologies, commercial market segment, and emerging markets is paying off, with strong growth in these areas. However, the European market was slower than expected, and the company faces concerns about global economic activity and capital spending. Despite these concerns, Cisco's guidance for Q2 and fiscal year 2006 remains positive, with expected revenue growth of 8-9% year-over-year in Q2 and 10-12% for the full year.
