Cisco's Q3 fiscal year 2009 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with the company generating $8.2 billion in revenue, a 17% year-over-year decrease. Despite the challenging revenue environment, the company's financial model enabled it to effectively manage gross margin, with non-GAAP gross margin coming in at 55.1%, above guidance. The company also reduced non-GAAP operating expenses by 11% quarter-over-quarter, driven by decreases in variable compensation, sales commission expenses, and discretionary expenses.

John Chambers, Cisco's CEO, emphasized the company's ability to execute and innovate in 29 new market adjacencies, while also reducing expenses. He highlighted the company's progress in areas such as virtualization, video architecture, and collaboration, and noted that customers are beginning to understand the benefits of Cisco's vision and strategy.

The company provided guidance for Q4, with revenue expected to decrease 17-20% year-over-year. However, Chambers emphasized that the company is well-positioned for long-term growth, with a strong financial model, a talented workforce, and a robust product portfolio.

Given the mixed results and the company's efforts to reduce expenses and invest in new markets, I predict a neutral short-term impact on the stock price.
