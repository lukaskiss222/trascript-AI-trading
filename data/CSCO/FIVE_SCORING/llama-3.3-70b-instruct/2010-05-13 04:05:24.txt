Cisco's Q3 fiscal year 2010 earnings call revealed strong financial results, with revenue growth of 27% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share increasing by 40%. The company's innovation engine is driving growth, with new product introductions and acquisitions contributing to its success. However, management's guidance for Q4 suggests a slight deceleration in growth, with revenue expected to increase by 25% to 28% year-over-year. This guidance is still above the company's long-term growth projections of 12% to 17%, and the company remains optimistic about its prospects.

The company's strong performance and optimistic guidance suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
