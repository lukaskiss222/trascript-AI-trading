Cisco's Q2 FY13 earnings results showed solid profitable growth, with record revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share. The company's execution on its financial model is strong, with stable gross margins and operating expenses growing in line with revenue growth. However, the guidance for Q3 FY13 is cautious, with revenue growth expected to be in the range of 4% to 6% year-over-year. The company's focus on innovation, portfolio management, and operational discipline is expected to continue driving profitable growth.

Given the mixed results and cautious guidance, I predict a neutral short-term impact on the stock price.
