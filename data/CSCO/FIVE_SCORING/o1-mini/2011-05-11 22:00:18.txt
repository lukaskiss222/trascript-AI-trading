Cisco's Q3 results show modest revenue growth but a decline in net income and flat non-GAAP EPS, coupled with cautious Q4 guidance indicating potential short-term challenges. While the introduction of dividends and stock repurchases are positive, the ongoing restructuring and margin pressures may overshadow these benefits in the near term. Overall, the stock is likely to face downward pressure in the coming weeks.
