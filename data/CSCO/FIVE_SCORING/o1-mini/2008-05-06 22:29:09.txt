Cisco demonstrated solid performance in Q3 with revenue and non-GAAP earnings surpassing expectations, driven by strong growth in emerging markets like China and India. While the US market showed slower growth and Q4 guidance was slightly conservative, the company's strategic expansions and continued stock repurchases suggest confidence in maintaining its long-term growth trajectory. These factors likely support a modest positive impact on Ciscoâ€™s stock in the short term.
