Cisco reported solid quarterly growth with revenues up 4% and non-GAAP EPS increasing by 10%, driven by strong adoption of their intent-based networking and subscription services. Despite some margin pressures from higher memory costs and integration expenses from acquisitions, the positive guidance for the next quarter and strategic initiatives suggest confidence in continued performance. The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
