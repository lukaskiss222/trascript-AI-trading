Cisco reported solid Q3 results with revenue and earnings growth exceeding last year, supported by strong performance in services and strategic product expansions. Despite a cautious outlook due to macroeconomic uncertainties, the guidance remains positive with continued EPS growth and shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks. This balance of strong current performance and prudent future expectations is likely to result in a positive short-term impact on the stock.
