Based on the earnings transcript, Cisco Systems' stock price is likely to face short-term pressure due to the following factors:

1. **Weakened Service Provider Orders**: The company reported a 12% decline in service provider orders, which is a significant portion of its business. This weakness is primarily attributed to macroeconomic uncertainty, political and regulatory environments, and currency challenges.

2. **Moderate Revenue Growth**: Despite the challenges in the service provider segment, Cisco's overall revenue growth was only 1% year-over-year. This modest growth rate may not be sufficient to satisfy investor expectations.

3. **Guidance**: The company's guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 projects revenue to decline in the range of -2% to -4% year-over-year, which is a significant downgrade from previous quarters. This conservative guidance indicates that the company expects continued challenges in the service provider segment.

4. **Portfolio and Acquisitions**: While the company has been investing in key priority areas such as security, collaboration, and data centers, the pace of acquisitions has slowed down. This could indicate that the company is focusing more on internal innovation and organic growth.

5. **Macroeconomic Uncertainty**: The uncertainty surrounding the economy, political environment, and regulatory changes could continue to impact Cisco's business and stock price.

Given these factors, the short-term impact on Cisco's stock price is likely to be negative. The company's guidance and the challenges in the service provider segment suggest that the stock may face further pressure in the coming weeks.

**Rating: -1**
