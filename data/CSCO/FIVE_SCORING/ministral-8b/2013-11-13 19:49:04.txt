**Analysis:**

Cisco Systems reported a strong Q1 FYâ€™14 with record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.53, but revenue growth of 2% year-over-year, which was below expectations. The company highlighted several challenges, including emerging market weakness, product transitions, and service provider issues. Management provided guidance for the second quarter, expecting revenue to decline by 8% to 10% year-over-year. The company is focused on managing through these cycles and driving long-term growth.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the revenue guidance and the challenges highlighted by management. However, the company's long-term strategy and execution are strong, and the stock may see a bounce-back if the market sentiment improves.

**Rating:** -1
