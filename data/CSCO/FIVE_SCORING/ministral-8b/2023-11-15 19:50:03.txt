**Analysis:**

Cisco's Q1 results were strong, with revenue and profitability exceeding expectations. However, the company is facing a temporary slowdown in new orders due to customers taking time to implement their heightened product deliveries. This is expected to last for one to two quarters, leading to lower revenue in Q2. Despite this, management remains confident in the company's long-term growth prospects, particularly in AI and security. The Splunk acquisition is also expected to drive growth and improve the company's software capabilities. Overall, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the expected revenue slowdown in Q2, but long-term investors should remain optimistic about the company's growth opportunities.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the expected revenue slowdown in Q2. However, long-term investors should remain optimistic about the company's growth prospects. Rating: -1
