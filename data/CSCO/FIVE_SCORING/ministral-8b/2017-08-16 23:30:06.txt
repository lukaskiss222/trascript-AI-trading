### Analysis

The earnings call for Cisco Systems, Inc. revealed a mixed bag of results. The company achieved record annual sales and earnings, but also faced challenges such as a pause in switching revenue and a decline in gross margin due to memory pricing. However, the company's management expressed optimism about the future, particularly with the launch of the new Network Intuitive platform and the strong reception of the new Catalyst 9000 switches. Additionally, the company's security business showed strong order growth and deferred revenue growth. Overall, the call highlighted Cisco's ongoing transition to a more software-driven business model and its commitment to innovation.

### Conclusion

Given the mixed results and the company's continued focus on innovation and transition, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the margin volatility and the pause in switching revenue. However, the long-term potential of the new Network Intuitive platform and the strong security business could lead to a rally in the stock over the next few weeks.
