**Analysis:**

Cisco's Q3 2020 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results. The company reported a decline in revenue due to the global pandemic, with a significant impact on infrastructure platforms and commercial orders. However, the company also highlighted strong growth in applications and security, driven by the surge in demand for remote work solutions. The management team expressed confidence in the company's long-term prospects, citing strong balance sheet, healthy cash flow, and a diversified portfolio. The company also announced a $2.5 billion financing program to support customers' business continuity.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on Cisco's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The company's strong balance sheet and healthy cash flow provide a buffer against the economic downturn. The financing program also demonstrates the company's commitment to supporting its customers during this challenging time. However, the decline in revenue and the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic may weigh on the stock in the short term. Overall, the stock is likely to remain range-bound in the near term, with potential upside if the company's long-term prospects materialize.
