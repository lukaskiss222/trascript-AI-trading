**Analysis:**

Cisco Systems reported strong Q3 2018 earnings, with revenue up 4% and non-GAAP EPS up 10%. The company's growth was driven by accelerating revenue growth in its intent-based networking portfolio and strong demand for its new Catalyst 9000 products. However, the company faced challenges with service provider routing and memory prices. The company's guidance for Q4 2018 was in line with expectations, with revenue expected to grow 4% to 6% year-over-year. The company's stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the uncertainty around service provider routing and memory prices, but the company's long-term growth prospects remain strong.

**Conclusion:**

The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the challenges with service provider routing and memory prices, but the company's long-term growth prospects remain strong. The stock is expected to experience a neutral impact in the next 1-2 weeks.
