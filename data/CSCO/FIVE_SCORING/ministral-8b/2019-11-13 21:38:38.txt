### Short-Term Impact on Ciscoâ€™s Stock

Cisco's Q1 earnings call revealed a challenging macroeconomic environment, with revenue growth of 2% and double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth. However, the company highlighted broad-based weakness across geographies and product segments, particularly in enterprise and commercial markets. Management indicated that this weakness is expected to continue into the next quarter, with guidance projecting a decline in revenue of 3% to 5% year-over-year. Despite these challenges, Cisco's focus on software transition and innovation, as well as its strong pipeline of new products, suggests a long-term growth trajectory. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the lowered guidance and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, but the company's strategic positioning and execution may lead to a rebound in the long run.
