Based on the earnings transcript, Cisco Systems reported strong quarterly results with revenue growth of 6% and double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth. However, the company's guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was weaker than expected, with revenue growth projected to be in the range of 0% to 2% year-over-year. This was primarily due to continued challenges in the service provider segment and a slight macro shift in July. The company also highlighted the importance of its software subscription business in driving long-term growth and maintaining margins. Overall, while the company's results were strong, the weaker-than-expected guidance and the challenges in the service provider segment may weigh on the stock in the short term.
