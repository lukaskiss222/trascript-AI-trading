### Analysis

Cisco Systems, Inc. reported its Q2 fiscal 2020 results, which were largely in line with expectations. The company highlighted strong performance in infrastructure platforms, security, and applications, despite a challenging macro environment. The key takeaways include:

1. **Revenue and Margin Performance**: Total revenue was down 4%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 33.7%, up 1.6 points year-over-year. This indicates a strong margin performance despite the revenue decline.
2. **Segment Performance**: Infrastructure platforms, security, and applications showed resilience, while service provider revenue declined due to ongoing market challenges.

5. **5G and Future Growth**: The company emphasized its long-term growth opportunities in 5G, Wi-Fi 6, and the cloud, expecting these trends to drive future growth.
6. **Macroeconomic Uncertainty**: The company acknowledged the pause in customer spending due to macro uncertainty but expects a recovery as technology remains at the heart of customer needs.

The short-term (1â€“2 weeks) impact on Cisco's stock is likely to be mixed, with potential positive sentiment from the solid financial performance and resilient margins.
