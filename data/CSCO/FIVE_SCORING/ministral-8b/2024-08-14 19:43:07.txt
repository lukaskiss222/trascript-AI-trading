The company delivered $13.6 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter and $53.8 billion for the full year, with significant growth in annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations, and subscription revenue. The gross margin of 67.5% was the highest for Cisco in 20 years, and the company generated excellent margins boosted by Splunk. The company also saw steady demand with total product order growth of 14% and growth of 6% excluding Splunk, indicating that the period of inventory digestion by our customers is now largely behind us as we expected. The company continues to invest in key areas such as AI and cybersecurity, with significant growth in AI orders and strong demand for security products. The company also announced a restructuring plan to focus on growth and efficiency, with a target of $55 billion to $56.2 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2025 and a non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.52 to $3.58. The company also expects to impact approximately 7% of its global workforce with total estimated pre-tax charges of up to $1 billion. Overall, the company's results and guidance suggest a positive outlook for the short-term, with strong demand and growth in key areas. However, the company's stock may face short-term pressure due to the ongoing restructuring and potential headwinds in the market.
