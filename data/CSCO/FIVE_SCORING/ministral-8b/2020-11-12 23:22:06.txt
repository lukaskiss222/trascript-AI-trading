### Analysis:

The earnings call for Cisco Systems, Inc. in Q1 of fiscal year 2021 revealed a mix of positive and negative signals. The company reported a 9% year-over-year decrease in total revenue to $11.9 billion, driven primarily by a 16% decline in infrastructure platforms. However, there were encouraging signs in the commercial and security segments, with collaboration and security solutions showing strong growth. The company's focus on innovation, particularly in the hybrid cloud and security areas, was highlighted, along with plans for future growth. The transition to a software and subscription-driven model is ongoing, with software subscriptions now accounting for 78% of total software revenue. The company also announced the appointment of Scott Herren as the new CFO, who brings experience in software and business model transformation. Overall, the call provided a balanced view of Cisco's performance and future prospects.

### Conclusion:

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The company's strong performance in certain segments, along with its focus on innovation and growth, provides a positive outlook. However, the overall revenue decline and the challenges in the infrastructure platforms segment may cause some temporary pressure on the stock. The appointment of a new CFO may also provide a sense of continuity and stability, which could be positive for the stock.
