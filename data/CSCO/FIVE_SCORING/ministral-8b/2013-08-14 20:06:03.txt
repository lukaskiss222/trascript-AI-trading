**Analysis:**
Cisco Systems reported strong Q4 and FY 2013 results, with record revenues of $12.4 billion and record non-GAAP operating income. Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, Cisco maintained consistent growth and profitability. The company's strategic focus on cloud, mobility, and security has led to strong performance in these areas. However, the company's guidance for Q1 FY 2014 was slightly below expectations, with revenue growth projected at 3% to 5% year-over-year. The company also announced a workforce rebalancing plan, which includes layoffs and reallocations, to align resources with growth opportunities and improve operational efficiency. The company's strong momentum in the U.S. enterprise and commercial markets, as well as its leadership in the data center and wireless LAN markets, suggest that Cisco is well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory. However, the company's guidance for Q1 FY 2014 and the workforce rebalancing plan may cause some short-term uncertainty and volatility in the stock price.

**Conclusion:**
Given the strong performance and strategic focus of Cisco, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to the guidance and workforce rebalancing plan. The company's long-term growth prospects and market leadership position suggest that the stock price may recover and potentially rally in the longer term. However, the short-term impact is likely to be negative.

**Rating:**
