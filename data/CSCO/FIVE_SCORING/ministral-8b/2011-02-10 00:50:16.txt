Based on the transcript, Cisco Systems reported mixed results for Q2 FY 2011, with revenue growing 6% year-over-year to $10.4 billion, slightly above guidance. However, non-GAAP EPS decreased 8% year-over-year to $0.37, driven by lower gross margins and increased operating expenses. The company's new product categories, such as collaboration and data center virtualization, showed strong growth. However, switching revenues declined 7% year-over-year, and the company expects to see further declines in the coming quarters. The company also expects to see a decrease in gross margins in the coming quarters due to the transition to new products. Overall, the company's financial performance was mixed, with some areas of strength and others that need improvement. The company's long-term growth targets remain at 12% to 17%, but the company expects to see a decrease in gross margins in the coming quarters due to the transition to new products. The company's focus will be on improving gross margins and increasing efficiency in its operations. The company's stock price may experience short-term volatility due to the mixed results and the company's focus on improving gross margins.
