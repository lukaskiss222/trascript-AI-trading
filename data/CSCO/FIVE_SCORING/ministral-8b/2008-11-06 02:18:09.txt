### Analysis

Cisco Systems reported a solid Q1 2009 despite the challenging global economic environment. The company's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) were up year-over-year, but order growth slowed significantly, particularly in the US and Europe, and the company expects a further decline in Q2. The management team is implementing a six-point plan to navigate through the downturn, focusing on cost savings, resource realignment, and strategic investments. The company's strong balance sheet and cash position provide a competitive advantage, and it expects to maintain its long-term growth targets. The stock may face pressure in the short term due to the economic uncertainty and guidance downgrade, but the company's strong fundamentals and execution may lead to a recovery in the medium term.
