**Short-term (1â€“2 weeks) impact on the stock price:**

The earnings call provided a positive outlook for Cisco's growth prospects, driven by strong demand across its portfolio and geographies. However, the company's guidance for Q4 revenue growth was lower than expected, and the impact of supply chain challenges on gross margins was also a concern. These factors could lead to short-term volatility in the stock price, but the overall positive outlook should provide support for the stock in the long term. Given the mixed signals, the stock is likely to experience some short-term volatility but is expected to rally in the long term.
