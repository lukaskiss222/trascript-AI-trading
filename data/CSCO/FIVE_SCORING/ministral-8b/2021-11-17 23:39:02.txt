### Analysis

Cisco's Q1 results were mixed, with strong order growth and revenue growth, but were impacted by supply chain constraints and higher costs. The company's focus on subscription-based software revenue and innovation was highlighted, but the transition from hardware to software is still ongoing. The company's guidance for Q2 and the full year was impacted by these factors, and the company continues to face uncertainty due to the Delta variant and global component shortages. Despite these challenges, the company's strong order momentum and backlog suggest that the supply chain issues will eventually be resolved, and the company remains confident in its long-term growth prospects.

### Conclusion

The stock is likely to experience short-term volatility due to the mixed results and supply chain challenges, but the company's strong order momentum and backlog suggest that the stock could rally in the short term as the supply chain issues are resolved. The company's focus on software and innovation also suggests long-term growth potential. Overall, the stock is likely to experience short-term volatility, but the company's strong fundamentals and long-term growth prospects suggest that the stock could rally in the short term.
