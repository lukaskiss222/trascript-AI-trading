### Analysis:

Cisco's Q3 and FY 2011 earnings call revealed a mixed performance. The company reported strong revenue growth in key areas such as collaboration, data center, and emerging markets. However, switching and public sector segments faced challenges, leading to a decline in revenue and gross margins. The management team acknowledged these issues and outlined a strategic plan to address them, including simplifying the organization and operating model, aligning cost structures, and divesting underperforming operations. The guidance for Q4 and FY 2012 projects a revenue growth of 2% year-over-year and an operating margin of 24% to 25%. The company also announced a $1 billion expense reduction plan, which includes a voluntary early retirement program. The management's tone was optimistic, and they expressed confidence in Cisco's ability to navigate the challenges and emerge stronger.

### Conclusion:

The stock is likely to face some short-term pressure due to the challenges in the switching and public sector segments and the uncertainty around the restructuring plan. However, the company's strategic plan and strong leadership position in key markets suggest long-term potential. The stock may experience a slight negative impact in the short term, but it is likely to recover as the company executes its plan and demonstrates progress in addressing its challenges.
