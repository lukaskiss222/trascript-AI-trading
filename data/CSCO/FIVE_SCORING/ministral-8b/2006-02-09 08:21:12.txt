**Short-term implications:**

- **Positive outlook:** The company reported strong order growth and revenue, with a year-over-year product order growth rate of 10 to 15% and revenue growth of 10 to 12%. This indicates a positive outlook for the near term.
- **Lean manufacturing transition:** The company is transitioning to a lean manufacturing model, which could lead to cost savings and increased efficiency in the long term.
