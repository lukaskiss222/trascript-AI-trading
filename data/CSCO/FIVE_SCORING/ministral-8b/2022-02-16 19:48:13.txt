### Analysis

Cisco's Q2 results were strong, with double-digit product order growth and robust revenue growth, despite ongoing supply chain challenges. The company's focus on hybrid work, hybrid cloud, and digital transformation is driving demand, and the company is well-positioned to capture this growth. The strong order momentum suggests that the backlog will continue to convert into revenue over the next several quarters. However, the company's gross margins may remain compressed due to supply chain costs and component shortages. The company's guidance for the third quarter is in line with expectations, and the outlook for the full year remains positive. Overall, the results suggest that Cisco is well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory despite the challenges in the supply chain.

### Conclusion

The short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on Cisco's stock price is likely to be positive, as the company's strong Q2 results and optimistic outlook for the future should outweigh the concerns about supply chain issues and component shortages. The company's focus on growth areas such as hybrid work, hybrid cloud, and digital transformation is likely to continue driving demand for its products and services.
