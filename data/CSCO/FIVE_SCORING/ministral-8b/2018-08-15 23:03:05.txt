### Analysis

Cisco Systems reported strong Q4 results, with revenue and EPS beating expectations, driven by broad-based growth across the portfolio. The company's focus on innovation, particularly in multi-cloud environments and security, has continued to pay off. The acquisition of Duo Security will further enhance Cisco's security offerings. However, there are some concerns, such as the potential impact of the new revenue recognition standard (ASC 606) and the headwinds from subscription transitions.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive due to the strong Q4 results and the company's clear strategy for growth. The guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 is also encouraging, with expected revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7%. The stock is likely to see a rally in the next 1-2 weeks.
