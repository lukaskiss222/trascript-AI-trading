Based on the earnings transcript, here's my analysis of Cisco's likely short-term stock impact:

Key Positives:
- Strong growth in strategic areas like collaboration (39% YoY) and data center (31% YoY)
- Taking decisive action on cost structure with $1B in planned expense reductions
- Healthy gross margins at 63.9% for Q3

Key Concerns:
- Weak Q4 guidance of flat to 2% growth
- Ongoing challenges in switching business with revenue down 9% YoY
- Major restructuring and workforce reductions ahead
- Public sector weakness continuing (down 8% YoY)

The weak near-term guidance combined with significant organizational disruption from the restructuring is likely to pressure the stock over the next 1-2 weeks, despite some positive longer-term strategic moves. The magnitude of the expense reductions and organizational changes creates execution risk that investors will likely want to see play out before becoming more constructive.
