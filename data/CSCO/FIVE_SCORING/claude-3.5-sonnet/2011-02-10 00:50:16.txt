Based on the earnings transcript, I anticipate a negative short-term impact on Cisco's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. While the company hit revenue targets and showed strong growth in some new product areas (data center, collaboration), there are several concerning factors:

1. Gross margin pressure from product transitions and mix shifts, dropping to 62.4% from 64.3% last quarter
2. Guidance indicates continued margin pressure and slower growth than historically targeted
3. Consumer segment weakness and challenges in switching transition execution

The management team's cautious tone regarding margins and execution challenges, combined with the need to realign resources and control expenses, suggests near-term headwinds that will likely pressure the stock.
