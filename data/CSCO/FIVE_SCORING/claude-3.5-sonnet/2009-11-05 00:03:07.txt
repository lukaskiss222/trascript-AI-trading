Based on the earnings transcript, here's my analysis of the likely 1-2 week impact on Cisco's stock:

The transcript reveals several strong positives including:
- Better than expected Q1 revenue ($9B vs guidance of -15-17% YoY)
- Strong sequential growth and improving year-over-year trends 
- US Enterprise dramatically improved from -20% YoY to +10% YoY
- Healthy Q2 guidance of 1-4% YoY growth
- Strong gross margins at 66.3%

However, there are some cautionary elements:
- Management explicitly warning not to extrapolate strong near-term trends
- Expected gross margin decline in Q2 to 64-65%
- Supply chain constraints and extended lead times
- Continued weakness in emerging markets

Given the clearly improving business trends, strong execution, and positive guidance balanced against management's deliberate tempering of expectations, I expect a moderately positive short-term stock reaction.
