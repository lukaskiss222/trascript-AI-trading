Based on the earnings call transcript, here is my analysis of the likely short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on Cisco's stock:

Key Positive Factors:
- Strong Q3 results with 18% revenue growth and record earnings
- Commercial and enterprise segments showing robust growth
- Product order growth outpacing revenue growth 
- Optimistic guidance for Q4 with 18-21% expected revenue growth
- Management expressed high confidence in business momentum

Key Concerns:
- Some caution around European market growth 
- Conservative commentary around Q1 FY07 seasonality
- Operating expenses expected to rise 7-8% sequentially
- Some peer companies showing weakness that could eventually impact Cisco

Overall Assessment:
The strong Q3 performance, healthy guidance, and management's confident tone suggest Cisco remains well-positioned for continued growth. While there are some minor concerns, the overall momentum and market leadership position should drive positive stock performance in the near-term.
