Based on the detailed earnings call transcript, Cisco reported an exceptionally strong quarter with broad-based growth across geographies, products, and customer segments. Key positives include:

1. Revenue grew 8% YoY to $9.8B, significantly above guidance of 1-4% growth
2. Strong product order growth of 11% YoY with balanced performance across enterprise, service provider, and commercial segments
3. Management expressed high confidence in sustainable recovery and long-term growth outlook of 12-17%
4. Significant hiring plans (2,000-3,000 new employees) indicating confidence in growth
5. Solid traction in new growth areas like UCS, Nexus switches, and consumer products

The company's cautiously optimistic guidance of 23-26% growth for next quarter, while seemingly conservative given momentum, reflects prudent management. Overall, the results and commentary suggest Cisco is executing extremely well and positioned for strong growth as the recovery continues.
