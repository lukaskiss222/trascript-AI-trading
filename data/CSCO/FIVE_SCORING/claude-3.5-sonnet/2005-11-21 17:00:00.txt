Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis for Cisco's short-term (1-2 weeks) stock impact:

Key Positives:
- Solid Q1 with 10% revenue growth and balanced performance across segments
- Strong commercial market growth (mid-20s)
- Healthy US market with 15% order growth
- Good execution in Asia-Pacific with 30% growth

Key Concerns:
- European market weakness, particularly in major markets like UK, Germany, France
- Lower guidance for Q2 revenue growth (8-9% vs 10% in Q1)
- Operating expenses expected to trend up slightly
- Some uncertainty around Japan market

Overall, while the company showed decent execution and growth in most regions, the combination of European weakness and conservative Q2 guidance is likely to create some near-term pressure on the stock. The market typically reacts negatively to signs of slowing growth and increased expenses.
