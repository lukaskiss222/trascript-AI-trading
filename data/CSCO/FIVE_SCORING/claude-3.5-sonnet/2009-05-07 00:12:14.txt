Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess a moderately positive short-term outlook for Cisco's stock. Key positives include:
1. Management noted business stabilization and consistent order rates across months for the first time in several quarters
2. Strong execution on cost controls with expenses reduced beyond targets
3. Strategic positioning in growth areas like video, cloud, and virtualization

However, some cautions include continued year-over-year revenue declines (-17-20% guidance) and uncertain timing of recovery. The overall tone suggests business is stabilizing at lower levels with gradual improvement expected.
