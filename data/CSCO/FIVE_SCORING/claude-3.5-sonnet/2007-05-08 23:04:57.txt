Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Cisco's stock price. Key positives include:

1. Strong revenue growth of 21% year-over-year, exceeding guidance, with balanced performance across geographies and segments.

2. Healthy service provider and commercial business momentum, particularly in Scientific-Atlanta (30% growth) and emerging markets (40% growth).

3. Confident forward guidance of 15-16% year-over-year growth, above long-term target range, indicating management's optimism about near-term business trends.

The only minor concern is softer US enterprise spending, but this is well understood by the market and offset by strength in other areas. Management's confident tone and strong execution suggest the stock should react positively in the coming 1-2 weeks.
