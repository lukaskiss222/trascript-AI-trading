Based on this earnings call transcript, I assess a positive short-term impact on Cisco's stock price. Key positives include:

1. Strong execution with record revenue, operating income and net income, beating expectations across metrics
2. Improving order trends across all customer segments and geographies, particularly 13% growth in emerging markets
3. Data center momentum with 77% growth and successful execution in cloud/software initiatives
4. Solid gross margins at 63% and strong cash flows with increased shareholder returns
5. Management's confident tone and constructive guidance for next quarter

While there are some minor concerns around European markets and federal spending, the overall trajectory and execution appear strong, with momentum building in key growth areas.
