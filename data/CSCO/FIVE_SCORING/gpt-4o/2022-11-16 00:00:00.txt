Cisco Systems reported a strong fiscal Q1 2023, exceeding the high end of its guidance for both revenue and non-GAAP EPS, owing to better-than-expected product shipments and easing supply constraints. The company raised its full-year revenue guidance, reflecting confidence stemming from its robust backlog, recurring revenue streams, and improved supply situation. Despite some regional caution, notably in Europe, and a sequential decline in orders, the performance metrics and strategic shifts towards software and subscription-based models suggest positive investor sentiment. The increased visibility and predictability from these measures point to a likely short-term stock rally.
