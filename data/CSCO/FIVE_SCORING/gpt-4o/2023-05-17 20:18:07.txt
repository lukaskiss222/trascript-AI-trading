Cisco Systems reported a strong Q3 performance with record revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share, exceeding the high-end of their guidance. The company raised its fiscal 2023 outlook and anticipates modest revenue growth in fiscal 2024. Management highlighted strategic focus areas including transitioning to more subscriptions, security, and integrating AI capabilities, which show promise for sustainable growth. Despite a sequential slowdown in orders related to supply chain dynamics and macroeconomic conditions, the near-term outlook and operational achievements suggest a positive short-term impact on Ciscoâ€™s stock price.
