Cisco Systems reported a relatively strong Q4 with revenue and earnings slightly exceeding expectations. While the company demonstrated solid order growth in key geographies and product segments like routing and switching, concerns remain regarding public sector spending, which showed a decline. The restructuring efforts to simplify operations and focus on cost reduction appear to be a step in the right direction, positioning Cisco to better compete. However, the company's cautious guidance for Q1 FY '12, reflecting a challenging macro environment and internal restructuring impacts, suggests some short-term pressures on the stock.
