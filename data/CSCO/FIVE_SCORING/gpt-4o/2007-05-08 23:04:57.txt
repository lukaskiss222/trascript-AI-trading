Cisco Systems, Inc.'s earning call for Q3 of fiscal year 2007 indicates strong financial performance, with record revenue and solid growth across most segments. The company's guidance suggests continued confidence, with projected growth beyond historical expectations. Management's focus on strategic diversification and the successful integration of Scientific-Atlanta are positive signs.

Overall, the upbeat guidance and strong execution in emerging markets and service providers point to a positive short-term outlook for the stock.
