Cisco Systems, Inc. reported strong Q2 2023 results, surpassing expectations and providing an optimistic guidance, driven by steady demand, improved supply chain conditions, and a rising shift towards recurring revenue. Management's confident tone was underlined by sequential growth in key markets, a notable rise in software and subscription revenue, and enhanced visibility due to a robust backlog and remaining performance obligations.
