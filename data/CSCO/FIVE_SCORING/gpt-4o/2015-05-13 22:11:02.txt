Cisco Systems delivered solid Q3 2015 performance with revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 5% and 6% respectively. The company demonstrated robust U.S. commercial and enterprise performance but continues to face challenges in the global service provider and emerging markets sectors. With optimistic guidance for modest Q4 growth and emphasis on transitioning to a software-driven revenue model, Cisco aims to strengthen its recurring revenue streams. Despite some headwinds, the positive momentum in software and switching, combined with management optimism, could lead to a short-term positive impact on the stock.
