Cisco Systems, Inc. reported a strong quarter, demonstrating broad-based revenue growth across all geographies and product categories. The company’s strategic transition towards software and subscription offerings is yielding positive results, reflected in their double-digit EPS growth and strong orders. While the outlook for the next quarter remains robust with continued growth expectations, the management exhibited cautious optimism due to macroeconomic uncertainties, including potential impacts from tariffs. Nonetheless, the strong performance, coupled with innovations and strategic changes, likely bodes well for Cisco’s stock in the short-term.
