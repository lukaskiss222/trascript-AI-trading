Cisco's Q2 fiscal year 2011 results showed a 6% year-over-year revenue increase and a slight beat on the earnings per share guidance. However, challenges were noted in switching revenues, gross margin pressures, and consumer business performance. Despite growth in service provider and enterprise markets, concerns about government sector spending and competitive pressures in routing and switching remain. The company's guidance for Q3 and Q4 reflects optimism for sequential revenue growth, but market share and margin challenges may dampen short-term stock performance.
