Cisco Systems’ earnings call revealed a mixed short-term outlook. While the company showed strong performance in areas like security and recurring revenue growth, the decline in product orders, particularly due to a 12% drop in service provider orders, poses immediate challenges. The guidance for the next quarter anticipates a revenue decline of 2% to 4%, attributed mainly to continued weakness in service provider capital expenditures. Despite robust deferred revenue growth from software and subscriptions, the short-term impact of the service provider challenges and macroeconomic uncertainties may apply negative pressure on Cisco’s stock in the next 1–2 weeks.
