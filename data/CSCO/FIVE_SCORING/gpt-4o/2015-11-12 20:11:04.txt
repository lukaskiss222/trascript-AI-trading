Cisco reported strong Q1 results but issued a conservative Q2 guidance slightly below market expectations due to macro uncertainties and lower than expected order growth outside the U.S. Management emphasized confidence in their business strategy, highlighting growth in new product introductions and strategic partnerships. The shift to software subscription and cloud-based models is showing traction, contributing to deferred revenue growth. Despite the cautious guidance, Cisco's robust execution and strategic positioning suggest potential resilience and could stabilize the stock in the short term.
