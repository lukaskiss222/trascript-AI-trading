Cisco Systems reported strong financial results for Q1 2007, with record revenues and profits, 25% year-over-year revenue growth, and a notable contribution from Scientific-Atlanta. Management highlighted robust order growth, particularly in the service provider segment, supported by next-generation network build-outs and product diversification. The CEO described solid performance across geographies and customer segments, along with optimistic full-year guidance, suggesting sustained momentum beyond traditional markets. These factors, alongside a positive market response, are likely to boost Cisco's stock price in the short term.
