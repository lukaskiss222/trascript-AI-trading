Cisco's Q1 fiscal 2018 earnings call highlighted several positive developments, including a shift towards a subscription-based model and increased software and recurring revenue, particularly in security and collaboration segments. The guidance for modest revenue growth in Q2 suggests optimism for the company's strategic initiatives, such as intent-based networking and partnerships with major cloud providers, like Google. The strong adoption of newer products like Catalyst 9000 and continued momentum in security indicate a potential to exceed short-term growth expectations, which could positively influence the stock in the near term.
