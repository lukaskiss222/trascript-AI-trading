Cisco Systems delivered strong Q4 FY13 results with record revenues and non-GAAP earnings, surpassing guidance midpoints even in a challenging macroeconomic environment. The company showcased growth in key segments such as wireless and data center, although it noted struggles in regions like APJC and Japan. While the upcoming employee restructuring suggests a focus on maintaining profitability and agility, the consistent return to shareholders and leadership in technology transitions like cloud and mobility indicate a robust strategic position. Given the positive results and strategic positioning, Cisco's stock could likely experience a modest short-term rally despite broader economic uncertainties.
