Cisco Systems, Inc. reported strong Q4 results with a 10% year-over-year revenue increase, marking their first $10 billion quarter. Despite solid performance, guidance for the first half of fiscal year 2009 indicates a slowdown, with expected revenue growth at 8% and 8.5% for Q1 and Q2, respectively. This caution is primarily due to uncertainties in the service provider sector and broader macroeconomic concerns, which may weigh on the stock in the short term. The company's confidence in maintaining long-term growth prospects remains, but the tempered near-term expectations may lead to pressure on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks.
