Cisco Systems reported strong performance for its fiscal year, with notable growth in non-GAAP earnings per share and revenue both hitting record numbers. The strategic positioning in intelligent networks, successful expansion in service provider markets, and significant involvement in high-profile events like the London Olympics have reinforced Cisco's leadership. Management's tone was positive, highlighting confidence in operational execution and shareholder value enhancement. With a robust dividend increase and plans to return a large portion of free cash flow to shareholders, Cisco's outlook suggests stability and potential growth, likely resulting in a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
