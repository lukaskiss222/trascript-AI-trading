Cisco's Q4 and fiscal year earnings call delivered mixed signals, with substantial year-over-year revenue growth (13% for the year and 10% for Q4), particularly strong enterprise growth in the US, and optimism towards long-term growth targets offset by cautious guidance for the first half-quarters of 2009, a decline in service provider growth rates, and the acknowledgment of macro-economic challenges. The focus on new market adjacencies, investments in R&D, particularly in emerging technologies, and the guidance to increase expenses for future innovation indicate a positive long-term outlook, but the near-term guidance of 8% to 8.5% growth suggests short-term conservatism, likely causing a moderate impact on stock price.
