Cisco Systems reported a very strong Q4 fiscal 2007 with record revenues and improved gross margins, showcasing balanced growth across products, geographies, and customer segments. The company's strategic focus on advanced technologies, like unified communications (including TelePresence) and its expansion into new markets, signals potential for sustained growth. Management's optimism, coupled with raised long-term growth projections, suggests positive stock impact in the short term, as the market could react favorably to Cisco's execution and vision for the future. However, the uncertainty in U.S. enterprise spending might temper some enthusiasm. Overall, the market likely views these results as a positive sign, leading to a potential rally.
