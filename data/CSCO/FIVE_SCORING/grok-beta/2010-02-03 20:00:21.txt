Ciscoâ€™s Q2 FY10 results were exceptionally strong, surpassing expectations with an 8% year-over-year revenue increase and 9% sequential growth. The company's positive guidance for Q3 with revenue growth forecasted at 23% to 26% year-over-year suggests strong short-term confidence. Coupled with strategic moves into new market adjacencies and improved customer relationships, these metrics point to a sustained recovery and growth momentum, likely boosting investor optimism.
