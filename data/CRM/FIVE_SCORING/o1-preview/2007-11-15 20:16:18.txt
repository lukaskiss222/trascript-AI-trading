Salesforce reported exceptional third-quarter results, achieving record revenue and operating cash flow, and significantly increasing GAAP profits. Major customer wins, including a landmark deal with Citigroup and expanded deployments with Japan Post and Dell, demonstrate strong market adoption and momentum. With raised guidance, positive management tone, and robust international growth, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
