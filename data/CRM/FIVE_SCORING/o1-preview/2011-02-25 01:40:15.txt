Salesforce reported robust Q4 results with revenue increasing 29% year-over-year to $457 million and a record operating cash flow of approximately $170 million. The company raised its revenue guidance for fiscal year 2012 to $2.03 billionâ€“$2.05 billion, signaling strong confidence in continued growth driven by increased adoption of its multi-cloud offerings and strategic acquisitions like Heroku and Dimdim. This positive financial performance and optimistic outlook are likely to generate a great positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
