Salesforce.com delivered strong Q2 results, exceeding revenue and EPS expectations with a 64% year-over-year revenue growth and raising full-year guidance. Management's optimistic tone, highlighted by significant customer wins, new product launches, and the decision of CFO Steve Cakebread to remain with the company, indicates confidence in continued growth. These factors are likely to positively influence investor sentiment and drive the stock price higher in the short term.
