Salesforce reported exceptional Q3 results, with revenue surpassing expectations at $130 million (up 57% year-over-year) and record subscriber additions. Significant customer expansions, notably Cisco doubling its subscriptions to become their largest customer, and new partnerships with IBM and Deloitte indicate strong growth momentum. With raised revenue guidance and continued innovation in their platform offerings, the stock is likely to rally in the short term.
