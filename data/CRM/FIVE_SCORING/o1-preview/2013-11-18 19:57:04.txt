Salesforce reported exceptional Q3 results, surpassing $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, with a 36% year-over-year increase, and raised its full-year revenue guidance. The upbeat management tone, the launch of the Salesforce1 platform, and strong customer wins like HP and Roche indicate robust short-term momentum. These factors are likely to lead to a positive rally in the stock price over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
