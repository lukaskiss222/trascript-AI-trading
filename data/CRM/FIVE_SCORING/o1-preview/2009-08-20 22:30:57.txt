Salesforce.com reported strong Q2 results with 20% revenue growth and over 110% increase in GAAP EPS year-over-year, surpassing expectations. The company slightly raised its full-year revenue and EPS guidance, reflecting confidence in continued growth despite a challenging IT spending environment. Positive management tone, key customer wins, and robust performance in new business areas suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
