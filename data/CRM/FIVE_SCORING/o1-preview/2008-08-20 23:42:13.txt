Salesforce reported strong Q2 results, including a 49% increase in revenue and surpassing the $1 billion annual revenue run-rate milestone.

Despite some concerns about deferred revenue growth, the company's robust performance and optimistic outlook are likely to have a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
