Salesforce.com's Q1 results exceeded expectations, with revenue growing 52% year-over-year to $247.6 million, and GAAP operating margin expanding to 6.2%. The company's strong performance was driven by its leadership in the software-as-a-service market, as well as the growing adoption of its platform-as-a-service offerings. With a strong balance sheet and improving profitability, Salesforce.com is well-positioned for continued growth and expansion. The company's guidance for Q2 and the full year also suggests a positive outlook, with revenue expected to reach $1.060 billion to $1.065 billion for the year.
