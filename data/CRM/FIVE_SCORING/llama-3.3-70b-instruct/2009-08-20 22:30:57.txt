Salesforce's Q2 results exceeded expectations, with revenue growing 20% year-over-year to $316 million and GAAP earnings per share increasing by over 110% to $0.17. The company's customer base expanded by approximately 3,900 net new paying customers, bringing the total to over 63,000, representing a 32% year-over-year increase. Salesforce also reported strong growth in its Service Cloud and Custom Cloud businesses, with new business signings from these segments accounting for over 25% of total new business in the quarter. Given the solid financial performance and the company's continued innovation and customer acquisition, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive.
