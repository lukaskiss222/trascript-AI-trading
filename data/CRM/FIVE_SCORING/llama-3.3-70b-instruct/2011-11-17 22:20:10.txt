The earnings transcript of Salesforce, Inc. indicates a strong performance, with revenue growth of 36% and non-GAAP EPS above guidance. The company's social enterprise strategy is gaining traction, with significant deals closed in the quarter, including Verizon and Electronic Arts. However, the growth in deferred revenue was slightly lower than expected, which may raise concerns about near-term billings. Overall, the company's guidance for the next fiscal year is optimistic, with revenue expected to reach $2.88 billion to $2.92 billion.

The key points from the transcript are: 
1) Salesforce.com delivered strong Q3 results with revenue growth of 36% and non-GAAP EPS above guidance. 
2) The company's social enterprise strategy is driving growth, with significant deals closed in the quarter, including Verizon and Electronic Arts. 
3) Deferred revenue growth was slightly lower than expected, which may raise concerns about near-term billings. 
4) The company's guidance for the next fiscal year is optimistic, with revenue expected to reach $2.88 billion to $2.92 billion.

Considering these points, I believe the stock will have a positive impact in the short term due to the strong revenue growth and optimistic guidance for the next fiscal year.
