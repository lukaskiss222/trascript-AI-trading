Salesforce.com's Q4 earnings call revealed a strong finish to fiscal 2009, with revenue and GAAP earnings exceeding expectations. The company's cloud computing business model is well-positioned to thrive in a challenging economic environment, with customers seeking predictable and scalable subscription costs. Despite some concerns about attrition and macroeconomic uncertainty, the company's guidance for fiscal 2010 is solid, with projected revenue growth of 21-24% and operating margin expansion of 250 basis points. The growth of Force.com, with over 100,000 custom applications built on the platform, is a promising development, and the company's expanding customer base, including large enterprises like EMC and Avon, bodes well for future growth. Overall, the call suggests a positive short-term outlook for the stock.
