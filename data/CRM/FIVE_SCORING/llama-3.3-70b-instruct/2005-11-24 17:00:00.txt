Salesforce's Q3 earnings call revealed strong revenue growth, subscriber additions, and a solid financial performance. The company's investments in people, technology, and events are expected to drive future growth, and the introduction of the AppExchange platform is a significant milestone. Despite some minor pressure on gross margins, the company's operating margins improved, and the tax adjustment added to the reported EPS. The guidance for Q4 and FY '07 is optimistic, with expected revenue growth and improving gross margins.
