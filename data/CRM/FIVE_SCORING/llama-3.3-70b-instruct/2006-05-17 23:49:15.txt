Salesforce's Q1 results exceeded expectations, with revenue of $104.7 million, up 63% year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.04. The company's customer base expanded to 22,700 customers, with 444,000 subscribers, representing a 45,000 subscriber increase from the previous quarter. Management expressed optimism about the growth of AppExchange, with over 214 applications available and 8,600 installations to date. The company raised its full-year revenue guidance to $478-483 million, with non-GAAP EPS expected to be $0.17-0.19.

The company's strong performance, combined with its expanding customer base and growth of AppExchange, suggests a positive outlook for the stock. The raised guidance and strong demand for the company's products and services, particularly Unlimited Edition, contribute to this optimism.
