Salesforce's Q3 earnings call revealed strong top-line growth, with revenue increasing 35% year-over-year to $788 million, and a robust pipeline positioning the company for a strong finish to the year. The company's non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 10%, and it expects fiscal year 2013 revenue growth of approximately 34%. Salesforce's growth is driven by its leadership in sales, service, and platform, with a strong demand for its solutions across customers of all sizes and geographies. The company's strategic acquisitions, such as Buddy Media, and its focus on innovation, including the development of its Marketing Cloud, are expected to drive future growth.
