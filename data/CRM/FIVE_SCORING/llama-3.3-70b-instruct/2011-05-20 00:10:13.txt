The transcript of Salesforce's Q1 fiscal 2022 results indicates a strong quarter with revenue growth of 34% year-over-year, driven by the company's strategic decision to bring social, mobile, and open cloud technologies to the enterprise. The company's flagship Sales Cloud continued to perform well, with significant wins against Microsoft, and the Service Cloud saw strong customer adoption. The Force.com platform also showed growth, with over 130,000 developers creating applications on the platform. Given the strong quarterly performance and the raised revenue guidance for fiscal 2022, I expect the stock to experience a positive impact in the short term.
