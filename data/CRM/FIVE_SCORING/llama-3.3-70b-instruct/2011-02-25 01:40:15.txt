Salesforce's strong Q4 earnings, with revenue up 29% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS of $0.31, beat expectations and demonstrate the company's continued momentum. The company's multi-product strategy, with growth across all four core product lines (Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Platform, and Collaboration Cloud), and its focus on social, mobile, and open technologies, position it well for long-term success. Guidance for FY12, with revenue expected to reach $2.03-2.05 billion, suggests continued growth, although at a slightly slower pace.
