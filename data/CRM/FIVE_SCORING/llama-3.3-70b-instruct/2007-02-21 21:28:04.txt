Salesforce's Q4 earnings call revealed strong revenue growth, with a 58% year-over-year increase, and significant customer and subscriber additions. The company's guidance for fiscal year 2008 also indicates continued growth, with revenue projected to be between $710 million and $720 million. Despite the positive outlook, the stock may face short-term pressure due to concerns about profitability and the impact of increased hiring on operating margins. However, the company's long-term prospects remain strong, driven by its leadership position in the on-demand computing market and the growing demand for software-as-a-service solutions.
