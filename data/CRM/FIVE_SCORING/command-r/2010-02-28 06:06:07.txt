Salesforce continued to perform strongly amidst challenging market conditions, with Q4 results surpassing expectations. Notably, the Service Cloud and Custom Cloud platforms reported record growth, diversifying the company's revenue streams. The upcoming launch of Chatter, an enterprise collaboration application, further expands Salesforce's market opportunities. However, aggressive investment plans for FY2011, focused on global distribution and sales expansion, will impact short-term margin expansion and cash flow. The stock may experience some pressure in the next weeks as investors digest the implications of these investments. [0]
