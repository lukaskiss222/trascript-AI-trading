The earnings call reveals Salesforce’s continued rapid growth, with Q2 revenue up 31%. The company’s expansion plans, increased investment in R&D, and recent ExactTarget acquisition bode well for the future. The market appears to have reacted positively to these aggressive growth strategies. 

However, the stock may face near-term pressure due to lower margins from acquisitions and increased operating expenses. Management’s focus on optimizing these acquisitions' synergies could dependably influence the stock’s performance in the next few weeks.
