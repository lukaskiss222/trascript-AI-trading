Based on the earnings transcript, Salesforce's fourth quarter and full-year results were strong, with revenue growth and cash flow exceeding expectations. The company's social enterprise strategy has differentiated it in the market, driving its ability to become a more strategic partner to its customers. The company's pipeline is robust, and it expects continued growth in 2013. However, the company's guidance for 2013 is slightly below expectations, and there are some concerns about the competitive landscape and the potential for margin compression. Overall, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
