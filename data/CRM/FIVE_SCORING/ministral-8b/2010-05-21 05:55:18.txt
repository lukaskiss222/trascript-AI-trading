**Analysis:**

- **Strong Q1 Performance:** Salesforce reported a record $377 million in Q1 revenue, up 24% year-over-year, and a non-GAAP EPS of $0.30, up from $0.28 a year ago. This demonstrates strong demand for cloud computing services.
- **Customer Growth:** The company added 4,800 net new customers, bringing the total to 77,000, an increase of 30% year-over-year.
- **New Products and Services:** Salesforce introduced Salesforce Chatter, Salesforce Jigsaw, and VMforce, all of which are expected to drive significant growth.
- **Currency Impact:** The strengthening euro is expected to reduce revenue by $20 million over the next three quarters.
- **Acquisitions:** Salesforce acquired Jigsaw and two small technology companies, which are expected to add $14 million in GAAP revenue and $38 million in non-GAAP expenses for the remainder of fiscal 2011.
- **Outlook:** The company raised its full-year revenue guidance to $1.54 billion to $1.555 billion and its non-GAAP EPS outlook to $1.13 to $1.15.

**Conclusion:**

The strong Q1 performance, customer growth, and new product introductions suggest that Salesforce is well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory. However, the currency impact and the dilution from acquisitions may temper the stock's performance in the near term. Given the strong fundamentals and the company's focus on growth, I predict a positive impact on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks.

**Rating:** 1
