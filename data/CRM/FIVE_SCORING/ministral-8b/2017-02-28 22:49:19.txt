Based on the earnings transcript, Salesforce delivered a strong fiscal year 2017, with revenue up 26% and operating cash flow up 29%. The company's strong performance is driven by its CRM market leadership, strategic acquisitions, and innovative products like Einstein and Salesforce1. The company is well-positioned for future growth, with a strong pipeline and increasing customer adoption. The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the company's strong performance and positive outlook. However, the stock may face some pressure in the near term due to the sequential drop in deferred revenue and the potential impact of FX headwinds.
