**Analysis:**

Salesforce's Q4 and full-year results were solid, with revenue growth of 29% in constant currency and strong guidance for 2021. The company's strategic acquisitions of Tableau and Vlocity, along with its continued focus on vertical solutions, indicate a strong commitment to growth and innovation. The departure of Co-CEO Keith Block is a significant change, but the company has a strong leadership team to take his place. The company's strong financial performance, coupled with its focus on sustainability and social impact, positions it well for continued growth. However, the ongoing uncertainty around the Coronavirus pandemic could pose a risk to revenue in the near term.

**Conclusion:**

Given the strong financial performance, strategic acquisitions, and continued focus on innovation, I expect Salesforce's stock to perform well in the short term. The company's commitment to sustainability and social impact also makes it an attractive investment. However, the ongoing uncertainty around the Coronavirus pandemic could pose a risk to revenue in the near term. Overall, I expect Salesforce's stock to perform well in the next 1-2 weeks.
