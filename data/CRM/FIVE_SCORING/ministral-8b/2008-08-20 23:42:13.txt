Based on the transcript, Salesforce's Q2 2009 earnings call revealed robust financial performance and growth, with key highlights including:

- **Revenue Growth**: Salesforce achieved a 49% year-over-year increase in revenue to $263 million.
- **Customer Success**: The company added a record 4,100 net new customers, bringing the total to 47,700.
- **Strategic Acquisitions**: Salesforce announced the acquisition of InStranet, which will enhance its customer service and support capabilities.
- **Platform Expansion**: The company is expanding its force.com platform as a service, which is gaining traction among developers and ISVs.

Despite these positive developments, analysts and investors should consider the following factors:

- **Deferred Revenue**: Salesforce's deferred revenue grew by $9 million, which is slightly lower than expected. The company attributes this to the timing of large deals and the impact of the strong fourth quarter in 2008.
- **Acquisition Impact**: The InStranet acquisition will have a near-term impact on GAAP earnings and cash flow, but the company expects it to be EPS neutral in fiscal 2010.
- **Currency Headwinds**: The strengthening of the U.S. dollar may impact revenue and profit growth in the second half of the year.

Overall, the earnings call highlights Salesforce's strong growth and customer success, but there are some short-term concerns to consider. Given these factors, the stock is likely to face some short-term volatility in the coming weeks.
