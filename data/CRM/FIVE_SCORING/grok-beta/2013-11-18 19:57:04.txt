Salesforce exhibited strong performance in Q3 2014, with notable revenue growth, significant expansion in deferred revenue, and operational success, especially with the integration of ExactTarget. The stock is likely to see positive reactions due to the upward revision of full-year revenue estimates and a strong fiscal 2015 outlook. Despite operational challenges tied to acquisitions, the overall market reception and the anticipation around Dreamforce could drive investor confidence in the short term.
