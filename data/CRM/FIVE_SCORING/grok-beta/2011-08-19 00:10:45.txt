Salesforceâ€™s fiscal Q2 results were remarkably strong, with revenue growing 38% and adding a record 6,300 net new customers, surpassing the 100,000-customer milestone. Expansion into the social enterprise and cloud computing arenas, alongside strategic acquisitions like Radian6, are fuelling high expectations for continued growth. However, increased spending on hiring, product development, and events are reducing short-term profit margins, which might pressure the stock price in the near-term even though there is strong demand for Salesforce's offerings.
