Salesforce Inc.â€™s Q4 of fiscal year 2011 displayed strong financial performance with significant revenue growth, net addition of customers, and notable cash flow improvements. However, tempered forward guidance for fiscal year 2012, coupled with aggressive spending on sales and marketing, and increased future costs due to acquisitions, suggests aggressive investment in future growth rather than a guarantee of sustained short-term upward momentum. The stock might face slight pressure in the immediate term due to expenses related to the aforementioned investments.
