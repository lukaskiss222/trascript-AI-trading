Salesforce's Q1 FY13 earnings exceeded expectations, with revenue up 38% year-over-year and strong operating margins. The company increased its full-year revenue guidance to $3 billion, reflecting confidence in the demand for its cloud solutions. Despite market concerns, Salesforce's strong pipeline and growth in both enterprise and SMB sectors suggest short-term positive momentum for the stock, buoyed by its ongoing strategic transformation into a social enterprise platform.
