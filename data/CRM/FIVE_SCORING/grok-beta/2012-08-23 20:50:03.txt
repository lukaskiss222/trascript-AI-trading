Salesforce’s Q2 2013 earnings call indicates strong financial performance with revenue growth and cash flow significantly above expectations. Key positive elements include strong guidance for the next quarter, dominance in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for multiple products, and anticipation for major customer events like Dreamforce. However, a soft spot in very small businesses in the U.S. due to economic factors suggests some potential market resistance. Overall, the call’s positive tone and raised revenue guidance suggest short-term investor confidence, likely leading to a positive stock movement.
