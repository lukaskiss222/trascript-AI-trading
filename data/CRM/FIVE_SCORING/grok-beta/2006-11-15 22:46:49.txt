Salesforce, Inc., reported a robust fiscal third quarter, nearly reaching a $0.5 billion annual revenue run-rate, signaling strong customer growth and potential future expansion. The introduction of the Apex language and platform opens up new avenues for growth through application development, potentially attracting more ISVs and large enterprises. However, the significant increase in stock-based compensation expenses might foreshadow a higher share count soon, potentially diluting EPS, despite expected revenue growth into FY 2008. The stock is likely to react positively due to solid quarterly performance and future revenue expectations, but concerns about margin pressures from stock compensation expenses could temper this enthusiasm.
