The Q3 results call highlighted Salesforce's robust growth with a 43% year-over-year revenue increase to $276 million, reaching an annual run rate of over $1.1 billion, and exceeding expectations in earnings per share.

These factors, along with the broader economic environment, suggest there might be short-term pressure on the stock price as the company faces headwinds from macroeconomic conditions and currency volatility.
