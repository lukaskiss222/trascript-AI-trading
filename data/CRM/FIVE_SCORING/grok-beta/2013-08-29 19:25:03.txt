Salesforce reported strong Q2 earnings with revenue surpassing expectations, which typically would have a positive short-term stock price impact. However, the lowered operating margin, increased CapEx, and the complexity introduced by ExactTarget's integration might cause investor concerns regarding profitability. The bullish guidance for a $1 billion quarter and raised full-year revenue expectations are positive signals, but the stock's response over the next 1-2 weeks could be muted due to the acquisition's impact on margins and future uncertainty.
