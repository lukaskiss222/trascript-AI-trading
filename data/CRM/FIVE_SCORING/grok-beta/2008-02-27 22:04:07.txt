Salesforce's Q4 earnings call reflected strong growth with revenue increasing 50% year-over-year to $216.9 million, and guidance for fiscal year '09 projecting over $1 billion in revenue. The company's expansion in the AppExchange ecosystem, robust developer community, and anticipated operating margin improvements suggest positive market perception. However, the lack of detailed commentary on sales capacity or pipeline management and the mention of an unchanged business model despite significant growth add some uncertainty. Given the company's past performance, the management's confidence in future growth, and the sector's positive reception to SaaS, Salesforce's stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
