The Q3 2013 earnings call for Salesforce, Inc., showcased positive developments. The company reported a significant revenue increase, growth in deferred revenue, and optimism about future performance with a projected fiscal 2014 revenue estimate range that implies continued strong growth. However, the mention of macroeconomic factors such as the fiscal cliff introduces some uncertainty. Management's bullish guidance for the upcoming fiscal year and the lack of immediate impact from global issues suggest that the stock might experience a positive but tempered reaction in the short term.
