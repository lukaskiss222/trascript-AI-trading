Salesforce reported a strong second-quarter, exceeding expectations with revenue up 64% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS above the high end of their outlook. High subscriber growth, positive movement towards their $1B revenue goal, and the introduction of multiple new service editions suggest positive momentum. However, the stock might see a slight negative impact due to the potential dilution from the revised higher average share count for the full fiscal year and the raised guidance expectations now baked into the stock price.
