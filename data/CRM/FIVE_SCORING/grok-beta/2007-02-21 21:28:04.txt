The Q4 earnings call for Salesforce.com showed remarkable progress with a significant subscriber growth to 250,000, a record Q4 revenue of $144 million, and confidence in future growth through on-demand computing trends. The company's move towards twice-annual subscriber reporting and focus on high revenue large deals can create stock price volatility, though the companyâ€™s outlook and growth figures suggest underlying business strength. However, concerns remain about the heavy spending and a return to GAAP reporting that includes substantial stock-based compensation expenses, which could pressure short-term earnings.
