Salesforce's Q1 fiscal year 2012 results showed strong momentum with revenue growth accelerating beyond expectations. The company exceeded its revenue forecast and demonstrated global growth across all markets, with significant investments in distribution, product development, and brand-building initiatives. Management's optimism is reflected in raised revenue guidance, despite potential headwinds in Japan. However, the acquisition cost and lower operating margins might weigh on stock performance in the short-term, alongside the inherent uncertainty around global economic recovery. Considering the strong customer growth, the strategic positioning in cloud computing, and the positive outlook, the stock might experience a mild positive impact in the next 1-2 weeks.
