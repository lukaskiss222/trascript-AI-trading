Salesforce's Q3 2006 earnings call highlights strong subscriber growth, driven by expansion within existing accounts, significant enterprise wins (Symantec, ADP), and continued SMB success.  Management's optimistic tone, the launch of the AppExchange platform, and impressive transaction volume suggest a positive outlook for the stock.  The company's substantial investment in infrastructure (Mirrorforce) to maintain service reliability while continuing to hire personnel suggests a commitment to maintaining market leadership, which should bode well for short-term stock performance.
