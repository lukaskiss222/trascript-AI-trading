Salesforce's Q1 2007 earnings call highlights strong revenue growth (63% YoY), exceeding guidance and demonstrating significant customer adoption, particularly within financial services and expanding to large enterprises like Cisco.  Management's upbeat tone, coupled with increased guidance and a focus on the AppExchange platform's expansion, suggests a positive outlook for the stock over the next 1-2 weeks.  The company's success in attracting and retaining customers is likely to drive further investment and appreciation in the short term.
