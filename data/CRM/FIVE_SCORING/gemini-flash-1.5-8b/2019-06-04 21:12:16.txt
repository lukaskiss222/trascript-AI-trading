Salesforce's Q1 2020 earnings call highlighted strong revenue growth (26% constant currency) and robust operating cash flow, exceeding prior year results.  Management emphasized the continued importance of digital transformation and the company's position as a leader in providing comprehensive customer 360 solutions.  Positive guidance updates and the continuing strength of the Salesforce platform, particularly with MuleSoft, suggest a continuation of strong growth in the short to medium term.
