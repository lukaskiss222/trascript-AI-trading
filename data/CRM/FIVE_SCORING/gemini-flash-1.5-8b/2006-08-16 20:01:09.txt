Salesforce's Q2 earnings call highlighted significant revenue growth (64% YoY) and strong subscriber additions (57,000 net new).  Management's emphasis on the AppExchange platform and broader product offerings, especially the Unlimited Edition, suggests a shift away from solely focusing on subscriber growth towards product diversification and a larger addressable market.  This positive outlook, combined with the CEO's confidence in the company's future and continued growth trajectory, suggests a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
