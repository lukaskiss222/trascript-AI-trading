Salesforce's Q3 earnings call highlights strong revenue growth (43% YoY) and a robust customer base expansion (4,100 new customers).  Management confidently projects continued growth in FY2010, driven by the company's cloud-first value proposition, but notes cautiousness given the economic environment.  The call indicates a likely positive short-term impact for the stock due to strong performance despite macro headwinds.
