Salesforce's Q3 earnings call highlights strong revenue growth exceeding expectations, driven by a successful social enterprise strategy and large deal closures.  Management's upbeat tone and guidance for continued growth, including reaching a $3 billion annual revenue run rate, suggest a positive outlook for the stock.  Factors like the acquisitions and successful implementation within existing customer bases and potential for further integrations of social enterprise solutions might give rise to further increases in demand for Salesforce services.
