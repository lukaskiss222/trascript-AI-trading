Salesforce's Q3 earnings call highlighted strong revenue growth exceeding expectations, driven by improved new business and reduced attrition.  Management expressed optimism about a growth stance, pointing to record customer additions and key wins against competitors like Oracle and Microsoft.  The guidance for Q4 and FY2011, while conservative, suggests an ongoing focus on profitability alongside growth.  The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short-term (1-2 weeks) due to the positive news and optimistic outlook.
