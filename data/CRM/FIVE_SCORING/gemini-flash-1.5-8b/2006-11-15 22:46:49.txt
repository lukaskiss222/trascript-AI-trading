Salesforce's Q3 earnings call highlighted strong growth and positive momentum.  Record revenue, exceeding expectations, coupled with significant subscriber additions and key partnerships (especially with Cisco) point to a positive short-term outlook.  Management's focus on product innovation (Apex and AppExchange) and strategic partnerships further suggest continued strong growth and investor confidence.
