Salesforce's Q4 2015 earnings call highlighted strong growth, exceeding guidance on revenue, margins, and cash flow, driven by increased adoption of the customer success platform across various industries.  CEO Benioff emphasized the platform's expanding ecosystem and strategic importance to customers.  The company's focus on analytics, partnerships with large systems integrators, and impressive deals—like ABB's, Time Warner's, and Merck's—suggest a continued upward trajectory supported by increasingly strategic customer relationships.
