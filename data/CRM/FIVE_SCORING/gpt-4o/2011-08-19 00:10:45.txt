Salesforce delivered strong quarterly results, exceeding expectations with a 38% revenue increase to $546 million and a rise in deferred revenue. The company continues to expand aggressively, adding 6,300 new customers and raising full-year revenue guidance, which indicates robust demand for its cloud services. Management's upbeat tone and strategic focus on hiring, acquisitions, and the social enterprise market highlight confidence in sustained growth. This positive momentum is likely to support short-term stock appreciation.
