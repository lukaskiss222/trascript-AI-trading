Salesforce has reported strong performance with a 31% year-over-year revenue increase and raised full-year guidance, demonstrating robust growth, especially in the Americas and Europe. The acquisition of ExactTarget is showing positive early financial contributions, although it initially impacts margins due to integration costs. Management's optimistic tone and strategic expansions with partners like Sysco and Louis Vuitton bodes well for the stock, supported by a solid pipeline of future opportunities and transformative acquisitions.
