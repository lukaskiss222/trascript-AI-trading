Salesforce presented a highly positive Q3 2014 earnings report, demonstrating strong growth with revenue increasing 36% year-over-year and announcing a strategic partnership with Hewlett Packard. The launch of Salesforce1, aimed at enhancing mobile and cloud capabilities, further positions the company as a leader in cloud-based CRM solutions. With increased revenue guidance for fiscal year 2015 and a positive reception of their ExactTarget acquisition, the company is well-positioned for continued short-term growth, indicating a potential positive impact on its stock price in the coming weeks.
