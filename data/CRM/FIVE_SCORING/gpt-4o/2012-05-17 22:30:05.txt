Salesforce reported strong quarterly results with a 38% increase in revenue and a 50% increase in operating cash flow, reflecting robust demand and execution. The positive momentum allowed for an upward revision of full-year revenue guidance, indicating continued confidence in growth across cloud, social, and mobile technologies. Despite external market uncertainties, Salesforce's leadership in CRM and cloud solutions, along with its expanding customer base and backlog, suggest a likely rally in the stock over the short term.
