Salesforce's Q2 2009 earnings call presents a picture of robust growth and strong financial performance, with revenue increasing by 49% year-over-year and achieving an annual revenue run-rate exceeding $1 billion. The company's strategic expansion into platforms as a service (PaaS), solid customer additions, including significant deals like the one with Dell, and a positive outlook affirm confidence in its growth trajectory. However, management acknowledges some short-term impacts, such as currency fluctuations and acquisition-related costs. Overall, the tone is optimistic, suggesting a positive short-term impact on the stock.
