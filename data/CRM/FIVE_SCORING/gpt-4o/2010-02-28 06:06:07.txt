Salesforce reported an impressive quarter with significant revenue growth of 22% year-over-year and record operating cash flow. The company's aggressive hiring plans and optimism about its new product, Chatter, suggest a focus on future growth. Despite the margin pressure from increased investment in sales and marketing, Salesforce has raised its revenue guidance for the next fiscal year. The strong performance against competitors and the expansion in non-sales cloud services indicate positive momentum. In the short term, the stock is likely to respond positively to these results due to the company's clear growth trajectory and increased market confidence.
