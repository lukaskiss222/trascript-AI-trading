Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Salesforce's stock price. Key factors include:

1. Strong Q3 performance with revenue up 20% YoY and doubled earnings growth
2. Record new customer additions (4,700) and improving attrition rates
3. Evidence of demand recovery and return to growth stance with increased hiring
4. Major product announcements coming at Dreamforce conference
5. Raised full-year guidance and preliminary positive outlook for FY2011

While management was somewhat conservative on long-term margin expansion, the near-term momentum and positive business indicators suggest the stock should see upward movement over the next 1-2 weeks.
