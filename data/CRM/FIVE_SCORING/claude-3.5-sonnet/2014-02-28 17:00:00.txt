Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Salesforce's stock price. Key bullish factors include:

1. Strong Q4 results with revenue up 37% YoY to $1.15B and raised full-year guidance by $100M
2. Record low customer attrition rates indicating strong product stickiness
3. Robust enterprise deal activity with over 200 seven/eight-figure transactions in Q4
4. Successful integration of ExactTarget acquisition contributing $96M in revenue
5. Management's confident tone about Salesforce1 platform adoption and competitive positioning

While CFO Graham Smith announced his retirement, the 13-month transition period should minimize any negative impact. The company's strong execution, accelerating growth, and expanding product portfolio outweigh this change.
