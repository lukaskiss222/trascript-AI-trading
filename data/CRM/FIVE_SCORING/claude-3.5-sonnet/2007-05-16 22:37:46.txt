Based on the earnings transcript, here's my analysis:

The key positives:
- Strong revenue growth of 55% YoY to $162.4M, exceeding guidance
- Operating cash flow doubled YoY to $37M 
- Added 2,500 new customers including major wins like Japan Post
- International expansion gaining momentum, especially in Japan
- Strong product innovation pipeline and platform strategy

Minor concerns:
- High operating expenses at 76% of revenue
- High effective tax rate of 73%
- Capital expenditures increased significantly to $16M
- Some one-time charges related to acquisitions and office expansions

Overall, this was a very strong quarter with accelerating growth, major customer wins, and raised full-year guidance. The company's competitive position appears to be strengthening, especially in key international markets. The strong cash flow generation and customer additions indicate sustainable momentum.
