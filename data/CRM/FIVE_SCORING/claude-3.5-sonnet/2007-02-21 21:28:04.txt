Based on the earnings transcript, I would give Salesforce.com a strongly positive rating for the following key reasons:

1. Exceptional growth metrics across the board: 58% revenue growth, record customer and subscriber additions (90k new subscribers), and strong international expansion (84% growth in Asia-Pacific).

2. Very positive commentary from management about market opportunity and competitive positioning, with major enterprise wins from competitors (Cisco, Dell deals of 15k+ seats each).

3. Strong underlying business fundamentals with <1% monthly churn, healthy cash generation ($38M in Q4), and growing deferred revenue ($284M, up 58% YoY).

4. Clear strategic vision around platform strategy (Apex, AppExchange) that positions them well for continued growth and market leadership in the rapidly expanding SaaS market.

While there are some minor concerns around increased spending and ASP pressure from large deals, the overall picture shows a company executing extremely well and positioned for continued strong growth.
