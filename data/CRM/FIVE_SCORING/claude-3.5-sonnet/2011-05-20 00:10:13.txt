Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Salesforce's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key factors supporting this view:

1. Strong financial performance with accelerating revenue growth (34% YoY) and reaching $2B annual run rate milestone. Deferred revenue grew 38% YoY, indicating strong future business momentum.

2. Management raised full-year revenue guidance and showed confidence in their growth trajectory and competitive position, particularly against Microsoft and Oracle.

3. Positive enterprise buying environment noted by CEO Benioff, with customers looking to make strategic cloud transformations and Salesforce seeing larger 8-digit deals.

The only minor concerns were continued investments impacting margins and some uncertainty around Japan post-earthquake, but these appear well understood by the market and outweighed by the strong growth indicators.
