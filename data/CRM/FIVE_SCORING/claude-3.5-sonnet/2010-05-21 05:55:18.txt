Based on this earnings call transcript, I would give a strong positive rating for the following reasons:

Salesforce demonstrated excellent momentum with record new customer additions (4,800), strong revenue growth (24% YoY), and exceptional cash flow generation ($143M). Management expressed high confidence in multiple growth drivers including:

1. Core Sales/Service Cloud momentum with triple-digit growth in Service Cloud
2. Transformative potential of new Chatter collaboration product with strong early customer reception
3. Strategic acquisitions (Jigsaw, VMforce partnership) expanding addressable markets

The company raised full year guidance despite FX headwinds, and management's tone was notably optimistic about enterprise spending environment and competitive position.
