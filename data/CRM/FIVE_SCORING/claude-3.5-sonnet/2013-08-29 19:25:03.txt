Based on the earnings call transcript, I am highly positive about Salesforce's near-term stock prospects. Here are the key points supporting this view:

1. Exceptional Financial Performance:
- Revenue grew 31% YoY to $957M, exceeding guidance
- Operating cash flow up 34% to $183M 
- Deferred revenue up 34% to $1.79B
- Company raised full year guidance

2. Strategic Developments:
- Successfully closed ExactTarget acquisition
- Added key executive talent (Keith Block from Oracle)
- Strong enterprise customer wins (Sysco, Louis Vuitton, etc.)
- Growing market leadership across core products

3. Forward-Looking Indicators:
- Management extremely confident in outlook
- Pipeline appears strong
- Upcoming product releases and major customer events
- Integration synergies from ExactTarget beginning to materialize

The combination of strong current performance, strategic positioning, and positive forward indicators suggests the stock should see significant positive momentum over the next 1-2 weeks.
