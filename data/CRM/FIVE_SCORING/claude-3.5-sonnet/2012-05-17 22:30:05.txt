Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of the likely 1-2 week stock impact:

Key Positives:
- Strong Q1 results with revenue up 38% to $695M
- Raised full year guidance by $50M to $3B
- Record Q1 operating cash flow of $210M, up 53%
- Deferred revenue + backlog now exceeds $4B
- Strong enterprise momentum with large deals and renewals
- Continued decline in customer attrition rates
- Healthy pipeline growth across regions

Key Concerns:
- Deferred revenue growth expected to slow sequentially
- Some impact from longer invoicing terms creating headwinds
- High expectations built into valuation

Overall, this was a very strong quarter that exceeded expectations across key metrics. Management's confident tone and raised guidance suggests continued momentum. While there are some moving parts around deferred revenue, the core business fundamentals remain robust. Given the strong results and outlook, the stock is likely to react positively in the near-term.
