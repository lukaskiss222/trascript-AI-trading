Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a strong positive impact on Salesforce's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key bullish factors include:

1. Exceptional Q4 results significantly beating expectations, with revenue up 50% YoY and operating margins expanding 600bps
2. Strong guidance for FY09 including first $1B+ revenue year and 300bps expected margin improvement
3. Record customer wins and expansions, including major enterprise deals vs Oracle/Microsoft
4. Robust cash flow generation, with operating cash flow up 112% YoY
5. Management's confident tone and lack of any concerns about macro environment impacting demand

The combination of strong current execution, raised guidance, and expanding profitability while maintaining high growth suggests the stock should react quite positively in the near-term.
