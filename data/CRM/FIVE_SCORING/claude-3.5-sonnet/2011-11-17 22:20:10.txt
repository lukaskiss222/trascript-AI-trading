Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Salesforce's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. The company showed strong performance with 36% revenue growth, raised guidance for both Q4 and FY2023, and demonstrated momentum in their social enterprise strategy with major customer wins (Verizon, EA, GE). While there were some concerns about deferred revenue growth, management provided clear explanations and emphasized strong underlying business metrics, including record new customer additions and robust pipelines. The positive commentary on demand across regions and emphatic confidence from CEO Marc Benioff about growth prospects should outweigh the deferred revenue concerns.
