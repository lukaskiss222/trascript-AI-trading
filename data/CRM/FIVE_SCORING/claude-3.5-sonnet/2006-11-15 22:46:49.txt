Based on this earnings transcript, I project a strong positive impact on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks for several key reasons:

1. The company significantly beat expectations with revenue of $130M (57% YoY growth) and reported their "most spectacular quarter ever" according to the CEO. They raised full year guidance and provided strong initial FY08 outlook of $700-710M.

2. Subscriber growth was exceptional at 61,000 net new adds - their highest ever. Major customer wins like Cisco expanding to 15,000 seats demonstrate strong enterprise adoption.

3. Management's tone was extremely confident throughout, highlighting success across all segments, strong competitive positioning versus SAP/Microsoft, and momentum with strategic partnerships (IBM, Deloitte).

4. The price increase announcement for their Unlimited Edition (from $195 to $250) indicates pricing power and should drive higher ASPs.

The only minor concerns were higher stock comp expenses and subscriber count adjustments, but these are overshadowed by the strong fundamental performance and positive outlook.
