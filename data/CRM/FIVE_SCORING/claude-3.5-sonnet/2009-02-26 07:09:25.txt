Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of the likely short-term (1-2 weeks) stock impact:

Positive factors:
- Strong Q4 results exceeding guidance (revenue +34% YoY, EPS +83% YoY)
- Major competitive wins vs Oracle/SAP/Microsoft
- Healthy cash position ($883M, no debt)
- Still seeing pricing stability

Concerns:
- Conservative FY10 guidance below expectations (slower growth, flat cash flow)
- Slight uptick in customer attrition in Q4
- Lower operating margin expansion target for FY10 (250bps vs 300bps)
- Deferred revenue growth slowing
- Management acknowledges macro uncertainty impacting deals

Overall, while the core business remains solid, the combination of light forward guidance, slowing metrics, and commentary about macro pressures will likely result in modest negative pressure on the stock in the very near-term as investors digest the more cautious outlook.
