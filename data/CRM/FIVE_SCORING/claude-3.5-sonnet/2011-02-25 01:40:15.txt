Based on the earnings call transcript, Salesforce demonstrated exceptional performance with strong indicators across multiple fronts:

Key Positives:
- Record Q4 revenue of $457M, up 29% YoY
- Deferred revenue grew 33% YoY to $935M (strongest growth in 9 quarters)
- Off-balance sheet backlog up 50% YoY to $1.5B
- Strong customer adoption across all clouds/products
- 40% sales headcount growth
- Multiple large deals including biggest deal ever
- Raised FY12 guidance to $2.03-2.05B

However, there are some cautionary elements:
- Conservative guidance relative to momentum
- Operating margins expected to be under pressure from investments
- Cash flow growth projected to slow to low-mid teens
- Heavy Q4 hiring will take time to ramp productivity

Given the strong beat, record backlog growth, expanding product portfolio and sales capacity investments, the near-term stock impact should be very positive despite conservative guidance. The fundamentals point to continued momentum.
