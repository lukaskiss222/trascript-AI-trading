Based on the earnings call transcript, Salesforce.com demonstrated strong execution and momentum across all key metrics. Key positives include:

1. Record Q4 performance with revenue up 22% to $354M, exceeding expectations
2. Strong new customer additions and reduced attrition rates
3. Success across all product lines (Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Custom Cloud)
4. Healthy expansion in international markets
5. Management's confident tone and aggressive investment plans for FY2011
6. Strong balance sheet with $1.7B in cash

The only minor concern is slightly lower operating margin expansion guidance for FY2011 due to increased investments in sales/distribution, though this appears strategic rather than defensive.

Given the strong results, positive forward guidance, and management's aggressive growth plans from a position of strength, I expect the stock to react positively in the near-term.
