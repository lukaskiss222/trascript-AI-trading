Based on the earnings call transcript, I'm quite positive about Salesforce's short-term stock outlook for the following key reasons:

1. Strong execution despite economic uncertainty: 43% revenue growth, beat on both revenue and EPS, maintained high customer retention (<1% monthly churn), and added 4,100 new customers matching previous quarter's record.

2. Management confidence and visibility: Provided strong FY2010 guidance of 27% growth with high visibility due to recurring revenue model. Sequential growth in bookings through Q3 (October stronger than September).

3. Counter-cyclical value proposition: Management emphasized their low upfront cost, low-risk model becomes more attractive during economic uncertainty as companies look to reduce IT spending and risk.

The company demonstrated strong fundamentals, business momentum, and their model appears well-positioned for the current economic environment.
