Based on the earnings transcript, here's my analysis for Salesforce's likely 1-2 week stock impact:

Key Positives:
- Record Q1 revenue of $104.7M, up 63% YoY and 15% QoQ
- Added 45,000 net new subscribers (444k total)
- Record 2,200 new customer additions
- Strong adoption of new premium Unlimited Edition
- Healthy expansion within major accounts like Cisco (7,500 seats)

Key Concerns:
- Some analysts focused on subscriber growth deceleration
- Professional services margins remain negative
- High sales & marketing costs as % of revenue
- Still early days for AppExchange monetization

Overall Conclusion:
The strong revenue growth, customer additions, and expansion within key accounts should drive positive sentiment in the near-term. Management's confident tone and raised full-year guidance also supports an upward bias. While there are some concerns around subscriber metrics, the overall business momentum and execution appears solid.
