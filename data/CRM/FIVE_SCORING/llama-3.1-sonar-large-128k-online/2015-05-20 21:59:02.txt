For the recent earnings report of Salesforce, Inc. for Q1 FY2025, here are the key points and their implications for the short-term stock price:

## Revenue and Guidance
- Salesforce reported $9.13 billion in revenue, an 11% increase year-over-year, but slightly missed analyst estimates. The company also provided weaker-than-expected guidance for Q2 FY2025, which fell short of consensus projections[2][4][5].

## Financial Performance
- Despite the revenue miss, Salesforce delivered strong financial metrics, including a non-GAAP operating margin of 32.1%, up 450 basis points year-over-year, and significant increases in operating and free cash flow[1][3][4].

## Market Reaction
- The stock experienced a significant selloff following the earnings announcement, dropping by 20% and marking the worst day since 2004. This reaction was largely due to the weaker-than-expected Q2 guidance[2][4].

## Long-term Prospects
- The company remains bullish on its AI transformation and its position in the market, with CEO Marc Benioff highlighting the potential for AI to drive future growth. The integration of AI across Salesforce's clouds and the strong performance of its Data Cloud are seen as key drivers for long-term success[2][4][5].

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely negative due to the immediate market reaction to the missed revenue estimates and weaker Q2 guidance, despite the company's overall strong financial performance and positive long-term prospects.
