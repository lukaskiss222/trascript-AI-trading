The transcript for Salesforce's fourth quarter fiscal year 2007 financial results indicates several positive and strategic elements that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Revenue Growth**: Salesforce reported a 58% year-over-year increase in fourth quarter revenue and a 60% increase for the full fiscal year, demonstrating robust growth and market traction.
2. **Substantial Customer and Subscriber Growth**: The company added a record 90,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter and saw significant growth in large deployments, with notable customer wins such as Dell and Cisco.
3. **Expanding Product and Platform Capabilities**: Salesforce highlighted its innovative platform developments, including the AppExchange, Apex programming language, and new products like Sandbox and Unlimited Edition, which are expected to drive future growth.
4. **Positive Cash Flow and Balance Sheet**: The company reported strong cash from operations and a solid balance sheet, with $413 million in cash and marketable securities, indicating financial stability and room for further investment.
5. **Optimistic Outlook and Guidance**: Management expressed confidence in future growth, with guidance for fiscal year 2008 that includes revenue growth and margin expansion, despite the acknowledgment of increased investments in growth areas.

However, there are also some factors that could introduce volatility or caution:

1. **Increased Hiring and Investment**: The accelerated hiring and investment in various areas, while positive for long-term growth, could introduce short-term expenses and volatility in profit margins.
2. **Changes in Reporting Metrics**: The shift from quarterly to twice-annual subscriber reporting could create some uncertainty and volatility in expectations around subscriber growth.

Given these points, the overall tone of the transcript is positive, with strong financial performance, significant customer growth, and a robust product and platform strategy. This suggests that the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term.
