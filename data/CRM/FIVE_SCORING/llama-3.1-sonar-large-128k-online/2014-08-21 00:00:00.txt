- **Operational Margins and EPS**: The company reported non-GAAP EPS of $0.13, exceeding guidance, and anticipated further improvement in operating margins by 125 to 150 basis points for the full year. This suggests efficient operations and profitability[1][3][4].

- **Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships**: The integration of ExactTarget and the acquisition of RelateIQ are expected to enhance Salesforce's product offerings, particularly in the areas of marketing and data science.
