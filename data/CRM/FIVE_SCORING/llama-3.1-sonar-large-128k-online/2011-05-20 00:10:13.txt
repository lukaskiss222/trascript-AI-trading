For the current scenario involving Salesforce's Q1 FY2025 earnings, here are the key points to consider for the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Revenue Miss**: Despite an 11% year-over-year increase in revenue to $9.13 billion, Salesforce missed analysts' revenue expectations, which is a negative signal[1][3][4].

2. **Strong Operating Metrics**: The company reported significant improvements in operating margins, cash flow, and free cash flow, indicating robust operational performance. However, this may not fully offset the disappointment from the revenue miss[1][2][4].

3. **Guidance**: Salesforce maintained its full-year revenue guidance but adjusted its Q2 guidance slightly below consensus estimates, which could add to the short-term uncertainty[1][3][4].

4. **Market Reaction**: The stock experienced a significant drop following the earnings announcement, marking its worst day since 2004, which indicates immediate market disappointment[3].

Given these points, the initial market reaction and the slight miss on revenue expectations despite strong operational metrics suggest a short-term negative impact on the stock price.

**Rating: -1**
