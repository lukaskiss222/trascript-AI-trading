- **Revenue and Growth**: Salesforce reported a 37% year-over-year increase in revenue to $1.23 billion, exceeding expectations. This strong growth, combined with a raise in full fiscal year 2015 revenue guidance to $5.3-$5.34 billion, indicates robust business performance[3>'.
- **Deferred Revenue and Cash Flow**: Deferred revenue grew by 34% to $2.3 billion, and operating cash flow increased by 67% to $473 million. These metrics are critical for assessing the company's future revenue potential and financial health[3].
- **Operational Margins and Guidance**: The company reported non-GAAP EPS of $0.11, exceeding guidance, and committed to increasing non-GAAP operating margins by 125-150 basis points for the full year. This suggests effective cost management and operational efficiency[3].
- **Strategic Initiatives**: The success of the Salesforce1 Platform, industry-focused solutions, and strong performance in key verticals like insurance and retail further bolster the company's competitive position and growth prospects[3].
