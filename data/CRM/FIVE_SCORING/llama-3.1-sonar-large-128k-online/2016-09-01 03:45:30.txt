The transcript for Salesforce's Q2 2017 earnings call presents several key points that influence the short-term outlook for the company's stock.

### Positive Factors
- **Strong Revenue Growth**: Salesforce reported a 25% year-over-year revenue growth, reaching over $2 billion, a significant milestone. This growth was driven by solid performances across various clouds, including Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Marketing Cloud.
- **Expansion and Acquisitions**: The company made strategic acquisitions, such as Demandware and Quip, which are expected to drive future growth and enhance the company's product offerings. These acquisitions align well with Salesforce's strategy and have been well-received by customers and analysts.
- **Innovation and Product Launches**: The upcoming launch of Salesforce Einstein, an AI platform, is anticipated to be a major differentiator and growth driver. The company's focus on AI, platform, mobility, and productivity is expected to further enhance its competitive edge.
- **International Growth**: Salesforce saw strong growth in international markets, particularly in Europe and Asia Pacific, which adds to the company's overall revenue and market penetration.

### Negative Factors
- **Softness in U.S. Market**: There was some softness in the U.S. market at the end of the quarter, which was attributed to operational factors rather than competitive losses. However, this softness might raise concerns about short-term performance.
- **FX Impact**: Foreign exchange had a significant impact on the company's revenue and deferred revenue, which could continue to affect the company's financials in the short term.
- **Seasonality**: The company acknowledged a potential increase in seasonality as it grows into larger enterprise deals, which might affect the timing of revenue recognition.

### Conclusion
Given the strong revenue growth, strategic acquisitions, and exciting product launches, Salesforce's stock is likely to experience positive momentum in the short term. The softness in the U.S. market and FX impacts are transitory and do not seem to overshadow the overall positive outlook.
