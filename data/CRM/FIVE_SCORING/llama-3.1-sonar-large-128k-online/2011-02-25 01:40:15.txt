The Salesforce Q4 FY 2011 earnings call highlighted several key points that are relevant for predicting the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Salesforce reported a strong quarter with revenue of $457 million, a 29% increase from the year ago, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.31, which was at the high end of their guidance range. This indicates robust financial health and execution[3].

2. **Broad-Based Growth**: The growth was broad-based across all product lines and geographies, with significant wins in the Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Platform. This diversified growth reduces dependence on any single segment and suggests a strong market position[3].

3. **Increased Customer Adoption**: The company saw significant customer adoption, especially with Chatter, which was deployed by over 80,000 customers since its release. This high adoption rate and the positive feedback from customers are positive indicators[3].

4. **Guidance and Future Outlook**: Despite the strong quarter, the guidance for FY 2012 was cautious, with revenue expected in the range of $2.03 billion to $2.05 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.35 to $1.38. This cautious approach might temper immediate enthusiasm but does not indicate any underlying weakness[3].

5. **Investment in Growth**: Salesforce has been aggressively investing in growth, including significant hiring and strategic acquisitions. While this will impact short-term margins, it positions the company well for long-term growth[3].

Given these points, the stock is likely to see a neutral to slightly positive short-term impact due to the strong financial performance and continued growth momentum, despite the cautious guidance.
