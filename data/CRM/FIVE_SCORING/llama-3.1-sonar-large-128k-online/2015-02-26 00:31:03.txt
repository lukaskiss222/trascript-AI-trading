The earnings transcript for Salesforce Inc. indicates several positive factors that are likely to influence the stock price positively in the short term:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Salesforce reported a robust fourth quarter and full-year 2015, with revenue growing 26% year-over-year to $1.44 billion and full-year revenue increasing 32% to $5.37 billion. This exceeds expectations and demonstrates continued strong growth[1][3][5].

2. **Raised Guidance**: The company raised its fiscal year 2016 revenue guidance to $6.475 billion to $6.520 billion, despite facing foreign exchange headwinds. This indicates confidence in future growth and aligns with the company's ambitious goals, such as becoming the fastest software company to reach $10 billion in revenue[1][3][5].

3. **Operational Efficiency**: Salesforce improved its non-GAAP operating margin by 175 basis points and expects to continue improving margins by an additional 125 to 150 basis points in FY 2016.

4. **Strategic Growth Initiatives**: The company is seeing significant traction with its analytics platform, Wave Analytics Cloud, and is expanding its presence in key industries and geographies. The involvement of large system integrators (SIs) like Accenture and Deloitte is expected to further drive growth[1][3][5].

5. **CEO and Customer Engagement**: The CEO's involvement in large deals and the strategic alignment with customer growth agendas indicate a high level of trust and commitment from both customers and top executives, which is positive for long-term growth[1][3][5].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
