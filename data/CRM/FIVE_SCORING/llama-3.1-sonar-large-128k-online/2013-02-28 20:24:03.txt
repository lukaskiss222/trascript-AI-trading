Based on the information provided from the earnings call and financial results of Salesforce for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, here are the key points that influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Strong Q4 Performance**: Salesforce reported revenue of $9.29 billion, an 11% year-over-year increase, and beat earnings estimates with GAAP diluted EPS of $1.47 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.29[2][4][5].
2. **Guidance Short of Expectations**: Despite the strong Q4 performance, the company's guidance for the first quarter and full-year fiscal 2025 fell short of investor expectations, leading to a drop in the stock price in after-hours trading[2][4][5].
3. **Positive Long-Term Outlook**: Salesforce highlighted significant growth in its data cloud segment, a strong remaining performance obligation, and record cash flow and margin growth. The company is well-positioned for future growth, particularly in the AI sector[1][4][5].
4. **Initiation of Dividend and Share Buyback**: Salesforce announced its first-ever quarterly dividend and an increase in its share buyback program, which are positive signals for shareholder value[1][4].

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the weaker-than-expected guidance, despite the strong Q4 performance and positive long-term outlook.
