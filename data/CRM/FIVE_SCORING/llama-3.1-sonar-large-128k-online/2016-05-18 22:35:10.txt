For the recent Q1 FY2025 earnings report of Salesforce, several key points indicate the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Revenue Miss and Weak Guidance**: Despite an 11% year-over-year revenue increase to $9.13 billion, the figure fell short of analyst expectations, leading to a significant drop in the stock price. The Q2 revenue guidance also fell below analyst projections, which further dampened investor sentiment[3][4][5].

2. **Strong Operational Metrics**: However, the company reported strong operational results, including a 43% increase in free cash flow, a non-GAAP operating margin of 32.1%, and a sharp increase in adjusted net income per share. These metrics typically would be positive but were overshadowed by the revenue miss and weak guidance[1][2][5].

3. **Market Reaction**: The stock price plummeted by over 17% in extended trading following the earnings release, marking one of the company's worst days in nearly two decades. This reaction suggests a significant negative short-term impact[3][4][5].

Given these factors, the short-term impact on Salesforce's stock price is likely to be negative due to the revenue miss, weak guidance, and subsequent market reaction.
