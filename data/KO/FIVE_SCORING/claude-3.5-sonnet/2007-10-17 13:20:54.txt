Based on the earnings call transcript, I'm bullish on Coca-Cola's stock performance over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positives include:

1. Strong financial results with 19% revenue growth (11% excluding acquisitions), 15% EPS growth, and 6% global volume growth

2. International operations performing well with 8% volume growth and momentum in key emerging markets like China, Russia, India

3. Progress in North America with 1% growth after 5 quarters of declines, successful Glacau integration, and new distribution agreements with bottlers

4. Commodity cost pressures expected to moderate going into 2008

5. Management's confident tone about future growth and productivity initiatives

While there are some minor concerns around European performance and U.S. economic uncertainty, the overall results and outlook are quite positive and should drive positive sentiment in the stock.
