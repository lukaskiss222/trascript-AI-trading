Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a moderately positive short-term impact on Coca-Cola's stock price. Here's my reasoning:

Key Positives:
- Q4 performance came in slightly ahead of expectations
- Strong pricing/mix trends in key markets like North America (+4%)
- On track with productivity initiatives and $3B cost savings plan
- Gaining global value share in both sparkling and still beverages
- Added new billion-dollar brands to portfolio

Key Concerns:
- 2015 viewed as a "transition year" with mid-single digit EPS growth
- Significant currency headwinds (7-8 point impact on 2015 profits)
- Continued macroeconomic volatility in many markets
- Challenges in some emerging markets and Europe

Overall, while there are clear headwinds, management demonstrated good execution on strategic initiatives and cost management. The company appears to be making necessary changes while maintaining market share gains. The steady progress on productivity and pricing should support the stock in the near-term despite macro challenges.
