Based on the earnings call transcript, here is my analysis of the likely 1-2 week impact on Coca-Cola's stock:

Key Positives:
- Solid Q2 results with 4% global volume growth and 7% revenue growth
- Maintained market share and pricing power in key markets
- Strong emerging market performance (BRICS +8%)
- Sequential improvement in North American profitability

Key Concerns:
- Significant FX headwinds expected in Q3 (8-9% negative impact)
- Weaker gross margins due to consumer shifts to lower-margin channels
- Moderating growth in China and Brazil
- Poor weather and macro challenges in Europe (-4% volume)

The company demonstrated resilience and strong execution despite macro headwinds, but near-term pressure points around FX, margins and slowing growth in key markets will likely weigh on the stock in the very short term. While long-term fundamentals remain solid, the next 1-2 weeks could see some profit taking given these incremental challenges.
