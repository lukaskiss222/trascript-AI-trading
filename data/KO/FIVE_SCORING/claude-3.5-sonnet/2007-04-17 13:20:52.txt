Based on the detailed earnings call transcript, here's my analysis for Coca-Cola's likely stock movement in the next 1-2 weeks:

Positive factors:
- Strong international performance with 9% growth (highest since 2000)
- 17% revenue growth and 11% currency-neutral operating income growth
- Solid pricing power and mix benefits contributing to margins
- Continued momentum in emerging markets

Concerns:
- Weakness in North American market (-3% volume decline)
- Continued challenges in Philippines operations
- Higher input costs and pricing pressures
- Labor issues with bottlers in North America

The overall tone from management was cautiously optimistic, with clear acknowledgment of challenges but demonstrating strong execution internationally and clear strategies for improvement. The financial metrics were solid and above long-term targets, suggesting continued momentum.

Given the strong Q1 results, positive management outlook, and demonstrated pricing power despite challenges, I expect a moderately positive short-term stock reaction.
