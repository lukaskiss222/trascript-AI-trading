Based on analyzing this earnings call transcript, I would rate the likely short-term (1-2 weeks) stock impact as:

[-1]

Key reasoning:
- The company lowered guidance for 2014 and indicated 2015 performance would be similar to 2014's disappointing results, suggesting continued weakness
- While management announced a larger $3B cost savings program and strategic initiatives, they emphasized these would take time to implement with 2015 being a "transition year"
- Near-term headwinds remain including challenging macroeconomic conditions, soft consumer spending, and currency pressures that will likely weigh on the stock in the short term

The measured tone and emphasis on patience for results, combined with weak current performance and guidance, suggests modest downward pressure on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks as the market digests this outlook.
