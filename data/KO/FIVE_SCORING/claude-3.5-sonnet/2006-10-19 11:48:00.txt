Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis for Coca-Cola's likely short-term stock impact:

Positives:
- Solid 5% global volume growth with balanced performance across categories
- Strong international results, particularly in Latin America and Europe
- Effective pricing and mix driving revenue growth
- Management demonstrating ability to turn around bottling operations

Negatives:
- Continued challenges in key markets like Japan and North America
- Rising input costs pressuring margins
- Some weakness in non-carbonated beverages market share
- Conservative share repurchase activity in Q3

Overall, the company delivered results generally in-line with expectations while showing good execution on its strategic initiatives. The strong international performance and pricing power help offset regional challenges. While there are some headwinds, the fundamentals appear stable with management confident in their ability to deliver long-term targets.
