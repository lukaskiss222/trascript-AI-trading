Based on the earnings call transcript, Coca-Cola delivered strong Q1 2008 results despite economic headwinds. Key positives include:

- 6% global volume growth with strong international performance
- 21% revenue growth and 19% operating income growth 
- Continued strength in emerging markets like China, India, Russia
- Successful integration and performance of Glaceau acquisition
- Strong currency benefits and potential for reinvestment
- Management confidence in exceeding long-term growth targets

While North America showed some weakness due to economic conditions, particularly in foodservice, the company's geographic diversification and strong brand portfolio position it well. Management appears confident in their strategy and ability to deliver growth.

Given the solid results, positive management tone, strong international momentum, and potential for strategic reinvestment of currency benefits, I anticipate a positive short-term stock reaction.
