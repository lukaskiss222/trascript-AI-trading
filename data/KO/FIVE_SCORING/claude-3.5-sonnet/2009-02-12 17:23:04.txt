Based on this earnings call transcript, I would give a positive rating for Coca-Cola's short-term stock outlook. Here's my reasoning:

1. Strong financial performance: Delivered ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable EPS growth and met long-term growth targets despite challenging economic conditions.

2. Solid international growth: 6% volume growth internationally, with strong performance across emerging markets like China (19% growth) and India (14% growth).

3. Effective cost management: On track to deliver $500M in productivity savings by 2011, with good expense leverage demonstrated in Q4.

4. Strategic initiatives paying off: Success with new products, strong brand performance, and market share gains across key regions.

5. Management confidence: Leadership expressed clear strategies to navigate economic headwinds while maintaining investment in brands and growth.

While there are some headwinds (currency impact, North American challenges), the company appears well-positioned to maintain performance in the near term through strong execution and financial discipline.
