Based on this earnings call transcript, I assess that this will likely have a positive impact on Coca-Cola's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks for the following key reasons:

1. The company delivered solid Q1 results in line with expectations, with 4% global volume growth and continued market share gains in most regions.

2. Management expressed confidence in meeting full-year growth targets and maintained a constructive outlook despite some macroeconomic challenges. The optimization of US bottling operations announced shows strategic progress.

3. While there were some headwinds (currency, fewer selling days), these were well-telegraphed and temporary. The core business momentum remains strong with rational pricing and good execution globally.
