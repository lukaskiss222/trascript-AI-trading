Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Coca-Cola's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong financial performance with comparable EPS up 23% and operating income up 9% on a currency neutral basis, beating expectations

2. Management demonstrated confidence in their strategic initiatives, especially regarding the CCE North America acquisition and international growth opportunities

3. Improving trends in key markets like China (16% growth over past 6 months), Russia showing sequential improvement, and stabilization in North America

4. Clear strategic focus on productivity savings ($500M by 2011) and commitments to shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks

4. Positive management tone and detailed explanations of growth drivers suggest strong execution capabilities

Rating: [1] - Positive impact expected over next 1-2 weeks
