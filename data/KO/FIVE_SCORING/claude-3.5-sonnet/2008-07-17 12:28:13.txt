Based on the earnings call transcript, here is my analysis of the likely 1-2 week stock price impact:

The earnings report was moderately positive with some mixed signals:

Positives:
- Beat earnings expectations with 19% EPS growth
- Gaining market share globally
- Strong international growth continues
- Announced productivity savings of $400-500M by 2011
- Confident guidance maintained

Negatives:
- Volume growth of 3% was below expectations due to one-time factors
- Challenging U.S. market conditions expected to continue
- Rising commodity cost pressures
- Bottler CCE showing weakness with $5B impairment charge

Overall, while there are some headwinds, the company demonstrated resilient performance and maintained its outlook despite macro challenges. Management's confident tone and focus on productivity initiatives should provide support.

Short-term stock impact: Modestly positive

Rating: [1]

The management team's strong execution track record and commitment to meeting long-term targets, despite near-term challenges, suggests the stock should see a modest positive reaction over the next 1-2 weeks.
