Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess a positive short-term outlook for Coca-Cola's stock price. Key positive factors include:

1. Strong international growth, particularly in emerging markets like China (+29% Q4) and India (+20% Q4)
2. Solid cash flow generation with 8% growth to $8.2B for the year
3. Positive pricing despite challenging economic conditions
4. Major marketing initiatives around Olympics and World Cup expected to drive growth
5. Management confidence in meeting long-term growth targets

While there are some headwinds (currency impacts, slower developed market growth), the overall tone was confident and results exceeded expectations. The company appears well-positioned for continued growth.
