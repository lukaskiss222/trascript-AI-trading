Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my short-term stock price analysis for Coca-Cola:

The earnings call reveals several positive factors:
- Full year results at top end of long-term growth targets
- Strong international performance (6% volume growth)
- Solid execution in emerging markets
- Successful cost management and pricing strategies

However, there are some concerning headwinds:
- Weak North American performance expected in 2007, especially H1
- Unprecedented input cost pressures
- Lower cash balances and higher debt levels
- Mixed performance in key markets like Japan

The management's tone was cautiously optimistic but realistic about near-term challenges, particularly in North America. While the long-term strategy appears sound, the immediate headwinds in their largest market and cost pressures will likely weigh on investor sentiment in the short term.
