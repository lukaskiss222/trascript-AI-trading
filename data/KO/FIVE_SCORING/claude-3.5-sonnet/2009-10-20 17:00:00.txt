Based on this detailed earnings call transcript, I predict a positive short-term impact on Coca-Cola's stock over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positives include:

1. Strong international growth in key emerging markets (China +15%, India +37%, Mexico +9%) offsetting weakness in developed markets.

2. Currency headwinds are expected to turn into tailwinds in Q4 and 2010, which should boost reported results.

3. Management expressed confidence in meeting profit targets and highlighted strong cash flow generation, continued brand investments, and market share gains.

While there are some concerns around developed market weakness, particularly in North America, the overall tone was constructive and suggested business fundamentals remain solid with improving currency dynamics ahead.
