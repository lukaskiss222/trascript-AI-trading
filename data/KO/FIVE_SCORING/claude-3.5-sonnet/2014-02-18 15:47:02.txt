Based on the earnings call transcript, I predict a neutral to slightly negative short-term impact on Coca-Cola's stock price. Here's my reasoning:

While the company delivered on its full-year profit targets, several concerning items emerged:

1. Volume growth was below expectations in 2013, particularly in key markets like North America
2. Management acknowledged significant headwinds including:
- Currency pressures (expecting 7% headwind in 2014)
- Continued weakness in diet soda sales
- Challenges in emerging markets
- New tax impacts in Mexico

On the positive side:
- The company announced a new $1B productivity program
- Management expressed confidence in meeting long-term growth targets
- Strong market share position maintained globally

However, the defensive tone from management in responding to analyst concerns about the need for bigger changes, combined with near-term headwinds, suggests the stock is likely to face some pressure in the immediate term as the market digests these mixed signals.
