Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess this as a positive quarter for Coca-Cola with several encouraging indicators for short-term stock performance:

Key Positives:
- Strong volume growth of 5%, ahead of long-term targets
- North America showed organic growth for second consecutive quarter
- Successful international expansion, particularly in emerging markets
- Robust gross profit growth of 10% 
- Healthy cash flow growth of 15% year-to-date
- Successful closing of CCE transaction positions company well

Minor Concerns:
- Some currency headwinds expected in Q4
- Price/mix benefits remain minimal in North America
- Challenging conditions persist in parts of Europe

The overall tone from management was confident and they appear to be executing well on their strategic priorities. The integration of CCE's North American business and continued momentum in emerging markets should support stock performance in the near term.
