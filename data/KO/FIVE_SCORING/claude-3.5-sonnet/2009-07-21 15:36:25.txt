Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess that this will have a positive short-term impact on Coca-Cola's stock price for the following reasons:

1. The company reported strong Q2 results with 4% global volume growth (at the high end of expectations) and gained market share in most key markets despite challenging economic conditions.

2. Management demonstrated confidence by announcing the restart of their share repurchase program with plans to buy back up to $1B in stock in 2H 2009.

3. The company is successfully executing productivity initiatives while maintaining marketing investments, and management expressed optimism about sequential improvement in key markets like North America.

While there are some headwinds from currency and specific markets, the overall tone was positive with management reaffirming their ability to meet long-term growth targets. The resumption of buybacks and strong operational execution should support the stock in the near-term.
