Based on this earnings call transcript, Coca-Cola delivered solid Q1 2009 results despite challenging economic conditions. Key positives include:

- 2% global volume growth while gaining market share
- 17% operating income growth on a currency neutral basis
- Strong performance in emerging markets like India (+31%) and China (+10%)
- Successful cost reduction and productivity initiatives
- Maintained leadership position and brand strength

However, there are some headwinds:
- Significant currency impact (-17%) dragging down reported results
- Weakness in Eastern Europe due to economic conditions
- Mixed performance in developed markets

Management appears confident in their strategy and long-term growth targets while acknowledging near-term challenges. With strong brands, global reach, and execution capabilities, they expect to emerge stronger from the economic downturn.

Given the relatively solid performance in a tough environment and management's confident outlook, I expect a modestly positive short-term stock reaction.
