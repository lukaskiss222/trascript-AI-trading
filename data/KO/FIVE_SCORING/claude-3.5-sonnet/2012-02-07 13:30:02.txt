Based on the earnings call transcript, Coca-Cola delivered strong performance despite a volatile global environment. Key positives include:

- Volume and revenue growth across all geographic regions
- Strong pricing power with 4% pricing increase in North America
- Continued market share gains globally
- New productivity program targeting $550-650M in savings
- Healthy emerging market growth, especially in China and India
- Management confidence in maintaining pricing premiums
- Strong cash flow and dividend/buyback commitment

Some modest concerns include currency headwinds expected in 2012 and economic uncertainty in Europe. However, the company's global diversification, brand strength, and productivity initiatives position it well to navigate challenges.

Given the overall strong results, confident outlook, and multiple growth drivers, I expect the stock to react positively in the near-term.
