The Coca-Cola Company's earnings call reveals a positive outlook for 2008, with an emphasis on international growth and a solid foundation across its global markets. The broad-based growth in its international operations is notable, with particular strength in emerging markets. Management's focus on sustainability, efficiency, and still beverage expansion is encouraging. However, the potential macroeconomic headwinds and the impact of volatile commodities prices cannot be ignored. The stock is likely to react neutrally in the short term, consolidation after recent growth.
