The Coca-Cola Company's earnings call reveals positive Q1 results, with 6% global volume growth driven by all five geographic regions. However, the impact of recent events in Japan and increasing commodity costs are concerns. The company's focus on brand investment, packaging innovation, and channel expansion bodes well for long-term growth, but short-term pressures due to Japan may affect stock performance in the next few weeks. The management's confidence in mitigating these issues and maintaining full-year targets is reassuring. Overall, a slight negative impact on the stock is expected in the short run.
