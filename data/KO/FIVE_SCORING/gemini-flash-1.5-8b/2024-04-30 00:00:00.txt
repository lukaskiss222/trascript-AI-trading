Coca-Cola's Q1 2024 earnings call highlights continued momentum, but with some nuances.  Strong volume growth and margin expansion are reported, exceeding initial expectations, particularly in certain regions.  The company's updated guidance reflects a slightly higher revenue outlook, primarily due to higher-than-predicted inflationary pricing in specific markets. The call demonstrates confidence in the ability to navigate a complex global landscape, with a strong focus on execution, especially in areas like retail development.
