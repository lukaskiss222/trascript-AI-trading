Coca-Cola's Q1 2015 earnings call indicated continued positive pricing strategies and strong brand performance, driving organic revenue growth.  Management highlighted disciplined brand investments and productivity initiatives, aiming for $3 billion in annualized savings by 2019, though the precise impact of cost-cutting on the near-term P&L wasn't clearly highlighted.  The call also revealed concerns over macroeconomic volatility, particularly in several emerging markets, along with a slight delay in the Monster Beverage acquisition closing.  These factors suggest that investors should consider cautious optimism, though a favorable Q1 result should provide some support going into the next few weeks.
