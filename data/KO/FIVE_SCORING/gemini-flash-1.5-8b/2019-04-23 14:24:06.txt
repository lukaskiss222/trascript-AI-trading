Coca-Cola's Q1 2019 earnings call indicates strong underlying performance, with 6% organic revenue growth and 16% comparable currency-neutral operating income growth.  Management highlighted successful innovation, particularly in the Coke Zero Sugar brand and new product launches like Coke coffee and Coke Energy, as key drivers.  While currency fluctuations and acquisitions impacted margins slightly,  management is confident in achieving full-year guidance.  The short-term outlook for stock price is likely positive due to strong results and positive management commentary.
