Coca-Cola's earnings call highlights continued global growth (4% volume, 5% year-to-date) across multiple regions. Management expresses confidence in achieving 2020 Vision targets and notes a shift toward "future" consumption (take-home beverages) in Europe, though the company maintained share and pricing in North America.  Positive trends in Japan and India are detailed, but some challenges remain regarding cycling of prior strong performances.  The call suggests a short-term focus on managing global economic headwinds while continuing investments for long-term growth.
