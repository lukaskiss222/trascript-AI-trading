Coca-Cola's earnings call highlighted strong performance in 2017, exceeding guidance and demonstrating growth across many segments.  Management expressed confidence in 2018's 4% organic revenue growth, citing improved execution, portfolio expansion (especially the success of Coke Zero Sugar), and a slightly improved macro outlook.  The call also addressed accounting changes, tax reform implications, and ongoing refranchising initiatives, all of which will likely impact the company's short-term stock performance.
