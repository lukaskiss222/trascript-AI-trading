Coca-Cola's earnings call highlights a strong financial performance despite macro headwinds.  Management emphasizes that one-time events (strikes, weather) negatively impacted Q2 volumes, but share gains in many key markets suggest the company's strategies are working.  The company anticipates continued challenges in the near term, particularly in North America, but remains optimistic about long-term growth and is actively implementing productivity initiatives.
