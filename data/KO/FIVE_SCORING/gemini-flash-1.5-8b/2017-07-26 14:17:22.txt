Coca-Cola's Q2 2017 earnings call highlighted strong performance in key markets (North America, Europe, Mexico) despite weaker conditions in some emerging markets. Management emphasized continued success in driving revenue growth through portfolio enhancement, innovation, and effective revenue management strategies.  While the call confirmed guidance expectations, it also mentioned macro headwinds and potential for continued volatility in the back half of the year, particularly in Brazil and some ASEAN countries.  The company's focus on refranchising its bottling operations and a leaner operating model adds long-term value.
