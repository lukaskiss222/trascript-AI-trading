Coca-Cola's earnings call highlights strong organic revenue growth (15% in Q4 2022) despite a challenging macro environment, driven by pricing actions and revenue growth management initiatives.  Management is confident in the company's ability to deliver on 2023 guidance (7-8% organic revenue growth), attributing this to a continuation of volume momentum, moderating inflation, and their ability to adapt to the evolving economic backdrop.  The call suggests a focus on a balanced approach to affordability and premiumization, with investments in both areas.
