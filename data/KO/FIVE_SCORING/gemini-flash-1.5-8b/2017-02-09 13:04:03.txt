Coca-Cola's earnings call highlights a focus on long-term growth through brand-centric strategies and refranchising, even with short-term challenges.  Management anticipates a similar environment in 2017, with some projected declines in EPS due to refranchising impacts and macroeconomic volatility, though the core business is expected to maintain a positive trajectory.  The call suggests a short-term period of adjustment as the company transitions to a new CEO and refocuses toward consumer needs, but a positive outlook for the future is presented.
