Coca-Cola's earnings call highlighted strong performance in 2006, exceeding targets for volume, operating income, and EPS.  Management expressed confidence in the company's long-term strategy, particularly in emerging markets, but noted concerns about the first half of 2007 due to cycling effects in North America and input cost pressures.  While acknowledging challenges, the call emphasized collaborative efforts with bottling partners to address issues and improve the overall franchise system.  This suggests a potential short-term dip followed by improvement in the stock's performance, though the precise impact is contingent upon the success of these initiatives.
