Coca-Cola's earnings call indicates strong performance despite the challenging US economic environment.  Robust international growth, particularly in emerging markets, offsets weaker results in North America. Management's confidence in long-term strategies and continued investment in brands suggests a positive outlook.  Short-term impact is likely positive as the stock may reflect the company's ability to manage through economic headwinds.
