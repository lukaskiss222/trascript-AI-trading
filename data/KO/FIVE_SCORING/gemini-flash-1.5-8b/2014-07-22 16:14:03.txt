Coca-Cola's Q2 2014 earnings call highlights strong global volume growth (3%) and price mix (2%), driven by successful marketing campaigns and a disciplined pricing strategy.  Management expresses confidence in continuing this momentum, attributing the performance to their five strategic priorities and expecting the company to remain within the corridor of its long-term growth targets.  External factors like the slowing global economy are acknowledged but not seen as significant impediments.
