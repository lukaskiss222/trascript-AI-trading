Coca-Cola's Q1 2016 earnings call highlighted continued execution on their five-point growth plan, with notable progress in certain regions like North America, Latin America, Japan, and India.  Management expressed confidence in achieving their full-year targets despite a challenging global macro environment.  The call included discussion on new initiatives like a global one-brand marketing strategy and acquisitions adding to the still beverage portfolio.  This, likely, will lead to moderate short-term to mid-term stock price appreciation.
