Coca-Cola's Q2 2010 earnings call emphasized continued growth, particularly in emerging markets.  Management highlighted strong brand performance, share gains, and positive volume trends, exceeding expectations in some regions.  Guidance suggests a slightly negative currency impact in the back half of 2010, but overall, the tone is optimistic about long-term growth in a still-volatile global economy.  The call strongly indicates positive short-term momentum for the stock.
