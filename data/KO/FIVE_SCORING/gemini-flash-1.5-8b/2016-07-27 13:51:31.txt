Coca-Cola's Q2 2016 earnings call highlighted a significant slowdown in volume growth, primarily due to weakening demand in key emerging markets like China, Argentina, and Venezuela.  Management lowered guidance for full-year consolidated organic revenue growth, citing cyclical macroeconomic pressures.  However, the company maintained its underlying profit target, emphasizing the strength of its core franchise operations and successful price increases.  This suggests a potential short-term negative impact on the stock due to the cautious outlook, but the focus on long-term growth strategies and resilient core performance may limit the downside.
