Coca-Cola's Q1 earnings call highlighted strong volume growth across various segments, driven by a shift from price increases to increased sales.  Management emphasized the sustainability of this growth and confidence in delivering full-year guidance.  While some challenges remain, particularly in North American pricing and potential impacts from the UK and South African sugar taxes, the overall tone suggests a positive outlook for the stock in the near term.
