Coca-Cola's Q1 2007 results showed impressive growth, especially in international operations, with strong volume increases and positive price mix. Management expressed optimism about overcoming North American challenges, indicated by sequential improvement planned for the yearâ€™s second half, innovations like Coke Zero and Diet Coke Plus, and strategic partnerships. However, continuous investments for growth and potential cost pressures from acquisitions like the Philippine bottler might temper this enthusiasm. Given these factors, the stock is likely to see upward movement in the short term, though further information on North America's progress would solidify this prediction.
