Coca-Cola's Q1 2010 earnings show consistent global growth with a focus on innovation and a robust international performance, particularly in emerging markets. Despite tempered volume growth in North America and ongoing pricing challenges, the management's decisive moves to restructure operations signal an intent to strengthen the company's position in developed markets. The positive currency impacts and an expectation of improving price mix into the year suggest a stabilization and potential for slight upward movement in stock price over the next two weeks.
