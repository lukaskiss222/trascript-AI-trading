The Coca-Cola Company's Q2 2009 earnings call indicated strong brand health, share gains in many regions, and a focus on cost savings, which are all positive signals. However, the company faced significant currency headwinds, causing a reported operating income decline and EPS decrease. Despite these challenges, the company's volume growth aligns with long-term targets, suggesting resilience in its core business. Additionally, the resumption of the share repurchase program signals management's confidence in future performance. Overall, while there are short-term headwinds, these are likely to be temporary, and the fundamental strength of the business should lead to a mild positive impact on the stock over the next 1-2 weeks due to strategic initiatives and consumer demand.
