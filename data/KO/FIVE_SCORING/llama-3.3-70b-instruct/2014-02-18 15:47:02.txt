The Coca-Cola Company's earnings transcript reveals a mixed bag of results, with the company achieving record sales but facing challenges in certain markets. Despite these challenges, the company remains committed to its 2020 vision and is taking steps to restore momentum, including increasing media investments and expanding its still beverage portfolio. Management's tone is optimistic, and they believe that their programs will work to drive growth. However, the company's guidance for 2014 is cautious, with expected currency headwinds and uncertainty around the impact of recent tax changes in Mexico. Overall, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and macroeconomic uncertainties, but management's confidence in their long-term growth prospects may help mitigate this pressure.
