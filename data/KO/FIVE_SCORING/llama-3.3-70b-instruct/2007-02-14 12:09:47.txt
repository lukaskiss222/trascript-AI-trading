The Coca-Cola Company's Q4 earnings call revealed a solid 2006 performance, with 4% unit case volume growth, 8% operating income growth, and 9% EPS growth, meeting the company's long-term growth targets. The company's geographic diversity, daily execution, and focus on core brands drove success. However, North America's performance was disappointing, with a 3% decline in sparkling volume. Despite this, management expressed confidence in their ability to address issues and drive growth, with a focus on innovation, revenue growth management, and franchise leadership. The company's guidance for 2007 suggests a relatively positive macroeconomic outlook, with expectations for solid performance in most markets, despite weakness in North America.
