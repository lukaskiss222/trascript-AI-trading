The Coca-Cola Company's Q4 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with the company beating expectations slightly due to better-than-expected top-line performance and lower operating expenses. However, the guidance for 2015 was tempered, with the company expecting mid-single-digit comparable currency neutral EPS growth, which is roughly in line with 2014's growth rate. The company is making progress on its strategic actions to reignite growth, including investing in brands, refranchising bottling operations, and driving efficiency through productivity initiatives. Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, the company remains confident in its ability to deliver long-term value to shareholders. Given the mixed results and tempered guidance, the stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly negative impact in the short term.
