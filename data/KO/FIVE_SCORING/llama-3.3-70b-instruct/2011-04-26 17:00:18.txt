The Coca-Cola Company's Q1 earnings call revealed a strong start to the year, with 6% worldwide volume growth and consistent quality growth across all geographic operating groups. Despite challenges such as the tragedy in Japan and global commodity cost pressures, the company delivered comparable earnings per share of $0.86, up 7% versus the prior year. Management expressed confidence in meeting long-term growth targets, driven by brand strength, marketing investments, and strategic initiatives like package mix and pricing architecture. The company also updated its full-year guidance, expecting a low to mid-single-digit positive benefit from currency and a $250 million to $300 million increase in commodity costs.
