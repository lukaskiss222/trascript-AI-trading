The Coca-Cola Company's Q3 earnings call revealed a strong financial performance, with double-digit comparable EPS growth of 17% and a 5% increase in unit case volume. Despite a challenging economic environment, the company's international markets, particularly Latin America, Eurasia, and Africa, delivered solid growth. The company's focus on emerging markets, innovation, and productivity initiatives is expected to drive long-term sustainable growth. Although the company expects economic growth to moderate in 2009, it remains confident in its ability to navigate the challenging environment and deliver strong results. The acquisition of Huiyuan Juice Group in China is expected to complement the company's existing leadership in China and expand its presence in still beverages.
