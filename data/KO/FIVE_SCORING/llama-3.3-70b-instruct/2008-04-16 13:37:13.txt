The Coca-Cola Company's Q1 2008 earnings call revealed a strong start to the year, with 6% volume growth and 21% revenue growth. Despite a challenging economic environment in North America, the company achieved slight volume growth in the region and gained market share. International operations drove results, with 7% unit case volume growth, and emerging markets such as China, India, and Russia delivered double-digit growth. The company's still beverage portfolio outperformed the industry, and acquisitions like Glaceau and Fuse continued to perform ahead of expectations. Management expressed confidence in achieving long-term growth targets and announced plans to reinvest currency benefits into marketing programs and productivity initiatives.
