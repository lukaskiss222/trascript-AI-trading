Coca-Cola has a positive outlook for 2023, with anticipated continuous volume growth and a modest uptick in pricing as inflation moderates. Management exudes confidence, citing robust consumer demand and strategic brand investments, reinforcing their ability to weather market volatilities. However, geopolitical tensions and currency volatility remain concerns.
