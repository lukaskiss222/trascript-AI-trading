The Coca-Cola Company's fourth quarter and full-year 2011 earnings call presented several positive and resilient performance metrics despite a volatile global economic landscape. Here are the key points:

- **Volume and Revenue Growth**: The company achieved volume growth of 3% in the quarter and 5% for the full year, meeting or exceeding long-term growth targets. Revenue grew 5% in the quarter and 33% for the full year, partly due to the acquisition of Coca-Cola Enterprises' North American operations[1][4].
- **Profit Performance**: Comparable earnings per share (EPS) grew 10% for both the quarter and the full year, ahead of long-term targets. Operating income was up 14% in the quarter and 12% for the full year[1][4].
- **Brand Performance**: The company gained global volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, with strong performances from brand Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, and other still beverages. Brand Coca-Cola grew by 3% in both the quarter and the full year[1][4].
- **Emerging Markets**: Strong growth was observed in emerging markets such as China, India, and Latin America, which is expected to continue[1][4].
- **Productivity and Cost Savings**: The company launched a new 4-year productivity and reinvestment program aiming for $550 million to $650 million in annualized savings by 2015. This, along with the integration of CCE, is expected to enhance brand-building initiatives and mitigate commodity cost increases[1][4].
- **Currency and Commodity Impact**: Despite expected commodity cost pressures and currency fluctuations, the company is confident in its ability to manage these through pricing actions and productivity efforts[1][4].

Given these points, the short-term outlook for The Coca-Cola Company's stock is positive due to:

- Strong financial performance and meeting long-term growth targets.
- Robust brand health and market share gains.
- Effective management of commodity costs and currency fluctuations.
- Continued investments in emerging markets and productivity initiatives.
