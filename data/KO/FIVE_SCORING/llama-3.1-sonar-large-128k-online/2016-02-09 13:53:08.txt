The Coca-Cola Company's Q4 2015 earnings call presents several key points that influence the short-term outlook for the stock:

1. **Accelerated Refranchising**: The company announced plans to refranchise 100% of its North American bottling territories by the end of 2017, which is expected to lead to significant structural changes and temporary dilution but ultimately result in higher margins and returns[5].

2. **Performance and Guidance**: Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, the company delivered solid revenue growth and market share gains. For 2016, they expect organic revenue growth of 4% to 5%, and comparable currency-neutral income before tax to grow 6% to 8%[5].

3. **Productivity and Cost Savings**: The company is maintaining its $3 billion productivity program target, despite losing some savings due to refranchising, by identifying additional opportunities in cost of goods sold, operating expenses, and marketing[5].

4. **Market Share and Pricing**: Coca-Cola gained global value share and saw positive price/mix performance, particularly in North America, driven by increased marketing efforts and a focus on smaller package sizes[5].

5. **Currency and Macro Impact**: The company faces currency headwinds, especially in emerging markets, but is hedged on major currencies for 2016. Despite macro challenges, they are confident in their ability to deliver financial targets[5].

Given these points, here are the key takeaways for the short-term impact on the stock:

- The accelerated refranchising and associated structural changes may introduce some short-term complexity and dilution, but the long-term benefits are clear.
- Solid performance in revenue growth, market share gains, and productivity efforts suggest underlying strength.
- The company's ability to navigate macroeconomic challenges while maintaining guidance is positive.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive impact in the short term. The anticipation of long-term benefits from refranchising and solid current performance should support the stock, despite some short-term dilution and macroeconomic headwinds.
