The Coca-Cola Company's first quarter 2009 earnings call presents a mixed but generally positive outlook, despite the challenging global economic environment. Here are the key points:

- **Volume and Revenue Growth**: The company reported a 2% global unit case volume growth, with international operations increasing by 3%. This growth was driven by strong performances in key markets such as Mexico, Brazil, India, and China[5>.
- **Operating Income and Profitability**: Despite a 1% decline in reported operating income due to currency fluctuations, the company achieved a 17% increase in operating income on a currency-neutral basis, exceeding their long-term profit targets[5>.
- **Productivity Initiatives**: Coca-Cola is on track to deliver $500 million in annualized savings from productivity initiatives by year-end 2011, which is ahead of schedule[5].
- **Currency Impact**: The company faced significant currency headwinds, particularly in emerging markets, but expects this impact to moderate as they cycle through stronger historical currency rates in the second quarter[5>.
- **Brand Performance and Market Share**: Coca-Cola continued to gain share in both sparkling and still beverages globally, with notable successes in brands like Coke Zero, Sprite, and Vitaminwater[5].
- **Financial Flexibility and Share Repurchase**: While the company has not yet reinstated its share repurchase program, it is under consideration and will be discussed with the board. The focus remains on maintaining financial flexibility and exploring strategic investment opportunities[5].

Given these points:

- The company's ability to deliver volume growth, exceed long-term profit targets, and manage currency impacts positively suggests a strong operational foundation.
- The ongoing productivity initiatives and brand performance are likely to continue supporting the company's growth.
- However, the short-term impact of currency fluctuations and the macroeconomic environment may introduce some volatility.

### Conclusion

The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term, driven by the company's solid operational performance, effective management of challenges, and continued focus on strategic growth initiatives.
