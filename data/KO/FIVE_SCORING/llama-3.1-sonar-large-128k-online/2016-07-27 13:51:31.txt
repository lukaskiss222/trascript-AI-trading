The Coca-Cola Company's second-quarter 2016 earnings call highlights several key points that impact the short-term outlook for the stock:

1. **Lowered Organic Revenue Guidance**: The company reduced its full-year organic revenue growth outlook from 4-5% to 3%, primarily due to weaker performance in emerging and developing markets such as China, Argentina, and Venezuela. This reduction could negatively impact investor sentiment in the short term[3][5].

2. **Macroeconomic Headwinds**: Significant macroeconomic challenges, particularly in China and other emerging markets, are expected to persist for the remainder of the year. This ongoing pressure could continue to affect the stock negatively in the near term[3][5].

3. **Positive Price/Mix and Margin Expansion**: Despite the revenue challenges, the company achieved a 3% price/mix growth and expanded its operating margins. These positive metrics indicate effective pricing and productivity strategies, which could offset some of the negative impacts[1][3][5].

4. **Currency and Structural Headwinds**: The company faces significant currency and structural headwinds, which are expected to continue into the third quarter. These factors could further pressure the stock in the short term[3][5].

5. **Confidence in Core Business and Profit Targets**: Management remains confident in achieving their profit targets and in the long-term growth potential of the core business. This confidence could stabilize investor sentiment to some extent[3][5].

Given these points, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the lowered guidance, ongoing macroeconomic challenges, and currency headwinds. However, the company's ability to maintain profit targets and expand margins provides some stability.
