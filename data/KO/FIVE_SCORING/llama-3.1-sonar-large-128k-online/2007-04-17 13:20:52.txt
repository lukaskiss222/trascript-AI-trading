### Key Points:
- **Strong Global Performance**: The company reported a 17% increase in net revenue, driven by a 6% increase in worldwide unit case volume, the highest quarterly volume growth rate since 2002. International growth was particularly strong, with a 9% increase, led by emergent markets like China, Russia, and Latin America[5].
- **North American Challenges**: Despite global success, the North American market experienced a 3% decline in volumes, attributed to pricing headwinds and other market pressures.

- **Financials**: EPS increased by 15% to $0.54, with adjusted EPS at $0.56 after considering items impacting comparability. Operating income grew by 17%, with a 3% benefit from currency. The company also announced a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend and plans to repurchase $2.5 to $3 billion of its stock in 2007[5].
- **Productivity and Innovation**: The company is focusing on productivity improvements, delayering the organization, and enhancing supply chain efficiency. Innovation initiatives, such as the rollout of Coke Zero and Diet Coke Plus, are expected to drive further growth[5].
- **Macro Economic Outlook**: The company remains positive on the macroeconomic outlook, especially in emerging markets, and expects solid performance in most markets despite weakness in North America[5].

### Short-Term Impact on Stock Price:
Given the strong global performance, solid financial results, and positive outlook despite North American challenges, the stock is likely to see a positive short-term impact. The company's ability to drive growth internationally, its commitment to innovation and productivity improvements, and the continued investment in brand and market initiatives are all positive indicators.

### Conclusion:
The stock is expected to experience a positive short-term impact due to the company's overall strong performance and strategic initiatives aimed at addressing current challenges.
