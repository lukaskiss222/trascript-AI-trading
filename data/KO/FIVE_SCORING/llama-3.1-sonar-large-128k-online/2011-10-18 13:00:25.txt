The Coca-Cola Company's third-quarter 2011 earnings transcript presents a strong performance despite global market volatility. Here are the key points that influence the short-term impact on the stock:

- **Strong Volume and Revenue Growth**: The company reported a 5% global volume growth for the quarter and 6% year-to-date, with comparable earnings per share up 12% for the quarter and 10% year-to-date. This performance is in line with or ahead of long-term growth targets[5}.
- **Market Share Gains**: Coca-Cola gained volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages globally, including in key markets like North America, Latin America, and Europe[5].

- **Investment and Strategic Initiatives**: Significant investments in multi-year programs across various regions, including Asia, Latin America, and Europe, are expected to drive long-term growth. The company also emphasized its focus on immediate consumption and innovative packaging initiatives[5].
- **Financial Strength and Dividend Commitment**: The company highlighted its strong financial position, cash generation, and commitment to dividend payments, which adds stability and investor confidence[5].

Given these points, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive, reflecting strong execution, market share gains, and a solid financial position. However, the impact of currency fluctuations and commodity costs, although managed, introduces some uncertainty.
