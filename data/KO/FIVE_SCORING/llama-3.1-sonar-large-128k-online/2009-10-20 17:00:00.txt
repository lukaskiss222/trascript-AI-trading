The Coca-Cola Company's third-quarter 2009 earnings call presents a mixed but generally positive outlook, despite the challenging economic environment. Here are the key points influencing the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Strong International Growth**: The company reported significant volume growth in key international markets such as China, India, Mexico, and Brazil, which is a positive indicator of its global reach and resilience[4].

2. **Challenging Developed Markets**: However, the company faced challenges in developed markets like North America, Europe, and Japan due to weak consumer sentiment and economic headwinds. This could lead to some short-term volatility[4].

3. **Currency Impacts**: The company experienced an 11% currency headwind in the third quarter, but expects a low to mid single-digit currency tailwind in the fourth quarter. This suggests some relief from currency pressures in the short term[4].

4. **Operational Performance**: Despite the economic challenges, the company delivered sound and balanced revenue growth, with a 9% increase in comparable currency-neutral operating income. This indicates strong operational management and cost control[4].

5. **Marketing and Innovation**: Coca-Cola's focus on innovative marketing, brand-building, and strategic partnerships (e.g., FIFA, Live Nation) is expected to continue driving brand value and consumer engagement[4].

6. **Cash Flow and Share Repurchases**: The company reported strong cash flow from operations and announced continued share repurchases, which can be seen as positive for shareholder value[4].

Given these points, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive, highlighting the company's resilience in challenging economic times, its strong international growth, and its commitment to investing in brands and marketing. However, the short-term impact may be slightly muted due to ongoing challenges in developed markets.
