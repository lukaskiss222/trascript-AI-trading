The Coca-Cola Company's first-quarter 2013 earnings call presented several positive and neutral factors that could influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Factors:
- The company reported solid performance in line with expectations, gaining global value share in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages for the 23rd consecutive quarter.
- Worldwide volume grew 4%, with significant growth in both sparkling and still beverages, led by strong performances in brand Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite.
- The company announced a 10% increase in its annual dividend, marking the 51st consecutive annual dividend increase, which is a positive signal for shareholders.
- The implementation of a new 21st century beverage partnership model in the U.S. aims to enhance efficiency and customer focus, which could lead to long-term benefits.

### Neutral Factors:
- The company faced challenges such as two fewer selling days in the quarter, commodity inflation, and currency headwinds, which impacted operating income and gross margin. However, these are expected to moderate over the year.
- The competitive environment remains challenging, particularly in China and Europe, but the company's pricing strategy and investments in brand-building activities are expected to mitigate these challenges.

### Conclusion:
Given the solid performance, positive dividend announcement, and strategic initiatives despite some short-term challenges, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term.
