The Coca-Cola Company's first quarter 2011 earnings call highlights several positive and some challenging aspects that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Factors
- **Strong Volume Growth**: The company reported a 6% worldwide volume growth, with organic volume growth in all five geographic operating groups, which is ahead of their long-term targets[3].
- **Brand Performance**: Key brands such as Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Del Valle showed significant growth, with Fanta surpassing the $10 billion retail sales value threshold and Del Valle achieving $1 billion brand status[3].
- **Financial Performance**: Comparable EPS grew 7%, in line with long-term targets, and comparable operating income increased by 10%[3].
- **Integration and Synergies**: The integration of the North America business is proceeding as planned, with expected cost synergies of $140 to $150 million[3].
- **Cash Flow and Share Repurchases**: Strong cash flow and active share repurchase programs are also positive indicators[3].

### Challenging Factors
- **Japan Impact**: The earthquake and tsunami in Japan had a dilutive effect on earnings, estimated to be around $0.01 to $0.04 per share for the full year, primarily impacting the third and fourth quarters[3].
- **Commodity Costs**: Increased commodity costs, particularly PET, pose a challenge, although the company is actively mitigating these through pricing and supply chain initiatives[3].
- **Accounting Adjustments**: The application of the sales curve accounting policy for marketing expenses in the newly acquired North American business diluted first quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, which will reverse in the fourth quarter[3].

### Conclusion
Given the strong overall performance, successful brand growth, and ongoing integration synergies, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive. However, the challenges related to Japan and commodity costs may moderate this positivity slightly.
