The Coca-Cola Company's third-quarter 2017 earnings call highlighted several key points that are relevant for assessing the short-term impact on the stock price:

- **Solid Organic Revenue Growth**: Despite a 15% decline in net revenues due to refranchising, the company reported a 4% growth in organic revenues, driven by a 3% price/mix growth and 1% concentrate sales growth. This indicates strong underlying performance[1][3][5].

- **Operating Margin Expansion**: The company saw a significant expansion in operating margin, with a 400 basis points increase in comparable operating margin, driven by refranchising and productivity initiatives[1][3][5].

- **Global Value Share Gains**: Coca-Cola gained value share in various categories, including sparkling soft drinks, juices, and teas, which is a positive indicator of market performance[1][3][5].

- **Challenges in Latin America**: While there are ongoing challenges in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Venezuela, the company is taking steps to address these issues, such as adjusting price/package architecture and investing in new infrastructure. There are signs of improvement, but full recovery may take time[1][3][5].

- **Innovation and Portfolio Expansion**: The company is aggressively innovating and expanding its portfolio, including successful launches like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and investments in premium and emerging brands. This strategy is expected to drive long-term growth[1][3][5].

Given these points, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive, indicating that the company is on track to deliver its full-year plan despite some challenges. The solid organic revenue growth, margin expansion, and strategic innovations suggest a strong foundation for future growth.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the solid operating results, strong organic revenue growth, and the company's proactive strategies to address challenges and drive innovation.
