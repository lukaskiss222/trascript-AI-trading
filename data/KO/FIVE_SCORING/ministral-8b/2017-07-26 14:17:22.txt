Based on the earnings transcript for The Coca-Cola Company, the company's performance in the second quarter was in line with expectations, with organic revenue growth of 3% and underlying profit before tax growth of 6%. The company's strategic priorities, such as expanding its portfolio, driving revenue growth, and digitizing its enterprise, are on track. The company also highlighted its progress in refranchising its bottling operations and the positive impact of the new operating model on its performance. However, the company's guidance for the full year was slightly adjusted due to a better currency environment in the back half of the year, resulting in a $0.02 benefit to full-year EPS.
