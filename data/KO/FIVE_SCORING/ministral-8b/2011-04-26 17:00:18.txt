Based on the earnings transcript for The Coca-Cola Company, the short-term implications for the stock price are mixed. While the company reported strong earnings and growth in key markets, the impact of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, as well as the restructuring of the North American business, could lead to some volatility in the stock price. Additionally, the company's guidance for the year ahead is in line with expectations, but the uncertainty surrounding the full-year impact of the events in Japan could cause some short-term fluctuations. Overall, the stock price is likely to experience some volatility in the short term, but the company's strong fundamentals and long-term growth prospects suggest that the stock could rally in the longer term.
