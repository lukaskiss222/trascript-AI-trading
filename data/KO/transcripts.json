As usual I am going to make a few observations about the results, slightly more extended given that it's year end, and also highlight our accomplishments for 2006. And then, Gary is going to provide you with an overview for the financials, some additional perspective on '07.  It's been yet another solid quarter, and we achieved full year results at the top end of our long-term growth targets for volume, for operating income, and for earnings per share. We again demonstrated the geographic diversity of our business and we continued to focus on daily execution right across the globe.  For the year, we achieved 4% unit case volume growth resulting in ongoing currency neutral operating income of 8% and ongoing EPS growth of 9%. We also gained share -- numbers are just in -- globally, in all key categories with the exception only of ready-to-drink tea and coffee.  For the year, international operations delivered 6% unit case volume growth. Performance in Latin America was particularly strong, growing 7% while cycling 6% growth in the prior year. Additionally, we achieved double-digit growth in key emerging markets. Those include China and Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, with solid growth throughout Africa. The European Union group delivered 6% growth with solid results in Spain, Central Europe; and, happy to say, continued improvement in Northwest Europe. Japan finished the year down as we predicted, but again, as we predicted, delivered sequential improvement with fourth quarter growing by 2%.  The Philippines, by the way, continues to be a drag. In fact, the Philippine decline reduced our overall growth by 1% for the year. However, that was compensated for by the bolt-on acquisitions primarily in juice and water which therefore added 1% to the international unit case volume. So that balanced out the Philippines, but I just wanted to highlight the drag on those overall numbers.  North America. North America was obviously disappointing from a volume perspective but it did contribute with solid profit growth as we focused on operating expense management and also we had solid performance in food service and the Minute Maid business but that was offset with weakness in retail, particularly of course evident in the second half of the year. We are going to talk to you more about our 2007 expectations in just a few minutes, particularly around North America.  We have achieved the objectives that we set out for you at the beginning of the year. If I go back to December 2005 we articulated a clear and focused agenda. That was reinvigorate sparkling beverage growth; expand the footprint of our other core brands to capture emerging consumer needs; lead the franchise; and, address and of course, correct as issues arise.  I'd like to review our progress on each one of these.  First of all, reinvigorating sparkling beverage growth. Sparkling beverages, what we simply define as nonalcoholic ready-to-drink consumer beverages with carbonation grew 4% for the year and achieved its highest growth rate in almost a decade -- since 1998 to be exact. That success was driven, I'm happy to say, by our core global brands with trademark Coke up 3% -- again the highest rate since '98 -- and Fanta up 4%, Sprite up 5%. All these brands represented an additional 11.7 billion servings last year. Think about it; that's almost two additional servings for every single person on the planet.  I'll highlight trademark Coca-Cola, because we executed on four key global initiatives to drive growth.  The Coke Side of Life. Our integrated global Coca-Cola marketing campaign has now run in almost 100 markets representing over 85% of worldwide Coca-Cola volume. The Happiness Factory spot has been a star performer, scoring, in fact, as our best ever global commercial. I'm sure many of you have seen some of our other spots such as Video Game on American Idol and during the Super Bowl. It's not only good reviews. What these commercials are doing is driving increased efficiency, as our television commercial reuse rate was double our 2002 to 2005 average, resulting in a mid-teens percentage reduction in our overall TVC production and agency fees.  Second, in over 100 markets we launched an integrated marketing platform threaded together by a unifying theme We All Speak Football, supporting the very successful FIFA World Cup. We saw the results not only in volume but across key marketing scores such as favorite brand and purchase intent.  Third, the rollout of Coca-Cola Zero was a really important success, contributing almost one-third of trademark Coca-Cola's growth and driving incremental share gains by sourcing volume from competitors. In 2006, Coke Zero launched in 14 new markets from Australia to Ireland. By the end of 2007, we will have reached over 35 markets.  Last, interactive communications. CocaCola.com, our common Internet platform, launched in 31 countries in 11 languages and reached 664 million impressions. It is really a step change in recruiting and connecting our brands to teens in a truly unique way. We're really leveraging their passions for entertainment, for sports and for music.  In all, trademark Coca-Cola, Sprite, and Fanta contributed over half of the growth for the year, and as I mentioned earlier, we gained share in sparkling beverages globally.  Secondly, expanding the footprint of our core brands. We've done that by capturing emerging consumer need states and that was our second priority. Let me give you some data. 2006 we continued to build our innovation pipeline with the total of 1,383 total product and package launches: 590 of those were new, and 367 were existing products launched into new markets. Trademarks Dasani, POWERade, and Aquarius continue to perform solidly. In packaged water we gained share, excluding the impact of the strategic decision on the Dannon brands in North America. The sports and energy categories continued to be a strong growth area and a global opportunity.  Our juice platform continued to evolve. As you know, we're already the global leader in juice and juice drinks and we increased our global presence through trademark Minute Maid's expansion and key acquisitions. Trademark Minute Maid was launched in nine new countries and volume increased 7% with solid growth in China, Korea, Great Britain, and Belgium. In the U.S., our warehouse juice and juice drinks portfolio continued to gain volume and value share as we successfully implemented price increases in what is a difficult cost environment.  The acquisitions of Multon in Russia which took place during 2005 and the recent announcement of Jugos del Valle, the second largest producer of packaged juices and fruit-flavored beverages in Mexico and the largest producer in Brazil, solidify our global leadership in juice. In fact, it makes us number one in Latin America. The activity resulted in a one percentage point increase in our volume and value share of international juices and juice drinks.  Third on our agenda is leading the franchise. From my first day back I have stressed that the Coca-Cola Company, in order to excel, needs our whole system to be healthy and to be aligned. This is more than just a financial metric. It's about changing the mind-set of our people to take a total system focus and understand the value chain all the way from consumer to manufacturer.  But it's also about making the hard decisions, and we have done that time and again. In Germany, we have made significant progress on the creation of a one bottle system in order to move more effectively and more efficiently to serve the marketplace. In Latin America, we jointly created with our bottling partners a new system operating framework.  You have also seen us take control of our destiny in certain markets. In China with the Cary franchise the Company made a proactive decision which will clearly facilitate new long-term investment plans to expedite the already fast-growing China business. The most recent company announcement that the company has now agreed with our bottlers to acquire the remaining stake in the Philippines, and this is going to be a significant issue with regard to 2006 [sic]. You all know I have got a long history with the Philippines, and I believe that we can bring about a turnaround starting with that acquisition in 2007.  So let me come to the fourth point. Address and of course correct as issues arrive. Now, addressing issues is always going to be something that happens to a company that operates in 200 countries. What we did is we highlighted at the beginning of the year three markets in particular that needed addressing. They were the Philippines -- which we have already covered -- the European Union group, and India.  As for the EU group, particularly in parts of Western Europe and India, the results have certainly improved. For the EU group, we are continuing to see the results of world-class execution of our key programs and alignment with our bottling partners. The results: sparkling beverage growth of 4%, still beverage growth of 20% plus and our low or no calorie beverages amounting to 62% of our total growth.  2006 demonstrated our ability to remain focused on our commitments and to rebuild a solid foundation. Of course, we are not claiming victory. We must grow our core sparkling beverages, take share in emerging and existing store categories, and continue with breakthrough innovation.  India's fourth quarter results were certainly encouraging. Unit case volume increased 12%, and we certainly gained overall value share there as well. We would expect India to return to its prior growth story over the long term, and we will continue to reinforce the trust campaign, which has worked so well in supporting the safety and quality of every Coca-Cola product.  Additionally, during the year we highlighted Japan, as weakness in our core brands, particularly Georgia Coffee, impacted our results. We committed to you a sequential quarterly improvement, and we have delivered against our commitment in our fourth quarter. As I announced earlier unit case volume increased 2%, cycling a 1% growth in the prior year quarter.  The quarter's overall results reflect stabilization in performance and an improved position for growth in 2007. As you will note, we have quickly addressed issues in markets that have required it, and we put them back on the right path.  The last key market to address currently therefore is North America. In North America, we are not satisfied with our performance and in 2007, our system faces a challenging cost environment and weak sparkling beverage trends. We're now moving forward in a collaborative aligned way with our North American bottling system to meet the market challenges.  However, we do expect 2007 to be weak, particularly in the first half of the year, as we cycle strong performance in the prior year. The second half of 2007 we do, however, expect to see sequential improvement and evidence of momentum building in North America as we execute against our key goals. Leading growth in sparkling beverages led by trademark Coca-Cola is one of those key goals. Delivering the fastest value growth in still beverages is another. Finally, the other leg of the stool, being the preferred beverage partner for our customers.  No matter which market you examine the basics are clear. When an issue arose we quickly identified the root causes, developed and communicated our action plan, and delivered results. While I'm sure other issues will arise, our ability to better anticipate consumer and customer needs and provide customized solutions when executing our initiatives is going to allow to us rapidly address and course-correct when these unfortunate things occur.  Let me say this, however: while we achieved these short-term strategic operational and financial objectives there is more we now need to do. Our momentum is building as we begin to realize the extent of our full potential.  Before turning the call over to Gary I'd like to highlight some recent key management moves. First, I'd like to congratulate the gentleman sitting next to me, Muhtar Kent, who was elected by the Board in early December as President and Chief Operating Officer. This clearly recognizes the success of our international operations this year, but also Muhtar's 25 years of system experience and achievement.  Additionally we announced changes to our operating structure to align geographic responsibility. Glenn Jordan is going to assume responsibility for the Pacific Group including Japan, China, and the Philippines. Ahmet Bozer was promoted to lead the Eurasia group. Ahmet is a tremendous operator. You heard me talk about the Middle East results; Russia, part of his existing territory. He's got both company and bottling experience, a trend that you have seen developing in terms of a number of the appointments that we've made. He's certainly well deserving of his expanded responsibilities.  Muhtar, with his large bandwidth, and his belief in operational excellence, is going to be highly focused on our priorities for this year and we together look forward to coming back to you in the future to discuss our progress, and, of course, he's here to answer your questions later on. So I will now be focused on the job that I was originally recruited for, Chairman and CEO.  In summary, I believe that we now have in place a firm foundation from which to build our business going forward. Our strategies are working. We will continue to effectively manage our portfolio brands and countries to capture the highest value opportunities. We will undoubtedly hit bumps in the road along the way. That's what happens when you operate in 200 countries, but our strategies and objectives remain the same.  I believe that we have demonstrated our intent to lead the franchise with strength and capabilities in consumer marketing and customer and commercial leadership, and to take the right actions against a consistent focus on delivering superior long-term returns to our shareholders.  Now let me turn the call over to Gary. \n Gary Fayard: Thanks, Neville and good morning, everyone. As you saw in the release we had a very good year in 2006 and it's a great base to start 2007. We reported earnings per share for the year increased 6% to $2.16. This included a net charge of $0.21 per share primarily related to a non-cash impairment charge at CCE in the fourth quarter. After considering items impacting comparability in both years, earnings per share was $2.37 versus $2.17 in the prior year, a 9% increase.  For the quarter, we reported EPS of $0.29 per share, which included a net charge of $0.23 per share, primarily related to the CCE impairment charge after considering comparability items, EPS for the quarter increased 13%.  In addition, our 2006 underlying effective tax rate on operations was 22.4% versus the previous estimate that I had given you of 23.5%, to bring the effective tax rate for the year in line with the current estimate. We reported income tax expense at a rate of approximately 18.2% in the fourth quarter which resulted in a tax benefit of about $0.03 per share for the quarter and the year.  For the year, volume growth was 4% after considering factors impacting comparability and a 1% negative currency impact. Operating income growth was 8%, along with the ongoing EPS growth of 9%. All of those results at the top end of our long-term growth targets.  For the year, we repurchased $2.5 billion of our stock, an increase of 24% over the prior year and that added 2 points of growth to earnings per share for the year. Additionally, the company paid $2.9 billion as dividends in 2006. In all, a total return of 23% for 2006. The fourth quarter was a strong finish to a very solid year of performance.  Now turning to 2007, let me address some of the factors that we see impacting our outlook. Our benchmark for success will continue to be our long-term growth targets, 3% to 4% volume growth, 6% to 8% ongoing currency-neutral operating income growth, and high single-digit ongoing EPS growth.  In addition, our initial read on the macro economic outlook for the year is relatively positive, especially in many of our emerging markets. We will continue to portfolio manage globally as we expect solid performance in most of our markets with weak performance in North America, particularly in the first half as we cycle strong volume and profit results.  In Europe, while performance is improving we will face cycling the favorable weather through most of the second half 2007 and of course, the World Cup. However, we have solid plans in place and we'll continue to focus on executing the fundamentals of the business.  As with 2006, we would again expect our consolidated bottling operations to be a positive contributor as we focus on building world-class operations. Currently, we have not included the consolidation of the Philippines bottler in our plans. The Philippines bottler acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter. After the transaction is closed we will provide an update on our expectations for that business going forward.  In terms of input cost in 2007, there's certainly unprecedented upward pressure. However, this is primarily in North America for juice and sweetener. Although we do expect to see an increase, we will continue to manage the overall impact on our business just as we did in 2006 through appropriate pricing and other strategies.  We expect SG&A trends for 2007 to be similar to full-year 2006 results. We will continue to invest behind our brands and innovation initiatives. Additionally, selling and service expenses will increase as we invest for growth in our bottling operations as well as reflecting the impact of bottling operations we owned for only a partial part of the year in 2006.  General and administrative expenses were tightly controlled in 2006, and we will continue our disciplined approach in 2007. We would expect net interest cost to increase primarily due to lower cash balances and higher debt balances. You will note that our net debt balance going into 2007 is approximately $2 billion, double the level from a year ago. We would expect that level to increase during the year due to share repurchase dividends and capital spending. Also keep in mind that we reduced our ownership position in Coca-Cola FEMSA and our Turkish bottler along with CCE's recent announcement on restructuring that will impact our equity income.  With regard to taxes and as previously mentioned, we ended up the year with an underlying effective rate of 22.4%. Our best estimate for 2007 is that the full year underlying effective tax rate on operations will be about 23%. We anticipate that our range for share repurchase in 2007 will be between $2.5 billion and $3 billion.  Now let me turn to currency. As we look into 2007 based on current spot rates and the anticipated benefits of hedging coverage in place, we currently expect very little impact from currency in 2007. We have begun to put coverage in place and are effectively covered through the first half of '07 on the euro and for the first quarter on the yen.  From a CapEx standpoint, we purchased approximately $1.4 billion in property, plant, and equipment during 2006; for 2007 we expect that amount to increase to about $1.5 billion as we make investments in recently acquired bottling operations. Additionally, early last month we finalized the payment for the remaining shares of CCAG, our German bottler, as part of the exercise of our put-call provision that we previously disclosed the total amount of that payment was approximately $1 billion. For quarterly modeling purposes, we will have one less shipping day in the first quarter and one more in the fourth quarter as compared to 2006.  Before I close I wanted to touch on a comment in the release and that Neville referred to about the new reporting segments, the Pacific and Eurasia. Beginning in the first quarter we will begin to report these geographically realigned operating segments and as we get closer to the first quarter release we will provide you with historical data on the new segments.  That's it for the topics I wanted to cover this morning. Neville, Muhtar and I are now ready for your questions. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from the line of Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus. \nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus : Neville or Gary, nice to see Japan improving in terms of the top line; yet if you look at the whole region which it's a part of and dominates in terms of profits, profits declined at an increasing rate there. It seems hard not to conclude that you really stepped up spending in Japan in the quarter in terms of SG&A level there. Is that a reasonable conclusion? If not can you talk to us a little about what's going on at the GP and SG&A line in the larger North Asia? \n Gary Fayard: What I would say first for that segment is to look more at really the full year. What you see is some swings in gallon shipments between the third quarter and the fourth quarter in Japan where gallons were up in the third quarter and down in the fourth quarter, full year that evens out, so it's kind of a quarterly spread within that region, particularly around Japan. So if you look at the full year I think you'll get a better picture of what it really looks like. \n Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus:  That's helpful. When you say gallon shipments down in the quarter in Japan, Gary, we got a 2 on the unit volume. What level of spread are we talking about versus that 2? Obviously it's at least 2, but what's the number? Can you give us an idea? \n Gary Fayard:  It's probably like a point. \n Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: An added point. So call it down one versus up two? \n Gary Fayard:  No, like plus two versus plus one. \n Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Actually, I'm still wondering now in light of that. Doesn't seem like enough to explain what happened in North Asia. \n Ann Taylor:  Mark, what I would suggest that the full year Japan gallons in unit cases are in line so we are not in an inventory build or de-stock position in Japan, so I think that's really the important thing. \n Gary Fayard:  It's really a swing between quarters. \nOperator:  Your next question will come from the line of Bryan Spillane with Banc of America. \n Bryan Spillane - Banc of America: Good morning. Just a question regarding input costs going into '07. We're all pretty well aware of what's happening in North America, but when you look outside of what's happening here, can you talk a little bit about what the input cost inflation looks like for bottlers outside of North America? Is that going to impact your plans in terms of maybe having to raise more prices in some of the developing markets and just the way you are going to go to market in '07 maybe relative to the way you did in '06. \n Neville Isdell:  Very significant difference between North America and rest of world. First of all, one of the major input costs in North America is HFSS. We are using sugar largely in the rest of the world, and where we're not, HFSS prices are actually tied to sugar prices. Had you asked that question six months ago when sugar was at a high it would have been a different answer but it's come back right down to the level it was at prior year. In fact, there may almost be a slight benefit with that.  Then you have got to look at your mix in terms of packaging. PET costs are going to be lower because of new capacity that comes on, offsetting some of the increases in terms of some raw materials for PET. You then have a larger mix of glass and glass bottles as well, so cans are a much smaller piece. We don't see any major cost inflation; there are going to be pockets in one or two countries, but there's really no unusual increase that we see that are going to impact our overall volume in the international business. \n Bryan Spillane - Banc of America:  Okay. So relative to your pretty favorable macro view in the emerging markets it sounds like it's a pretty supportive cost environment as well. \n Neville Isdell:  Yes, it is. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of Bill Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley. \n Bill Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley: Good morning, everybody. A question on North America. Obviously a tough '07, the sparkling volume was down 3% in the fourth quarter so can you talk about both '07 and then even multi-year what is the system approach to more rapidly diversifying and accelerating the growth in the sparkling category? Both the challenges of '07 and then from a longer term perspective? \n Neville Isdell:  I'm going to hand part of this over to Muhtar, but let me make a headline comment. You know that we took some controversial action in order to be able to get our system better able to address the needs of the customer and the consumer, and what comes out of these things is some very good deep discussion about where the business is headed. Sandy Douglas has done a great job in terms of leading that.  Muhtar spent yesterday with the whole U.S. bottling system in terms of looking at '07 and how we move ahead as a team. I think you heard some of in that John Brock's call yesterday in terms of how the overall feeling as to how we work together has changed, but let me ask Muhtar to give you some more flavor. \n Muhtar Kent : There's no doubt 2007 will be a challenging year, with the cost increases that was referred to in the earlier question, but I want to just reiterate that we remain excited about the long-term growth opportunities and our system's ability together to capture that growth here in North America. Critically I want to stress that we are leaving behind confrontation and moving to a system that is a good working relationship based on cooperation and collaboration with our entire bottling partners here in North America. I think that's very important and critical, and whenever you see us aligned with our bottling system I've always said, I'll reiterate, the system is unbeatable. I think I can reiterate that, having spent the whole day with our U.S. bottling partners yesterday, in a meeting looking at how we capture those opportunities.  The innovation is certainly going to be there, particularly in the second half, and we will be leading growth in sparkling beverages led by trademark Coca-Cola, delivering certainly also fast value growth in still beverages, Fuse is an early proof point. It's not certainly the end of the game. Being the preferred partner for our customers is going to be a key element in how we improve that relationship and become the preferred partners to our customers is going to be key.  Strong innovation across sparkling and still portfolio as well as consumption, packaging, you will see that certainly being a key element as we move into the second half, particularly. But the full year, of course, as you heard from John Brock, is going to be weak, and you will see a better second half than the first half. \n Bill Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley:  If I could just follow-up with one question on the North America profits, will there be certain leverage that you pull to help offset the volume weakness in the cost pressure, or is it more of a portfolio approach and you rely more on the international and the COBO profits, recognizing North America profit is going to be down? \n Muhtar Kent :  Certainly you'll see us managing it on a portfolio basis but there will be a great amount of attention also being paid to the cost side to ensure that we can find the leverages where we can, but you are not going to see us cut back on spending on our brand. \n Bill Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley:  Thank you. \n Neville Isdell:  If I could add just one thing, Bill, there's an awful lot that happened last year that flows through. I have just one small proof point, My Coke rewards. We got 3.3 million registered users. We have given out about 1.5 million rewards. That's just one little piece of what's happening. You have seen the acceleration of Zero. Vault has been a successful launch. Zero, as I say, has cycled positively in its launch period. You are going to see that growing. So it's not as if we're not coming off a platform where we don't have some ammunition to come into a weak cost environment.  But again, on the broader piece to reiterate what Muhtar said, really back to what we talked about six months ago with regard to Japan. We believe that we can meet the long-term objectives that we've given to you by balancing the overall portfolio. \n Bill Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley:  Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Torres - HSBC. \n Lauren Torres - HSBC:  Good morning. As somewhat of a follow-up to the previous question I was hoping you could you talk a little bit more about the relationship you have now with your bottlers and your strategy regarding testing and potentially shifting to alternate routes to market? How will this impact how the bottlers distribute your brands and ultimately share in the profits? \n Muhtar Kent : In terms of what you asked about alternative routes to market, that's certainly something we always are looking to see how we can improve our routes to market, the DSD system being the key to our success and our future but also how we can complement and supplement that, not as an alternative, but as a complement and a supplement and that's what you read about in the recent settlement.  I think the key question here is that we, jointly with our bottlers, have established a very, very clear process to identify the new opportunities and to develop or acquire the brands or products needed to respond to these opportunities together. I think that's the key important piece of the collaboration going forward. As I said before, this is the basis of our franchise leadership.  We have talked about how we need to ensure that we do the three things on our triangle extremely well, which is integrated consumer marketing, commercial and customer leadership and franchise leadership, and that is what we are talking about here is a key component of one of those three key pieces moving forward, which is franchise leadership. \n Lauren Torres - HSBC:  In markets so far where you are testing these alternate routes to market can you give us a sense of what the customers are saying? \n Muhtar Kent :  I don't think that we have any example where we have these alternative routes to market that we can give you examples of across the world. I think what you see here is certainly, because of the specialness of the U.S.A. market with food service, I think outside of the United States we use many different alternative routes to market but there isn't a single one that we can say this will be the model for the United States this is a test in how we move forward to find better ways to serve our customers. \n Lauren Torres - HSBC: Thank you. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher - JP Morgan. \n John Faucher - JP Morgan:  Yes, good morning, everyone. It looks as though after a tough couple of first quarters to start the year where the cash flow was down, and some of that I think was due to taxes, cash flow looks like it's been up the past couple of quarters. Gary, can you give us maybe a trajectory on cash flow for next year in terms of would we should look for? \n Gary Fayard:  Yes, and first, John, just off the headline of your little release this morning, Happy Valentine's Day to you. On cash flow, I would say a couple of things. Let me talk about full year for a minute. Full year cash from operations actually shows reported down versus 2005. If you look at the working capital, it was a source of cash in 2005, and it was a use of cash in 2006. The swing was about $900 million to $1 billion.  That big use of cash from working capital in 2006 was really coming from three specific items. One was the cash taxes paid on repatriation of foreign earnings from '05 that we paid the taxes in '06. There was a piece where we funded a couple hundred million dollars into a VEBA for employee benefit plans, and it allowed us to accelerate some tax deductions. Then there was $100 million donation in the fourth quarter to the Coca-Cola Foundation.  Those items actually were discrete items, if you will. If you eliminated those you would see that '06 cash flow actually was a pretty good significant increase versus '05. I would expect to see '07 increase, if you will, off of a normalized '06 as well, and then off of a reported '06 I would expect cash flow to increase significantly. That may be too much detail. Does that answer the question? \n John Faucher - JP Morgan:  Yes, it does. Thanks. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch. \n Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch:  Thank you very much. A question on acquisitions, if I could. In '06 we saw acquisitions of Apollinaris and Multon in Russia. I'm wondering if you can put into perspective your recently acquired Latin America juice company, as well as Fuse beverage, and talk about perhaps the incremental expectations from acquisitions in '07 as well as the opportunities of what you see around the world in the categories that you seek to expand in? \n Neville Isdell:  Well, first of all, I just want to highlight technically, of course, we haven't closed the Mexican acquisition yet. There are regulatory pieces to go through, just to make that point. But, Christine, I've continually said that bolt-on acquisitions are the way that we are going to go, and we will be opportunistic about that. By the way, you could add the Traficante acquisition in Italy to that with regard to water in Europe, and I think you are going to see it in the juice and in the water arena primarily, water as a key platform.  Major acquisitions are very difficult from a regulatory standpoint given what they call the portfolio effect theory, certainly in the likes of Europe, so they are going to have to be bolt-on acquisitions. Again, when you come to water, because primarily we are talking sourced water, sourced water by its own nature is geographically specific. Therefore, there will be country by country, which is what you have seen. We'll continue to look at juice, as I say. Although we have nothing major in the pipeline at the moment, it's probably going to be around the same sort of level in '07 as '06, as we reinforce our business in key countries.  Our bottlers are now aligned with us in terms of a model that works. Muhtar, I don't know if you'd like to comment on that, because I think that's a very important piece going forward, particularly where we are with the likes of CCHBC and with FEMSA. \n Muhtar Kent : I just want to add that essentially what we are not doing certainly in any way or form trying to replace organic growth with our acquisitions. What we focus on religiously is organic growth, and wherever there's an opportunity we will have a bolt-on acquisition where you will see us doing those in harmony and in complete collaboration with our bottling partners. That's the key principle going forward.  On the models, certainly you will see us testing models that really work and enhance our relationship in those categories that actually lend themselves to those models with our bottlers. Juice certainly is one of those. You will see those models emerging as we move into 2007. \n Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch:  That's great. Thank you. Just as a clarification, how much did the warehouse water decline hurt your North American volumes in the quarter? \n Gary Fayard:  About 1%. or less than 1%. \n Muhtar Kent : The first half of 2007 will still be impacted by that, but as we will transition out of that into the second half of 2007. \n Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch:  Great. Thanks a lot. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of Carlos Laboy - Bear Stearns. \n Carlos Laboy - Bear Stearns:  Good morning. Muhtar, last quarter you indicated on this call that traditional methods of charging for non-carbs were not applicable, and that more comprehensive partnerships were needed. With the U.S. now under your belt, does your view of comprehensive partnerships also stand for the U.S.? \n Muhtar Kent :  The critical piece here, Carlos, is to ensure that we have an equitable model in our franchise relationship that we see for whatever category we are talking about, the common vision, and we have transparency on how we share the value. I think that's the key piece.  Emerging out of that, then, will be maybe some new models where applicable. I can't tell you specifically how that that will evolve in North America right now. All I can tell you is that certainly you will see examples of this emerging around the world that will benefit and that will be beneficial both to us and our bottling partners, on a win-win basis. \n Carlos Laboy - Bear Stearns:  Thank you. \n Neville Isdell:  Carlos, just to add to that, don't forget, you've got a different structure in North America in terms of what we used to call fountain food service. So that actually changes the way that you go to market with some of that. Also, if you look at what we're doing with Fuse, what we've done with Odwalla, we see Fuse, of course, it goes to 20 bottlers already, expanding through the bottler system, but we're going to manage that as a discrete unit in order to be able to keep the entrepreneurial capacities of those people available to us. Again, that fits in entirely with what Muhtar is saying as we move in a way sometimes even experimental models in order to move the business forward. \n Carlos Laboy - Bear Stearns:  Thanks. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of Robert van Brugge - Sanford Bernstein. \n Robert van Brugge - Sanford Bernstein: A question about Latin America. It seems to have driven about half of your operating profit growth in 2006 and a lot of it came from especially strong price mix. Could you maybe comment on the sources of where the price mix is coming from and as to what extent that's sustainable in 2007 and beyond? \n Muhtar Kent :  Robert, good morning. I do not think that there's anything very specific. It's much more wide-based, and it's not only a question of price, but also our ability to execute with our customers in terms of revenue growth management and all the systems that we have got in place and the information that we are using in order to ensure that we leverage the right execution daily, all the way from the south of the continent to the north. You will see that there's some mix in packaging, and IC as we continue to invest heavily in cold drink, and continue to leverage the first moment of truth in all our customers across Latin America. \n Robert van Brugge - Sanford Bernstein:  And next year, or in 2007 ? \n Muhtar Kent :  I expect that you wouldn't see anything different from what we have been doing in '05 and '06. \n Neville Isdell:  But, Robert, you will see the right execution daily. You will see RGM rolling out and the benefits of that in terms of the value equation in the rest of the world as well as we move forward. I have talked about innovation not just being product and package but being much more wide ranging. This is part of what we believe is real innovation and is strategic advantage. You have seen it working in Latin America, and we will roll it out elsewhere. It is also part, if you listened to my prepared remarks, I kept using the word value -- value opportunities. So it is that mix, and we have got that mix very well balanced in Latin America, and we'll continue to do that there but also to roll it out around the rest of the world. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS. \n Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: In some of these key growth regions, particularly Russia and China, can you talk about how much your growth is coming from ready to drink gaining share from the entire beverage category versus yourselves gaining share versus other branded companies? \n Muhtar Kent : I think it's a mix of both. There's certainly a Fuse opportunity, particularly in a place like China as urbanization takes foot. There's a conversion factor that benefits us certainly, because the current ready-to-drink component of total beverage consumption is still very low, in the 30s, 30%; in Russia it's slightly higher but there's also a significant conversion happening there. But also from other beverages as society changes, less consumption of alcoholic beverages also taking place in Russia. But then in addition to that, of course, we're certainly gaining share also in those markets in the current ready-to-drink category, too. \n Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS:  Thank you. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs. \n Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: One segment where you didn't gain share globally last year was ready-to-drink coffee and tea, and I guess some of that is because of the weakness in Georgia Coffee in Japan. Can you also talk about just broadly what you're doing to improve your performance in that segment especially in markets like North America where you have been lagging competition? \n Muhtar Kent :  Certainly we see that as a key opportunity going forward. You have seen Gold Peak, you have heard about Caribou in North America but across the world I would just say that certainly that's an area of opportunity for us, and you will see us being focused in that ready-to-drink tea, which is a much bigger segment, but also ready to drink coffee, which is a high-value segment. Godiva you have heard about in the United States, and you will see us certainly, as you rightly also said, that part of the weakness was from in the initial part of the year, particularly from Georgia coffee.  You see the six core Georgia products in the quarter that we have just left behind accounting for more than half of the total segment double-digits in Japan. So certainly as we ramp up our efforts in Japan, as well as across the world in both ready-to-drink coffee and also under the Nestea trademark, with our partnership with Nestle you will see us capturing some of those opportunities across the world both in Europe, Asia, as well as North America. \n Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs:  But is this really more of a multiyear opportunity in terms of having more impactful presence in that segment? \n Muhtar Kent :  It's certainly not a single-year opportunity. It is long-term. You will see us looking at the entire category of tea as a carrier for functional benefits also, but also certainly expanding our footprint in ready to drink coffee across the world is an important opportunity. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of Matt Riley - Morningstar. \n Matt Riley - Morningstar:  Good morning. I was hoping you might be able to provide a bit more background regarding what's gone right in Germany as far as stabilization of the market is concerned, and what learnings might be applicable to other struggling operations where a bottler consolidation is an option. \n Muhtar Kent : Germany certainly after a number of years of struggling, you have seen us returning good volume results in Germany. There's been a very successful launch of certainly Coke Zero, very, very good benefits that we have been able to extract from the World Cup activation in Germany, focus on immediate consumption and revenue growth management, so we're actually capturing more value than volume but also looking at capturing volume as we move forward and the new bottler management there, we haven't been focused on execution. So as we move forward as we fully integrate our total German system, you will see us leveraging that opportunity and the whole system is working together very effectively in Germany as we move into the full year of 2007. \n Neville Isdell:  I want to add to that because obviously I have lived in Germany for awhile and have worked through this whole issue with the bottlers, I referred to this earlier in terms of franchise leadership. Taking the tough decision to restructure that business and you get obviously for a period of time a situation where you are not firing on all cylinders in the marketplace. But was the right thing to do for the long term. We are willing to take that short term pain. That's what you have seen.  Now what you have seen is that even though we haven't quite finalized the formal agreements, that the system has now recognized that the one bottler system is the way to go, they have seen the cost benefits, because we're a very high cost system that will allow us to be much more competitive, and therefore, we're actually working as if that whole one bottle system had actually come into being. So this is what franchise leadership is all about, this is what modernizing our system is all about. And this is where we manage then to work together to move effectively into the marketplace. I go back to earlier comments that Muhtar made. When the system gets together, as they are now in Germany, as they now are in the United States, we are unbeatable.  Thank you very much. We have come to the end, and I'd like to thank each of you for joining us this morning. We clearly have a solid 2006 in the books, and 2007 is underway with our organization more than ever engaged in driving innovation, in improving our speed to market, and maintaining our outward focus on our consumers, our customers, our bottling partners, and our broader community.  I'm confident that our strategies are working, and that our actions are going to create long-term sustainable growth and value for our shareholders. That is what we are all focused on, and that is what we will work hard to do, Muhtar and I, Gary, the rest of the team, every single day. Thank you very much. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Coca-Cola Company's fourth quarter 2006 earnings results conference call.

(Operator Instructions) I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors and therefore questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's media relations department if they have questions. I would now like to introduce Ann Taylor, Vice President and Director of Investor Relations.\nAnn Taylor: Good morning and thank you for being with us today. I am pleased to be joined by Neville Isdell, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Gary Fayard, our CFO; Muhtar Kent, President of our International Operations; and Sandy Douglas, President of our North America Operating Group. Following prepared remarks by Neville and Gary this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions.  Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this call may contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning long-term earning objectives and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent SEC report.  In addition, I would also like to call your attention to the fact that we have posted schedules on our company's website at www.thecocacolacompany.com in the investor section, which reconcile our results as reported under GAAP to certain non-GAAP measures, which may be referred to by senior executives in our discussion this morning, and from time to time in discussing our financial performance. Please look on our website for this information. Now let me turn the call over to Neville.\nNeville Isdell: Thank you, Ann and good morning, everyone. As usual I'm just going to make a few observations about the quarterly results and then Gary's going to follow with his overview of financials and some additional perspective on 2006 which should, we believe, give you plenty of time for your questions.  I'm pleased to report that we delivered another solid quarter. In the quarter, top line volume growth of 5% resulted in ongoing operating income growth of 8%, including a slight currency benefit. Our performance was driven by balanced growth across our international geographies; a continued, system-wide focus on execution; and of course, on innovation and effective marketing programs that are increasingly connecting with our consumers.  On a year-to-date basis then, ongoing currency neutral; operating income increased 7% and ongoing EPS grew 8%; both within our long-term growth model. That was even as we continued to make solid investments in our marketing.  From a top line perspective, I'm particularly pleased with three important factors: First we again demonstrated our ability to deliver consistent volume growth on a year-over-year basis. We cycled 5% growth in the prior year, something that I know you've all raised as an issue. Can we cycle the third quarter of last year? Our two-year run rate continues to be ahead of our long-term growth target.  Second, we achieved balanced growth across categories with 5% growth in carbonated beverages, our highest growth rate for carbonated beverages in more than five years; and 5% growth in noncarbonated beverages. Trademark Coca-Cola grew 3%, accelerating on the 2% growth in the prior year. Sprite delivered 11% international growth and 6% worldwide; and Fanta grew 7%. As a result, these core brands contributed more than half of the growth in the quarter. We gained share in carbonated soft drinks globally.  In noncarbonated beverages, we continue to expand our presence, cycling strong double-digit growth in the prior year with solid performance in water, ready-to-drink juice, and sports drinks. However, we are not satisfied with our share performance in noncarbs. Expanding our presence in ready-to-drink tea and coffee continue as a significant opportunity, and neither we nor Nestle are happy with the progress that we've made in this area. Now you're starting to see signs of progress, including the recent relaunch of Nestea in the U.S.; the introductions of Enviga and Gold Peak in North America, but there's clearly more that we can do.  Finally, our results continue to benefit from the geographic diversity of our business. Our international operations delivered 7% growth as four of our five international groups achieved mid single-digit or better volume growth. The quarter was led by strong volume growth in key emerging markets in Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, and many parts of Asia and Africa even as they lapped solid results in the prior year.  Volume increased 11% in markets with per capita consumption less than 150. It's a statistic I love giving to you because this is where a great deal of our long-term growth comes from. Now these results more than offset the volume declines in the Philippines, in Japan, and North America.  In addition, and equally encouraging, is the strength of some of our more developed markets. I'd like to just take a moment now to highlight two groups that I'm particularly encouraged by. In Latin America, we delivered another outstanding quarter. Strong core brands, marketing programs, World Cup included. The focus on noncarb opportunities and world-class execution led to 7% volume growth, lapping a prior year growth rate of 5%. In Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina, trademarks Coke, Sprite, and Fanta grew 7%, 9% and 10% respectively as we gained carbonated soft drink share in Latin America.  We gained traction with noncarbonated beverages in many markets. Noncarbonated beverages in Latin America grew double digits and represented over 20% of the company's total noncarb growth for the quarter.  Secondly, I continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Europe where volume grew 10% in the quarter. Now, we clearly did benefit from favorable weather for most of the quarter. We also are delivering on the strategies and the priorities outlined on our earnings call a year ago, and we are gaining momentum.  Spain and Central Europe continued their solid performance and our actions in Northwest Europe and Germany gained traction. The performance is a result of strong execution of our key marketing programs in alignment with our partners as we drove growth in CSDs and accelerated our position in noncarbs. Europe successfully activated our World Cup marketing program, as in fact did over 100 markets globally. As the World Cup closed, we started launching Coca-Cola Zero in Great Britain, Germany and Spain.  For Coke share in Britain, early results were really positive. Let me just give you some data. Growing household and impulse penetration in the 16 weeks since the launch has resulted in our share of colas increasing by over 3 percentage points versus the prior year, and our primary competitor\u2019s share fell by almost 3 percentage points. In other words, a 6 percentage point swing. Strong repeat purchase and lower than expected cannibalization demonstrates to us that our innovative three cola strategy will be successful in these markets. Therefore, in addition, we're going to be launching Coca-Cola Zero in Belgium and Nordics during the fourth quarter, something that we had not originally budgeted.  Europe has also made good progress in expanding beyond carbonated soft drinks. While they only account for 13% of the growth volume, non-CSDs contributed 51% of total volume growth.  We completed two strategic acquisitions in the quarter. The Apollinaris source water brand in Germany, Queen of Table Waters, and the Traficante source waters in Italy. Now that combined added 3 points of growth to the quarter, so organically there was a 7% growth. Additionally, we continue to innovate and expand the presence of our Aquarius, POWERADE and Burn trademarks across the group. So you can see that we are continuing to turn the corner in Europe.  So now let me discuss what are probably going to be your two top questions: performance in Japan and North America. We've started the recovery process in Japan and we've delivered on our commitment of sequential volume growth improvement versus the second quarter. Weakness in core brands and softness in the overall soft drink category continued to impact our results. Now while our overall share continued to decline, we did gain share in carbonated soft drinks and importantly, in ready-to-drink coffee.  The Georgia Coffee re-launch continued to be on track resulting in a slight volume improvement versus the prior quarter and a gain in category share. The new marketing campaign has been well received as our consumer tracking shows improvements in brand awareness, ad awareness, and purchase intent. Additionally just one small proof point, but the TV spot supporting the campaign was recognized by independent consumer research as the top spot in Japan in August.  In the fourth quarter, we're going to have new flavor launches under Fanta and Georgia Coffee including a core promotional campaign. Under Trademark Coca-Cola, we're going to continue to focus on Diet Coke. We introduced Cherry Coke during the holiday season as well as Coca-Cola promotional efforts in focused key channels to maximize home consumption during the winter season.  The Japan team is aggressively addressing the issues and is focused on executing their strategies required to drive the long-term health of the business. I'd like to reiterate that we continue sequential improvement and we will see that in the fourth quarter, though the results will remain weak.  Let\u2019s turn now to North America. While there was certainly positives in the quarter, overall, once again, I'm not satisfied with our performance. North American unit case volume was down 1% in the quarter, lapping a 3% growth in the prior year. Volume results were certainly impacted by a weakening of the CSD category in September and by several strategic choices that we made to improve long-term profitability.  Let me take the positive side first. We continue leadership in carbonated soft drinks and we actually gained share in what is, as you all know, a challenging environment. Of course, the near term cost environment is also likely to put pressure on category volumes as we go forward. However, being consistent on this, we continue to see significant opportunity in carbonated beverages, as broadly defined. This is going to require us to continually innovate and redefine carbonated beverages and deliver the right level of execution.  We also began to refocus our resources behind the more profitable Dasani business. So if you exclude the impact of warehoused water, North America unit case growth would have actually been flat with the prior quarter. Now, there was a volume impact of that on the water side, but actually there was a minimal profit impact as we moved to more profitable Dasani. In juices, we also announced our third price increase in our premium chilled orange juice to offset what are significant cost increases in cost increases in orange juice solids. Volume was obviously negatively impacted. What we're doing here is continuing to take actions to enhance the value proposition of juices to our consumers. It's important to note, though, that we gained volume and value share in the quarter. That was driven by strong performance in the premium trademark, Simply, and the products under that trademark.  Therefore, we continue to focus on profitability, accelerating our presence in noncarbonated beverage categories with particular focus on the tea category at the moment, and you will see that again in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, that includes the relaunch and repackaging of Nestea and the introduction of Gold Peak, our premium brewed tea. Trademark POWERADE grew in mid single-digits and that was cycling over 30% growth in the prior year.  Now while I'm not satisfied with the quarter in North America, Sandy in his first 30 days on the job has been focused on assessing our brand, category, and customer marketing, plus working with our bottling partners to focus efforts on capturing the opportunities that we believe are there for long-term growth and profit for the system. Sandy's long experience and successful experience in North America and his leadership of our customer organization globally, in my view, make him uniquely qualified to drive our efforts forward and we have seen a seamless transition from Don to Sandy.  In summary overall, I'm very pleased with our top and bottom line performance. We continue to effectively manage our portfolio of brands and our portfolio of countries to deliver results in line with our growth targets. I'm confident we're taking the necessary actions to create sustainable growth and value for the benefits of our shareholders and other stakeholders. Now let me just turn you over to Gary. \n Gary Fayard : Thanks, Neville and good morning. As you saw on the release, we reported earnings per share of $0.62 in the quarter, an increase of 15% on a year-to-date basis; reported earnings per share of $1.87, which represents an increase of 12%. Our quarterly results included a couple of items that impacted comparability that essentially offset each other in the quarter. We had some charges related to asset impairment and restructuring which were primarily offset by the benefits that we had from a reversal of a tax valuation allowance. Therefore, there's no difference between reported and adjusted or comparable earnings per share for the quarter.  After considering items impacting comparability in both years, EPS increased 9% in the quarter and 8% year-to-date. In addition, we have lowered our expected underlying effective tax rate on operations for 2006 and for 2007 to 23.5% or 24%, which provided a $0.01 per share of benefit in the quarter, and I'll touch more on that in a minute.  At the net revenue line for the quarter, we reported revenues up 7% versus the prior year; there were a few items that specifically impacted that number. Structural change negatively impacted revenues by 2%, primarily due to the transfer in Spain of canning rights to the bottlers, and we've discussed that in the past. As a reminder, there's no profit impact from that change. So excluding structural changes, revenues in the quarter grew 9%.  Pricing and mix was 4%, driven by a solid pricing environment across many of our key environments, in particular Latin America; and improved performance in our bottling investment group.  We grew operating income by 11% on a reported basis for the third quarter. We also had some items impacting comparability in the current and prior-year quarter. So after considering these impacts, operating income increased 8%, which included a slight positive impact from currency.  SG&A increased 12% in the quarter, which is higher than our run rate in the first half of the year. So let me take a minute to walk you through what contributed to that increase. About half of the increase is due to structural change in acquisitions, the cycling of lower expenses in the prior year and currency, each of those contributing about two points to the growth.  First, as expected, we saw higher expenses in the bottling investments group, including the impact of acquisitions as we continue to invest behind sales and service. Second, we cycled lower stock option expense and some various small gains on sales of land in the prior year. Lastly, currency increased SG&A by 2%. Driving a significant portion of the remaining growth was continued solid investment behind our core operations, as marketing expenses grew at a rate similar to our top line.  Now with regard to cash flow in the quarter, you will see a decline in cash from operations driven by an increase in working capital on a year-over-year basis. This is caused by the same key items that we discussed in the first two quarters, which we relate to settlement of marketing accruals and timing of marketing payments and cash tax payments related to repatriation of foreign earnings from last year. As you'll see, these relate to timing of expenses rather than changes in the fundamental working capital structure of our operations.  Let me address a couple other factors that we see impacting our outlook for the remainder of this year. During the second quarter earnings call, we stated that there was a $0.02 per share of benefit from gallons timing that we received in the quarter and that benefit would reverse in the second half of 2006. We see $0.01 of that gallons timing reversing in the third quarter and expect the additional $0.01 to reverse in the fourth quarter.  On share repurchase, as a result of the number of recent and potential acquisition activities, we were conservative and refrained from actively repurchasing shares during the majority of the quarter. We currently intend that our range of share repurchase in 2006 will remain between $2 billion and $2.5 billion.  For input costs, we continue to see upward pressure, but we are actively managing those pressures.  Now on taxes, I mentioned earlier we anticipate that our underlying effective tax rate for the full year of 2006 and 2007 will be approximately 23.5%. The tax rate for the quarter was slightly lower than this revised underlying effective rate due to two reasons.  One, there's a catch up to bringing the effective tax rate for the first nine months in line with our new, lower, full-year estimate. Recall that we had previously anticipated and applied an underlying effective tax rate of 24% through the first half of 2006.  Secondly, we have a one-time net tax benefit of approximately $41 million, due primarily to a reduction of a valuation allowance on our U.S. capital loss carryforwards. This is associated with our fulfillment of a 2003 agreement with Femsa which allows them to regain a majority ownership in Coca-Cola Femsa as they were diluted to a minority stake as a result of the Pan Amco acquisition. The planned sale, which will impact the fourth quarter, will result in a gain and on that gain -- as opposed to what some other companies would want you to do -- I would suggest that you treat it as a nonrecurring item and exclude it from ongoing earnings.  Now let me move to currency. On a comparable basis, currency has had only a slight positive impact on our operating income for the quarter. Year-to-date has been a 1% drag. We have put coverage in place and are effectively covered through the fourth quarter of 2006 on most key currencies, but based on current spot rates and the expected impact of the coverage in place, we expect currencies to have a slight negative impact to operating income in the fourth quarter and a 1% negative impact for the full year of 2006, and that includes the impact of the first nine months. This is slightly more pessimistic on the impact in the fourth quarter than I gave you at the last earnings call, as the yen and the rand remain weak.  In closing, and as we outlined in the release, with the progress to-date and the pipeline we have in place, we believe that we are taking the necessary actions to create long-term sustainable growth and value for our shareholders.  That's it for the topics I wanted to cover this morning. Neville, Muhtar, Sandy, and I are now ready for your questions. \nOperator: Your first question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicholas. \n Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicholas: Good morning, everyone. Gary or Neville, simply a fact question for you: year-to-date marketing spend, if you look at that on a per case basis, can you give us the rate of growth there? \n Gary Fayard : Yes, Mark, it is 10%. \n Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicholas: 10% on a per case? \n Gary Fayard : I'm sorry, per case, no. Year-over-year, it is about 10%. \n Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicholas: Okay and then we can adjust for the cases? \n Gary Fayard : You can adjust it for the cases. \nNeville Isdell: I think, as I said in my earlier remarks, Mark, we believe we are getting traction out of the spend. I think if you want to go back to really the question about the $400 million, I think you see it certainly in the international results, as to how that is now working for us. Again, you see that positively on the revenue line, so marketing is essentially up at the same level as revenue overall. \n Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicholas: Yes. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Lauren Torres - HSBC. \n Lauren Torres \u2013 HSBC: Good morning. Two markets that you really didn't touch upon were India and the Philippines. I was hoping you could just give us an update for what you are seeing there, if we see improvements, structurally any changes, anything you can add there would be great.\nNeville Isdell: Muhtar do you want to have that?\n Muhtar Kent: Good morning. On India, despite the issues around the Pepsi size issue, we grew our unit cases in India 4% in the quarter, and that was actually the first growth we have had in India for the last eight quarters consecutively, despite all the issues around that matter. I think we are still cautious about our results in India. But we are working our programs, imaging programs in India and marketing programs are really working. I think you can see that from the results.  As far as the Philippines is concerned, we are still in discussions with our partner and we basically see the business continue to be challenged at the moment. We are working very hard to try to resolve the issues with our partner. \n Lauren Torres \u2013 HSBC: Do you have a timeline as far as discussions are concerned? \n Muhtar Kent: As soon as feasible. \n Lauren Torres \u2013 HSBC: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Spillane - Banc of America. \n Brian Spillane - Banc of America: Good morning, just a question on new products. What contribution to your volume growth rate in the quarter came from new products introduced this year? \nNeville Isdell: I actually don't have that one right off the top. We are going to have to come back to you. It varies obviously by geography where we have put those new products, in you would see all of the growth that's in Australia would have come out of new products. You would see a major amount of the turnaround in the U.K. out of new products.  We have also, of course, got acquisitions in there; that would be about seven-tenths of 1%. We actually don't break that out normally in terms of giving that breakout. Let me just go back. If you look at core brand Coca-Cola, if you look at what you call here Coca-Cola Classic, you are looking at a 3% growth off that base.  I've always said, job one is to regenerate growth with the brands that we have and that we would be able to do that. While that's not true across every geography, and I've referred to some of the geographic splits, we have proven to be able to do that. So that is against the marketing, that's against the new campaign. That's against bringing in the increased intellectual capital with better people, et cetera. You see it with Fanta and you see it with Sprite. Within that, of course there are some new flavors, et cetera.  But the innovation is not, at this point in time, the key driver. That is still down the line. I think that's 07/08 as you see that coming, you see the early pieces of that, as I mentioned with tea in North America as you look at Gold Peak, the relaunch of Nestea, you see the launch of Enviga. You know, it is the tip of the iceberg now coming through.  So we are maintaining our ongoing volume targets but I think the encouraging thing is that job one is working pretty well, which is the reinvestment behind the core and the growth of that. Now, does that not mean that there is not a pipeline of launches out there? No. I mean, you have seen the innovation around the Odwalla trademark, you have seem the extension of the Simply brand in juice; you have seen what we have done with Godiva and of course the other brands that I've mentioned. So there is a lot going out there. We are running out Aquarius across Europe after great success if in Spain. I mentioned Burn in my early remarks across Europe. That is not high volume metrically but it\u2019s high from a profit standpoint. So that mix is taking place.  Again, when we talk about innovation, I want to look at it in two ways because some of the innovation is not going to show up on the volume charts. Burn would be a particular example, Full Throttle would be another example where you actually see it in terms of the overall margins and overall profitability. So some of these innovations are not a raw comparison of what's the percentage in volume terms, is probably not a good one and we certainly wouldn't want to give away the profit ones as well.  Sandy, I don't know if you want to say something about Vault and Energy in North America, but I think you are pretty encouraged with the early results on Vault. \n Sandy Douglas: Yes, Neville, I think the results with Vault particularly in immediate consumption have been very strong and we continue to build momentum with that brand. Energy, year-to-date is growing share around Full Throttle, Tab Energy, and yet we have tremendous plans going forward for new products in the Energy area.  So you mentioned the momentum with Simply and Odwalla, and then of course the year-over-year momentum with Coke Zero where we still have a lot more to do in terms of marketing and executing Coke Zero, but as we lap the introduction we have good growth in the quarter of about 30%. \n Brian Spillane - Banc of America: So Neville, your progress on loading the new innovation pipeline, you feel like you are pretty much on track with what you laid out a year ago? \nNeville Isdell: Yes, I am. The proof point that we have with regard to that is what's in the pipeline. We have an innovation lab here which we bring customers into so that they can see what we are doing and what we are working on. It is part of this collaborative customer model that Sandy actually put in place in his old job. Where we involve our customers at an earlier stage in terms of what we are bringing down the pipeline on a confidential basis. They will agree to come. They will say, \u201cwell, we can spend an hour-and-a-half\u201d and they spend four hours. That's where we open up the window as to what's coming down the pipeline.  I would also refer to a day that we spent with our top to top bottlers about three weeks ago. Each of them as they went through the summaries said \u201cThis is the best medium that we have had. We are very encouraged with what you have coming down the pipeline.\u201d  The issue, of course, is that some of these innovations are value-added. Some of them along the line are going to involve health claims; that's going to need FDA approval. I said I'm here for the long term. I'm managing for the long term. So some of these are out in '08 and '09. This is not something where we can get instant gratification, I'm afraid. But I'm confident that the pipeline is being built the way that I outlined it. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Marc Greenberg - Deutsche Bank. \n Marc Greenberg - Deutsche Bank: Thanks, good morning. My question relates to Japan. I'm hoping you might be able to offer some insights with regards to the system and portfolio capabilities; ability to offset any risk that you see in change in consumer buying patterns? In other words, have you thought about whether or not the consumer has fundamentally shifted away from ready-to-drink coffee, given the ongoing category weakness? And what impact growth in Starbucks and the like are having on that important profit business for Coke? \n Muhtar Kent: I'll just try to reflect on that. We think that there is a totally different consumer that is actually going after the Starbucks-type, the chilled cup coffee versus the canned coffee that is a very, very different business that is driven by vending and driven by a different kind of consumer. The profiles of the consumers are different. While that doesn't mean that there is not a going to be future success for that Starbucks-type chilled cup coffee, of which there are many other products out in the marketplace and is a growing segment. But we feel that there is certainly a very different consumer, and also as far as that segment, the canned coffee segment is concerned you are talking about roughly 8 million to 10 million transactions per day which currently is done through convenience stores, done through vending machines, primarily. So we don't see that that is something necessarily that we will take away but it will be complementary. That's how we see it.  That doesn't mean that there is no opportunities and we are certainly looking at that opportunity very, very seriously in terms of what that can give to our business also going into the future. But we don't see that as a threat to that very large canned coffee market in Japan. \nNeville Isdell: I think the results that we outlined, just broadly, in terms of the growth that we are getting back into Georgia underpin that. Let me talk broadly about the coffee category. We think there are exciting margin opportunities there. That is obviously what's happening with regard to Starbucks. You see us with our tests with Far Coast in Canada, very early days. We are exploring; this is again not going to show up on the charts in a hurry.  That gives us new ways to test, new ways to test flavors in different markets, flavor combinations with coffee. You will see that rolling out now in Norway, Singapore, et cetera.  Again, if we go back to the earlier question about innovation that's an area where we are innovating and we think that chilled coffee in Japan, through the convenience channel, is going to be an additional opportunity for us, but without obsoleting the existing pack and the existing formulations that we have. Again, to be repetitive, but I think it is important to say this: that turnaround is very much on track. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch. \n Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much. Good morning A question for Neville or Sandy. Looking at North America, with revenues up 4% and profits down 7% and given your discussion about the focus on more profitable water, can you just talk through a little bit about how your mix was negative, if warehouse volumes water were down? Talk a little bit about the magnitude of the input costs in the quarter. In perspective, what drove the 4% favorable price mix on a global basis when country mix seems still a bit negative? Thank you. \nNeville Isdell: I think there is a global question here. Gary, why don't you start with that? \n Gary Fayard : Yes, there are a couple of things that I would say. Let me start with North America. If you look at year-to-date, North America has actually had a very good year-to-date. You see that gallons were actually ahead of cases in the first half of the year, which we highlighted in the second quarter call. That started reversing in the third quarter and that's what you are actually seeing a lot of what happened at a high level in North America. Where gallons were actually down two in the quarter.  We do have higher input costs. We are managing that. We are optimistic, particularly because where we have got the premium high end of the market, particularly in juice where there's been a lot of pressure on input costs; where we have got the Simply trademark and Odwalla, we have actually continued to see growth there and really, offsetting the input costs. So while there is pressure there, I think we are effectively managing that.  Lastly on North America, we purposely and have actually planned all along in this quarter to start changing out some of our water plants and switching those over to the Dasani brand, which drives higher profitability. It had an impact on volumes, but very little impact on profit for the quarter.  If I look then globally at what happened, price mix as I said, if you go to revenue, revenue was 9% comparable without structural change. Price mix up at 9% was actually 4 points. Of that bottling investments group, while their margin percentages are lower and it can have some impact on the margin, bottling investments actually contributed 2 points of that 4-point price mix growth. That's where we are seeing significant improvement from the bottlers, the CBOs that we own.  I'm happy that we also got 2 points of pricing in the core business as well which is in line with what we have said our long-term earnings model is. And we are getting that, if you look at the mix of our volume in the quarter, you had Latin America obviously doing very well, but you also had very good volume results and profit results coming from Europe, which is high profit market. Therefore, overall results were very good. \n Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: That really makes sense globally. Just touching on North America, the negative product mix was driven by water, even though the wholesale volumes were down? \n Gary Fayard : Yes. \n Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Robert Van Brugge \u2013 Sanford Bernstein. \n Robert Van Brugge \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: Yes, good morning. Question for Gary. It looks like you spent about $500 million on the acquisitions in the quarter. Did that have any impact on the operating profit growth numbers? \n Gary Fayard : Robert, very little, a negligible impact. It obviously did on volumes, but in this quarter negligible impact on operating income. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Carlos Laboy - Bear Stearns. \n Carlos Laboy - Bear Stearns: Good morning. Can you speak to progress and challenges for reaching noncarb deals in Latin America? And specifically, do incidence rates work for noncarbs, and why or why not? \n Muhtar Kent: Can you repeat the second part of your question? \n Carlos Laboy - Bear Stearns: Can you speak to progress and challenges for reaching noncarb deals in Latin America, and do incidence rates work for noncarbs; why or why not? \n Muhtar Kent: Yes. First let me say this. As far as noncarb deals in Latin America, it is clearly growing, having a balanced growth both driving our CSD portfolio as well as looking at every opportunity in the nonalcoholic beverage category in noncarbs is clearly our priority in Latin America. So if we see opportunities in Latin America that work for us on a regional basis, on a country basis we will certainly go after them. Therefore we look upon the whole area of opportunities across Latin America in noncarbs in both driving them organically, but also any other acquisitions that could work for us on a country-by-country basis.  Now as far as the noncarb business model is concerned, we are in discussions with our bottling partners in Latin America to reach a mutual win/win model, a business model that works, that drives volume and sustains profitability across Latin America for noncarbs. I was just down there last week meeting with all our Latin American bottlers and I'm very excited with the opportunities in that area. \n Carlos Laboy - Bear Stearns: But specifically with regard to incidence, Muhtar?  I believe that you need a more all encompassing business model around noncarbs that works, that drives a win-win model for both us and our bottling partners. I'm very excited by the prospects of that. I want to add that we reached a forward-looking agreement that demonstrates our solid and constructive relationship with our bottling partner Femsa. This agreement underscores our mutual understanding for value creation alternatives from a potentially larger revenue pool. I'm very happy to note that both our companies are aware of the growth opportunities, agree on the growth opportunities that exist in the carbs as well as noncarbs business. We will pursue these opportunities to fulfill our growth objectives for both of our shareholders. So I'm excited by that prospect also. I just want to say this at this moment, Carlos. \nNeville Isdell: Carlos, obviously we are somewhat inhibited in that FEMSA will have to make their results announcements, but I encourage you to follow up with FEMSA and I think you will get some more granularity. This is of course across Latin America, but I think you will get some more granularity with regard to the agreements we have and how we are going to move forward very effectively with them in the next couple of weeks. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Will Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley. \n Will Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley: Good morning, everyone. Can you talk about the cash flow impact looking out toward '07 from some of the bottling businesses that you have already announced you will be acquiring or you are in the works of, in terms of the cash to acquire as well as the capital required to run the business -- say China, Philippines, Philadelphia. You also have the $1 billion payment to Germany early next year. What are the cash flow impacts, any impact you see on the repo program looking out to '07 as a result of any of that? \n Gary Fayard : Relative to the acquisitions, let me categorize those as carry beverages in China, Philadelphia and Germany. While we and [Sam McGill] have made some references in the Philippines to having some discussions, there are no definitive agreements there so I really cannot comment on at that.  First on Philadelphia, we actually have entered into a put call arrangement which is two years out, so there will be no impact on cash flow or capital for 2007. If you look, though, at Apollinaris Germany, the acquisition of Apollinaris, the acquisition of Traficante in Italy, the German bottling system and the put call arrangement there, as well as the letter of intent with the other bottlers, as well as China; there will be some additional capital in 2007 from those. We do not see it as being significant. It will be maybe a few hundred million dollars. Let's call it $300 million or $400 million probably for those bottlers next year.  My expectation though is we had a significant ramp up in capital in North America for 2006. We see some of that declining and don't have to add as much capital to North America in 2007. So those will somewhat offset, so you will see some slight modest increase but I don't think it is going to be a material kind of increase. \n Will Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley: Gary, the couple hundred million is the actual CapEx involved in those bottling operations, but then taking into account the $1 billion payment and some of the acquisition costs as well? \n Gary Fayard : Right. Yes, we do have about $1 billion in Germany for the put call. In addition to that, while we have got a nonbinding letter agreement with the remaining independent bottlers in Germany, I think most of that will probably be on a merger versus a cash basis. So call it $1 billion plus a little, but not material. We factored that in, have significant cash flows, I think in line with what we have been seeing and there should not be any impact on our share repurchase program. \nNeville Isdell: Bill, while we are talking about bottlers let me just fire off that because that's the capital going forward. I just want to go back, because I think within the broad strategic intent of what I laid out nearly two-and-a-half years ago about what we wanted to do, one of the issues that was out there was, can The Coca-Cola Company run bottlers and run them effectively?  I created what I call euphemistically the hospital ward, as it were, for bottlers where we need to turn them around and brought in the capability. It is not just Ariel; underneath him we have brought in half a dozen very high quality operators. It is doing the basics as you know, I spent a lot of time on the bottling side as well; but it is doing just the basics which allow us to enhance the margins. You will see that as we have gone through year-to-date, we are talking about up 3. Therefore, whilst we are not going to retain them, I mean the whole idea of the hospital ward is we are going to fix them and move them out. You will see some of that happening as we go forward into '07. There is nothing that I can commit to at this stage but I think you will see some cash coming out of some disposals because we have got them fixed and more will come into that mix as we need to.  I think from a very broad strategic standpoint that's extremely important because now we have got the ability to turn around bottlers that are underperforming and do that successfully. That was something I know, and quite legitimately, I'm not pushing back hard on this, was a big, big question about, well historically you haven\u2019t run bottlers very well. What are you able to do? I think the proof points are coming in there as you look at those bottling investment numbers and therefore it has a very strong impact on what we are also able to do with regard to our overall base business; our core business in terms of concentrate sales. Because as we turn those around, therefore we have got higher performing bottlers out there.  The reason I've expanded it, I know you need to look at what the capital is needed to do that. But I think the capability, which is just as important, is something we are beginning to demonstrate. \n Will Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley: Neville, given you ever that increased confidence on the capability do you need to use anymore of the hospital ward that you refer to, say in North America where there are structural issues? \nNeville Isdell: Bill I would never comment on any part of the world but where the hospital ward may be. That's unfair to do that to anyone. Very largely, it actually comes from the bottlers themselves where they are unable to grow the business they have decided that they want to move out. I mean, it is interesting how this always evolves. It tends to be a business that is underperforming and the owners, say they have lost confidence in the ability to get a return on their capital and they sell to us because they have lost faith in the business. We have not lost faith in the business. We take it and we turn it around. We show that this is still a good business with business growth. In some instances -- the restructuring of Germany would be one -- we would take maybe an aggressive stance and bring about change. I don't take that off the table for some future actions, but by and large, it tends to be people who come to us and want to exit. We take it over and turn it around. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher - JP Morgan. \n John Faucher - JP Morgan: Yes, good morning everyone. It looks like you guys are trying to pull back on some of this low/no/negative profit bottled water that got added let\u2019s say probably four or five years ago. Can you walk us through some other regions where we might see a pull back on some of this low margin bottled water volume? Should this continue to be a little bit of a drag on at least volumes over the next couple of quarters if that is the case? Thanks. \nNeville Isdell: Basically, we have done most of it. I have talked about that with regard to a number of countries where we have underperformed in terms of pulling back; Indonesia was one, for example, parts of Europe were the other. There is obviously still some in North America and you will see some modest impacts that you are going to see there. That's going to go through probably to Q2 '07, first half of '07.  In terms of the, of the overall company, I don't think it is going to be a major number. We will highlight it obviously as you break out North America. You will see it within that. But again, as Gary pointed out to you in terms of the actions taken in the third quarter, whilst it has a volume metric impact, its impact on profitability is very limited. So we don't see that the moves we make in that area will in any way undermine our ability to meet our long-term growth targets for volume growth. \nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Matthew Reilly - Morningstar. \n Matthew Reilly \u2013 Morningstar: Good morning I would like to return to India for a moment. I was wondering if you think that the long-term potential of the carbonated soft drink category has been limited by the latest round of pesticide allegations and product bans? \n Muhtar Kent: I do not think so. I think that the per capita consumption of carbonated soft drinks in India is very, very low. I think that they have a great future in India. I think the issue we have dealt very effectively and continue to deal with effectively with the issue of pesticides and with allegations. We feel very confident about our programs in India around marketing, both on a local basis as well as across the whole country.  We see this only as a very short setback. We feel that our growth in the third quarter could have been higher than it actually was. But we feel that over the long term we see great, great potential for our total portfolio in India, both in the carbonated beverage space as well as in the non-carbs. \nNeville Isdell: You know, Muhtar and his team have, I'm sure -- don't want to put themselves in the position of being in any way self-congratulatory but if you look at the 4% growth we had in the quarter and obviously immediately after the pesticide issue hit again, when the CSE decided to use it -- as she admits -- for a broader issue of pesticides in the food chain in India, admitting they picked on carbonated soft drinks because that would get them headlines. You know, we had a major downturn for a few weeks. I think if you look at the 4%, you can see that we were prepared to handle it, we were prepared to go out there very rapidly, work with the government. You see the government statements, you have seen the judicial system work for us. I think you will see the consumers starting to read it for what it is. \nOperator: Your final question is a follow-up from the line of Marc Greenberg - Deutsche Bank. \nMarc Greenberg - Deutsche Bank: Thanks, good morning. Question relates to anything that you can offer with regard to the Coca-Cola systemwide procurement efforts. Wondering if you might be able to provide an update on how Coke is working with its bottlers to offset what appear to be higher input costs for both aluminum and high fructose corn syrup; and if at all that factors into your thinking for concentrate price increases in '07? \nNeville Isdell: Well, you are dealing with a complex mix. Let me just go to input costs overall and I think we have to include in that sugar. Sugar prices did move up to something in the order of a 15-year high. That is important with regard to most of the rest of the world, because we use sugar as opposed to high fructose, HFCS, high fructose corn syrup. You have seen those prices come down. Certainly in the markets where we import as a system, because you are talking about the systemic purchasing that we have, we have been able to take cover to be able to minimize those costs.  So it is a 25-year-high actually, in sugar prices but we have been through this one before. So that forward coverage which was taken out systemically for import markets, remember, because controlled price commodity is one piece. PT is another important piece, but we do not believe given the capacity -- although there is, there is some tightness in one of the input costs -- but with the capacity that won't have a major effect.  Aluminum, we have seen the price of alumina come down, the raw material. We have not seen the price of aluminum coming down. Part of that is actually, you know, the focus is on the trading of the London metal exchange. Trading and hedging has got a big effect on that.  So if you look at the raw material input we think sometime around the end of '06/beginning of '07 that the reality of the marketplace is going to come through and there will be some easing. It is a tough one to call.  So if you go back to the questions around what that is going to mean with pricing and overall pricing flexibility, that is a complex equation because to what degree are you able to get that price out of the marketplace? It is obviously something that we face on an equal basis with all of our competitors. Particularly with aluminum where most suppliers have declared force majeur and therefore that may well be reflected more in pricing with the consumer rather than affecting our ability to price concentrate.  We are going to take this on a quarter by quarter basis because we think, given the other dynamics within that, that's an important piece. \n Gary Fayard : Just a couple of other thoughts on that. We do have global procurement council made up of ourselves and all of our major bottlers and the main ingredients, those ingredients are packaging, are included under that procurement group and we are procuring on a global basis, so most of the ingredients and packaging materials that we are talking about, we are one of or perhaps the largest purchaser in the world. Therefore, that gives us some advantages in that and we are definitely working together as a global system on procurement.  The second piece as well is that as you look at different areas of the world, some of these commodity costs are in fact dollar-based, and because of that, different currencies will give you different impacts and different views on commodity costs. The pressures are not as great in some of the international markets because of that, as they are like the U.S. So we are managing it actively, and we will continue to keep you updated as we go quarter by quarter. \nNeville Isdell: I think before I just close just a broader comment. You know you are going to see more of this consolidation taking place in terms of managing input costs and using the strength of the system overall. I think I mentioned on the last call what we are working on with regard to IT, not just in terms of developing common platforms with our bottlers but being able, therefore, to cut costs in terms of overall IT development. That is just another initiative building off what Gary has said and that certainly is a major strategic thrust to enable us to actually capitalize on the size of the system something I think we have not done as well as we might.  Over time you will see that to see that mitigate the costs of our system overall because after all, we are the ones able to help our bottlers by leveraging the overall power of the system.  So I would like to thank each of you for joining us this morning. I would believe that with the results in this quarter and the plans that we have in place, that I am confident that the business is on a solid footing. I did not put in, but I really should have in my other comments that there will always be a bump in the road. Hopefully we never hit one, but on a quarterly by quarterly basis that's something that's always a reality, sometime down the road. We continue to focus on execution. It is critical on our part going forward. But again, I think our results to date do underline the fact that our execution is improving. Of course, I look forward to speaking to you all again on the fourth quarter call early next year to share our progress. Thanks very much indeed. \nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's Coca-Cola Company's third quarter 2006 earnings results conference call."}], "2008": [{"symbol": "KO", "quarter": 4, "year": 2007, "date": "2008-02-13 13:01:08", "content": "Executives: Ann Taylor - Vice President and Director of Investor Relations Neville Isdell - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent - President, Chief Operating Officer Gary P.

Morgan Carlos Laboy - Credit Suisse  Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch Justin Hott - Bear Stearns\nOperator: Good morning. My name is Jennifer and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s fourth quarter 2007 earnings results conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce Ann Taylor, Vice President and Director of Investor Relations. \nAnn Taylor: Good morning and thank you for being with us today. I am joined by Neville Isdell, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Muhtar Kent, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Gary Fayard, our Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions.  Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company\u2019s most recent SEC report.  In addition, I would also like to note that we have posted schedules on our company website at thecocacolacompany.com under the financial information tab in the investors section, which reconcile our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles to certain non-GAAP measures which may be referred to by our senior executives in our discussions this morning and from time to time in discussing our financial performance. Please look on our website for this information.  Now let me turn the call over to Neville.  \nNeville Isdell: Thank you, Ann and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to start this morning with a few brief observations about the results and also highlight some of our accomplishments for 2007. Muhtar will then provide details on operational performance and our priorities for the current year, followed by Gary\u2019s overview of the financials and some additional perspective on 2008.  Today we reported a very positive finish to 2007, with another solid quarter of business results, a strong 5% unit case volume growth and 12% ongoing EPS growth capped an excellent year for The Coca-Cola Company.  In the fourth quarter, all operating units reported volume growth despite tough comparisons in some key markets. We benefited from the diversity of our geographic reach and our breadth and also the breadth of our product portfolio.  We delivered consistent financial performance and achieved results ahead of our long-term growth model in each quarter of 2007. By successfully executing our clearly defined strategies, we achieved the following full year results: 6% unit case volume growth, led by our international operations up 8% and robust 4% sparkling and 12% still beverage growth; 20% net revenue growth -- even when you exclude the acquisition of bottlers, net revenue grew 12%; ongoing operating income growth of 14%; comparable earnings per share of 14%; and cash flow from operations up 20%.  Notably, this is our 11th consecutive quarter of delivering at least 4% volume growth. The strong top line performance is translating to bottom line results as we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable EPS.  In 2007, we sold over 1.2 billion incremental unit cases, 1 billion being organic, not acquisition related. What this actually means is that our consumers refresh themselves 1.5 billion times each day with one of our beverages. We\u2019re a company moving successfully by executing against a clear strategic growth agenda. Across the company and throughout the system, talented people are driving growth and developing a culture of innovation and also improving efficiency.  We realize the journey is long and we are by no means declaring victory but we can confidently say that we have a solid foundation upon which to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value for our shareholders.  In 2007, we put our manifesto for growth into action. In fact, we now call it the manifesto in action. We made commitments to strengthen our sparkling portfolio, to enhance our position in still beverages, to improve our capabilities in consumer marketing, customer leadership, and franchise leadership, and ensure that our business is sustainable.  I am pleased to report that we delivered against each one of these commitments and are well-positioned to do so again in 2008 and beyond.  Specifically, we strengthened our position in sparkling beverages with trademarks Coca-Cola, Sprite, and Fanta, all delivering solid unit case growth. In fact, overall we captured 72% of the global sparkling beverage industry growth for the year.  Trademark Coca-Cola continued to be the key driver, with Coca-Cola Zero driving expansion of the category and gaining share. Coca-Cola Zero is now in 55 countries and it has become our 12th billion-dollar brand. Moreover, we\u2019re executing against our three cola strategy with passionate and award-winning global marketing campaigns. This strategy has delivered the highest growth in trademark Coca-Cola since 1998.  As I\u2019ve discussed in the past, sparkling beverages are going to continue to be the backbone of our global growth in both developed and emerging markets. Through integrated marketing and connection of our brands to consumer passion points like the Olympics in 2008, American Idol, and Super Bowl, we are uniquely positioned to capture the highly profitable sparkling beverage opportunity.  We also enhanced and expanded our still beverage business through organic growth and targeted bolt-on acquisitions. The biggest headline was our acquisition of Glaceau and its vitamin water brand. The fast-growing premier active lifestyle beverage has now become our 13th billion-dollar brand.  The acquisition has changed the game in North America beverages and helped align the Coca-Cola system to invest behind a winning portfolio of brands.  Beyond that one headline is continued global success across categories. Trademark Minute Maid increased unit cases 5%, driven by the expansion of Minute Maid Pulpy in China and other emerging markets. We\u2019ve built a strong global juice position in all of the BRIC countries -- Brazil with Jugos del Valle and Suco Mais, Russia with the Multon brands, India with Maaza and now Minute Maid, and of course China, where Minute Maid Pulpy is the number one brand in key metro markets.  In sports drinks and water, we continue to look for the highest value opportunities and drive innovation through functional enhancements.  Additionally, we are starting to make progress in the ready-to-drink tea and coffee categories. While we are number one globally in both categories, we are continuing to innovate in-house as well as work with our global partners Nestle and [Nilli] to capture the opportunity in these fast-growing categories.  This solid performance across the portfolio resulted in our company growing faster than the industry and capturing close to a quarter of the 5.5 billion incremental non-alcoholic ready-to-drink unit cases sold in 2007. We gained non-alcoholic ready-to-drink volume and value share globally, driven by share increases in both sparkling and still beverages.  Our progress in consumer marketing and consumer leadership sparked new interest in our expanding portfolio among shoppers, retail customers, and our bottling partners. The Coke side of life, happiness factory the movie, and other award-winning marketing programs have reignited the energy and the optimism right at the core of our brands, and our bottling partners are investing behind the business and they are driving inspirational markets themselves at the point of sale. The combined efforts across the system are working and driving our winning performance every day in the marketplace.  Next, a commitment that\u2019s become a true passion for me. We recognize that we cannot have a sustainable business unless the communities that we serve are themselves sustainable.  Our commitments center around four key touch stones: water, where we announced our new global partnership with the World Wildlife Fund to conserve seven of the world\u2019s most important watersheds and to become water neutral in all our beverage production processes.  Packaging, where we see opportunities to turn today\u2019s waste products into valuable resources for the future. We announced a significant expansion of our U.S. recycling efforts by investing $60 million, including the building of the world\u2019s largest PET bottle to bottle recycling plant in South Carolina and just last night, we announced the long-term target to recycle or reuse 100% of our aluminum beverage cans which we sell in the U.S., which builds on our previously announced goal to recycle or reuse 100% of our PET plastic bottles.  Climate -- we\u2019re intensifying our efforts to reduce carbon emissions. For example, at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, we\u2019ll buy more than 5,000 climate friendly coolers and vending machines.  And finally, well-being -- we need all consumers to understand the equation of calories in and calories out. We provide a range of beverage choices for our consumers and believe they thrive at the nexus of refreshment and nutrition. They all play a role in a balance diet for all age groups.  Overall, I am pleased with our accomplishments and strong performance in the quarter and the year. We have put in place a strong foundation and remain confident in our outlook for 2008.  While we continue to monitor the weakness in the U.S. economy, we remain optimistic about the resiliency of our portfolio, particularly in the developing and emerging markets. Of course, our eyes are wide open and we\u2019ll continue to analyze and respond appropriately to both opportunities and challenges. We believe that we will continue to progress off this strong base.  Before I turn the call over to Muhtar, I\u2019d like to make a few comments about our announcement in December. As you know, we announced plans to begin a seamless transition of the CEO responsibilities to Muhtar effective July 1, 2008. This is something that I\u2019ve been engaged with the board on since my return in 2004. I\u2019ve always believed that effective succession must be planned early in the game and also must be one of the core imperatives of how you manage the company.  Having worked closely with Muhtar for nearly 20 years, I am confident that his combination of industry knowledge, operational excellence, strategic vision, and commitment to our people, which he has already demonstrated as President in 2008, will continue to take our company forward.  With that then, let me now turn the call over to Muhtar to provide the details on our operations. \nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Neville and good morning to everyone. The strong results we\u2019ve achieved in the quarter completed what was a successful year for the company strategically, operationally, and financially. The consistent execution of our strategic agenda and the renewed vigor and confidence across the organization enabled us to deliver balanced geographic and portfolio growth throughout the year. The fourth quarter was no different, as all of our operating units once again delivered positive volume growth.  Clearly the systems investments behind this brand, its people and its capabilities are paying off and we have built a strong foundation for sustainable long-term performance.  In the first quarter of last year, I outlined my key priorities for 2007 and I am proud to say that due to the dedication of our people around the world, we have made significant progress against each of those initiatives.  First, our international operations continued to be the primary driver of growth for the company. Volume performance exceeded our long-term growth target in every quarter of 2007. This success reflects the disciplined execution and local approach of our bottling partners every day in the marketplace and the connection of our brands with consumers around the world.  Second, in North America we took a number of aggressive actions which addressed some of our challenges and enabled us to deliver on our commitment of sequential improvement in the second half of 2007. We remain committed to restoring consistent growth in our home market while becoming the preferred beverage partner for our customers.  Third, our system-wide efforts resulted in improved efficiency for faster decision making and operating expense savings. These savings created operating expense leverage and were partially reinvested to drive top line growth.  And finally, we continue to push the envelope with innovation in product, packaging, delivery, as well as customer service. The global success of Coca-Cola Zero, our most successful launch in the past 25 years, is a perfect example of this.  Today I\u2019d like to share with you details on our progress and add some perspective on our priorities for 2008.  Our international operations continued their strong performance and increased full year unit case volume by 8%. The performance was broad-based, as evidenced by 19 of our key 22 markets delivering positive growth.  Unit case volume growth in our international operations was led by the emerging markets. For the year, we achieved double-digit unit case volume growth in such markets as China, India, Brazil, Russia, Turkey, Eastern Europe, and Southern Eurasia. In the Philippines, since we acquired control of the bottling operations we also have delivered double-digit growth. Africa also produced solid balanced growth across key markets, including a 13% growth in South Africa.  Whilst it is clear that we are maintaining our focus and winning internationally, there are a few key markets that I would like to highlight where aligned system execution is delivering progress and results.  Latin America continued the success with all business units delivering solid growth. Latin America is now our largest operating group in volume terms, selling over 6 billion unit cases. It is also our second most profitable operating unit with $1.75 billion in operating income. Mexico increased unit case volume 6% while Argentina increased 9% and Brazil delivered double-digit growth.  The strong performance reflects the success of our strategies to drive growth in sparkling beverages led by trademark Coca-Cola and expand our footprint in still beverages both organically as well as through acquisitions, such as Jugos del Valle.  The strong performance in Mexico is particularly noteworthy as it validates our ability to transfer best practices to drive balanced growth in high per capita markets all around the world.  In Mexico, our highest per capita market in the world, we added another 25 servings per person in 2007. The growth across the portfolio led to share gains in both sparkling as well as still beverages for the group.  The European Union group has established a solid foundation for sustainable growth, evidenced in the balanced geographic and category performance. Our marketing programs and strong execution of our bottling partners provided the platform to overcome a difficult summer weather comparison from 2006.  For the year, unit case volume increased 3%, successfully cycling 6% growth in the prior year, as we achieved solid growth in most key markets. We are encouraged by our progress in Great Britain, which returned to growth in the fourth quarter.  Full year volume results in Germany were positive, although volume was slightly down in the quarter as we cycled strong growth in the prior year quarter.  We continue to make progress in this market as demonstrated by our move to a one bottler system and remain confident that we are building a foundation for consistent sustainable performance in Germany over time. Europe delivered solid growth with sparkling beverages up 2% and still beverages up 15% for the year. Sparkling growth was driven by 3% growth in trademark Coca-Cola, including the continued success of Coca-Cola Zero, now in 21 countries in the E.U.  The strong performance of still beverages was the result of solid organic growth in Minute Maid, along with Nestea, Aquarius, Powerade, and Burn, as well as targeted bolt-on acquisitions. The brand performance led to volume and value share gains in both sparkling and still beverages for the quarter and the full year.  It is clear we have the right strategies in place and the E.U. leadership team is effectively managing our business with the goal of delivering consistent, sustainable growth.  In 2007, we also validated our track record of rapidly addressing problem markets and delivering on our commitments to restore growth to those markets. Let me give you some examples.  Japan delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of unit case volume growth, cycling 2% growth in the prior year quarter. Importantly, all four key trademarks delivered growth. A double-digit volume increase in trademark Coca-Cola drove sparkling beverage growth. Execution of the three cola strategy led to trademark Coca-Cola achieving its highest volume growth rate in 30 years.  Georgia grew 1% in the quarter, its first growth in eight quarters. The performance was driven by growth of the 190-milliliter can in the vending channels. The results reflect progress against our previously shared plans to stabilize Georgia\u2019s performance.  Aquarius and tea brands Sokenbicha, Karada Meguri-Cha, and [Iyethica] also continued to perform strongly with innovation and solid integrated marketing execution, leading to all four brands gaining share for the year.  We have gained significant traction in Japan during 2007. With our management team in place and the health of our brand portfolio improving, we will continue to build upon a stabilized business in 2008.  Now let me turn to the Philippines. After acquiring the bottling franchise in March of 2007, we committed to quickly stabilize this key market and demonstrate sequential improvement throughout 2007. Our team\u2019s effort to seamlessly integrate and improve execution through improved availability and focus on rapid execution resulted in performance ahead of our original expectations and volume growth for the full year.  We continue to invest in market capabilities and cold drink equipment while driving supply chain efficiencies. We remain confident that our management team will continue to drive growth in 2008 in the Philippines.  Overall, I am very pleased with the performance of our international operations. We have a talented and experienced team of operators across the system and our bottling partners are aligned to deliver high quality, broad-based growth while investing to solidify the foundation for sustainable growth in the future.  Let me now discuss the progress we are making in North America. In the fourth quarter, we achieved 1% unit case volume growth, the second consecutive quarter of growth, and we delivered on our commitment of sequential improvement in the second half of 2007.  We continue to focus on revitalizing the sparkling beverage category with our three cola strategy, Red, Black and Silver. For the year, all three brands gained category share. Coca-Cola Zero continued to deliver strong double-digit unit case volume growth even after two years in the market place.  Our key priorities for Coca-Cola Zero are continuing to build trial, increase awareness, and furthering channel penetration.  For the second year in a row, the Coke side of life ads that were featured during the Super Bowl telecast were amongst the favorites of both media critics and viewers. It\u2019s Mine, where the nice guy finishes first in a tussle for a Coke over the streets of Manhattan, made the top 10 list in U.S.A. Today\u2019s ad meter and also was the most popular non-alcoholic beverage commercial out of nine beverage ads that aired during the Super Bowl event.  The Glaceau acquisition continues to perform beyond our expectations as the trademark achieved triple-digit unit case volume growth in the quarter, driven by both sales velocity and increased availability. Additionally, we successfully moved distribution to a hybrid model to take advantage of the strength of our system while leveraging Glaceau\u2019s unique [route] to market strategy.  I am pleased to report that the transition to our bottlers has been successful. This acquisition has aligned our North America system and we continue to expect the acquisition to act as a catalyst for growth across our entire North American business.  While we have made significant strides with our portfolio and organization in 2007, we still have much to accomplish. Overall, however, I am confident that our North America system is executing against the right priorities and we remain relentlessly committed to our goal of returning our whole market to sustainable growth.  Our successes with Coca-Cola Zero, Glaceau, Powerade, Fuse, Full Throttle, Minute Maid, Simply Juices, Dasani, and our recent investment in Honest Tea, provides the business a much stronger base from which to build in 2008. Our bottling partners are aligned and the system is in an improved position to serve our customers and compete in the marketplace, even with an uncertain U.S. macroeconomic environment.  Finally, I\u2019d like to share the progress we\u2019ve made in driving efficiency and effectiveness. As I\u2019ve said, the results of productivity ultimately is leverage in the income statement. In 2007, we successfully achieved this in the core business, as well as in our bottling investments group.  We flattened our organizations of 80 fully functional offices to 37 business units across the world. This allows us to improve the speed of decision-making and it improves our effectiveness.  We executed lean productivity initiatives at our concentrate manufacturing facilities and were able to increase capacity as well as operational efficiencies. This resulted in the elimination of costs associated with the concentrate plant in Ireland.  Within bottling investments, we reallocated expenses from manufacturing and production supply chain and invested in market facing roles to further drive execution in the trade.  For The Coca-Cola Company, productivity remains a critical growth enabler to ensure the sustainability of our results over time. Looking forward, we see three main areas of opportunity.  First, supply chain optimization, which will allow our system to maintain or enhance our gross margins and increase affordability of our product.  Second, marketing and innovation effectiveness, where we optimize investments behind our brands and leverage global best practices.  And third, operating efficiencies, which we use to fuel growth and build a foundation for future performance. This includes the ability to fund investments behind the highest impact innovations in products, packaging, ingredients, as well as equipment.  As I look forward into 2008, part of the reason I remain confident is the result of the robust planning process we completed with our bottling partners. We have the plans in place to drive towards our ultimate goal of sustainable growth. We are focused on five strategic priorities.  First, continue to drive growth from our leadership position in sparkling beverages. Sparkling beverages provides the oxygen to our business. We know there is tremendous opportunity to grow all of our sparkling products in both developed as well as emerging markets.  Second, drive faster growth in our still beverage portfolio by adding new functional benefits, developing affordable formulations, pursuing strategic bolt-on acquisitions, and seeking margin enhancements.  Third, continue to generate and leverage the balanced growth that we have achieved across our geographic footprint. Growth in our emerging and BRIC markets remain robust, even as headwinds are developing in the U.S. economy. In North America, our business is stronger, our bottlers continue to invest, and we are better positioned from a portfolio and operating structure basis.  Fourth, accelerate the commercialization of our innovation pipeline through aggressive investments in product, ingredients, packaging, and equipment.  Fifth, further strengthen our system capabilities. Consumer marketing, commercial leadership, and franchise leadership remain our core capabilities. We will continue to drive productivity across our system so that we can expedite decision making and rapidly respond to the changing marketplace.  Savings extracted from these initiatives will enhance our ability to achieve consistent and sustained growth.  And last but not least, leadership development is a top priority across our system, fostering even more collaboration, accountability, clarity, and calculated risk taking than ever before.  Supporting all of this is our staunch belief in the health of our business, supported by the sustainability of the communities we serve. We understand that by acting as an engaged positive corporate citizen, we helped create communities of favorably disposed consumers and as those communities grow, our business continues to flourish.  I am pleased with the results we achieved and the progress we made against our strategic agenda. As we enter 2008, we\u2019ll be watching carefully with the volatility in the macroeconomic environment.  From the strengthened foundation which I referred to earlier, we are better prepared to weather any potential challenges. I look forward to 2008 being another successful year for The Coca-Cola Company.  Now let me turn the call over to Gary. Thank you. \nGary P. Fayard: Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning. As Neville and Muhtar indicated, the fourth quarter was a solid finish to the year, where we achieved strong consistent performance in all quarters. As you saw in the release, reported earnings per share was $0.52 on a diluted basis for the fourth quarter, an increase of 79%. This included a net charge of $0.06 per share, primarily related to restructuring charges and some asset write-downs. Therefore, after considering items impacting comparability in both the current and prior year, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.58 versus $0.52 in the prior year, an increase of 12%.  This is our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth and it\u2019s important to note that we successfully cycled our toughest quarterly comparison, cycling double-digit growth in both ongoing operating income and earnings per share in Q4 2006, again with double-digit growth in Q4 2007.  I am sure you\u2019ve also noticed that our volume growth rate for the quarter was 5% versus our full year growth of 6%. We believe this is a very solid result. Sparkling beverages grew 4% for the quarter and for the full year. Still beverages increased 11% versus full year 12%. This quarter was impacted by a strategic decision to de-emphasize low value water in several countries, such as China, which caused volume to round down to 5% in the quarter.  For the year, reported earnings per share increased 19% to $2.57. This included a net charge of $0.13 per share, primarily related to restructuring charges. After considering items impacting comparability in both years, earnings per share was $2.70 versus $2.37 in the prior year, a 14% increase.  For the year, unit case volume growth was 6%, in line with concentrate sales. Revenue growth was 20% and 12% excluding structural changes related to bottler acquisitions. The increase was driven by a 6% increase in concentrate, a 4% currency benefit, and a 2% favorable impact from price and mix. After considering factors impacting comparability, operating income growth was 14% and 10% on a currency neutral basis.  In terms of margins, our core business remains healthy and expanded margins for the full year as we drove top line growth and delivered operating expense leverage. Bottling investments continues to improve margins as well.  Cash from operations for the year increased 20% to $7.1 billion on strong underlying business performance and a decrease in working capital. We repurchased approximately $1.75 billion of our stock for the full year, in line with our prior guidance. Additionally, the company paid $3.1 billion in dividends to shareowners in 2007. For 2007, this contributed to a 30% total return to our shareowners.  Now let me address some of the factors that we see impacting the company in 2008. As you know, our long-term growth targets are 3% to 4% volume growth, 6% to 8% ongoing currency neutral operating income growth, and high-single-digit ongoing earnings per share growth.  We successfully exceeded these targets in 2007. Our picture of success will be to continue to exceed these targets. We recognize that there is some uncertainty, particularly as it relates to the U.S. economy. However, as Muhtar said, we remain committed to restoring growth in our home market and believe our business is well-positioned to navigate headwinds that might develop.  Emerging and BRIC markets have maintained their robust growth, even against the backdrop of uncertainty in the U.S. market, and we remain positive on the global macroeconomic outlook, especially in many of these emerging markets.  As Muhtar detailed, we will continue to focus on driving efficiency and effectiveness across our organization and will utilize the realized benefits to further improve our ability to deliver consistent and sustained performance.  On commodity cost, 2007 was certainly a difficult year with cost pressures from several of our key system inputs, particularly in North America. Commodity cost volatility remains a risk. However, as we said on the third quarter call, for 2008 we continue to expect to see a moderation in commodity cost pressures. Currently our assumptions on commodity cost pressures. Currently our assumptions on commodity costs versus 2007 are a slight increase for the system and essentially flat for the company. We expect to deliver operating expense leverage on both the core and bottling business in 2008 and we will continue to invest behind our brands and innovation initiatives. Additionally, selling and service expenses will increase as we invest for growth in our bottling operations as well as investments behind our brand acquisitions, particularly in North America.  General and administrative expenses were tightly controlled in 2007 and we will continue our disciplined approach in 2008.  We would expect net interest costs to increase for 2008 as we carry a full year of higher debt associated with our 2007 acquisitions.  For 2008, our best estimate is that the full year underlying effective tax rate will be between 22% and 22.5%.  From a capital expenditure standpoint, we purchased approximately $1.4 billion in net PP&E during 2007. For 2008, we expect the total company net capital expenditures will be approximately $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion as we make investments in recently acquired bottling operations.  And we anticipate that our range of share repurchase on a gross basis will be $1.5 billion to $2 billion this year.  Now let me move to currency. We\u2019re effectively covered for the full year on the YEN and for the first three quarters of 2008 on the other key hard currencies. Based on anticipated benefits of current hedging coverage in place, the company expects currencies to have a minimal impact on operating income in 2008.  Finally, let me say a few words about quarterly phasing. As many of you know, we report unit case volume on an average daily sales basis, kind of like same-store sales, to eliminate comparability issues due to calendar variations.  For 2008, we will have one extra day, since it is a leap year. The first quarter will have one fewer day than Q107 and the fourth quarter will have two more days versus Q407. This will not impact our unit case sales reporting but will impact our concentrate sales and therefore revenues. Additionally, also remember that Easter will shift from Q2 last year into Q1 this year.  Those are the topics that I wanted to cover and now we can turn it over to your questions. Operator. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Judy Hong, Goldman Sachs.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Good morning, everyone. Just looking at the fourth quarter volume trends globally, you\u2019ve talked about a bit of a slowdown sequentially. I\u2019m just wondering how much of the decision to de-emphasize the water brand really impacted the global volume number. \nMuhtar Kent: Basically we had sparkling growth was both the same number for the full year as well as for the fourth quarter, and we still achieved 6% growth in sparkling in the international business. So we are very pleased with that trend.  What you see is a slight slowing down of the still beverages, mainly water and that because we\u2019ve had growth in juice, good growth in juice comparable to the full year, same as in -- also in sports, also for tea and coffee. Essentially, it\u2019s been a de-emphasizing of the water business in big large markets, particularly in Asia, like China, as well as in Indonesia and therefore -- and mainly as a result of that category being low value for us.  So it\u2019s been a specific action on our part and we feel very confident about our business in all the categories. \nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: And just kind of following up on that in terms of just looking at just over the next 12 to 24 months and thinking about the macro outlook and you sounded still pretty positive about the macro, but just in terms of whether there are any regions or markets that may be a bit more concerning if the U.S. starts to show a bigger slowdown?\nNeville Isdell: Well, Judy -- by the way, just one other on the water, just to give you a data point -- full year growth was 13%. If we take out vitamin water here, the quarter was 8%, so that gives you the metric in terms of what happened with regard to water in the fourth quarter.  We don\u2019t see there being a major impact on the emerging economies or the developing economies. There will be one or two economies in the developed world there will be housing bubbles, where we think there will be some pull-back. But balanced with that, we think the momentum that we have behind our existing brands and the new brands, the better execution, all the things that we talked about on our call are such that we are going to be able to manage what may be a half-a-percent decline at the worst in terms of overall global growth. And I think we already addressed the U.S. issue.  So let me put it to you this way -- we feel we\u2019ve really got a strong tailwind behind our business and that that is going to carry us through 2008 even as we see some areas where there will be some economic dislocation. \nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Bill Pecoriello with Morgan Stanley.\nBill Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley: I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the Pacific division, which decelerated sequentially. Aside from the China water strategy, some of the other markets that you didn\u2019t discuss in the release -- Indonesia, Korea -- if there were some reasons there for the sequential deceleration versus the prior quarters and what efforts you are doing in those markets to improve the growth. Thanks. \nMuhtar Kent: Essentially, Indonesia was specifically related again to a slowdown of the water, just like we mentioned for China. As far as Korea is concerned, as you know we\u2019ve had a transition of our evolving partnership there and we are very confident that our new partnership and alignment with our new bottling partner there will take us into a modality of growth in Korea for the years to come and we are very confident about that. And there\u2019s been a slight slowing down in the Australian economy but we feel generally confident that our business will perform in terms of its past historical trends in 2008 quarter by quarter in the Pacific. \nNeville Isdell: Just to pick up on Korea, I think there is a real pattern here that you\u2019ve seen with us in terms of acquisitions. In some instances, we were able to turn it around very quickly like the Philippines. In others, there have been more in-depth reforms required. Germany would be one example of that. And we take the pain along the way and that\u2019s really Korea. That\u2019s the story of Korea and we are confident that we\u2019ll see that one turning around. I think we\u2019ve got a good track record on that and we can deliver against it. \nBill Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley: And then on the bottled water, we should expect that across the four quarters as you made that decision and that would impact the following three quarters as well?\nMuhtar Kent: No, I don\u2019t believe that that will. I think that we now are in a situation where we are going into 2008 pretty clean in terms of where we want to be in the water category. \nBill Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley: Thanks. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: A question on operating leverage; if you look at the 10% organic or currency neutral operating profit growth for the year, if you could give us a breakdown of how much of that growth was acquisitions, how much was cost savings, and then how much was underlying organic growth.  And then, as we look into \u201908, you\u2019ve taken -- the company has taken over $400 million of charges over the last two years and what\u2019s the pay-back on some of the restructuring actions? And as we look at \u201908, what should we be thinking about in terms of productivity as a contributor to profit growth?\nGary P. Fayard: Okay, Bryan. We hesitated on you for a minute because as we take these questions, we\u2019re just trying to make sure that in fact you are who you say you are. \nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: I am the real deal. \nGary P. Fayard: As has been experienced by a few companies over the last couple of weeks. As we look at it, let me take you through a couple of different ways. Basically if you look at currency neutral operating income, we\u2019ve gotten about -- of the 10% growth, about 8% of that is out of the core concentrate business, about a point is out of the bottling investments group, and about a point out of acquisitions, so that\u2019s how it comes to your 10% operating income growth currency neutral. \nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: Okay. \nGary P. Fayard: Relative to the charges, we in fact had within OpEx, and let me just talk about the quarter and the year, kind of the same. What we did this year, we had significant increase actually in marketing because we continue to invest behind the brands and we in fact accelerated some of that in the fourth quarter because we\u2019ve had a really good year and we recognize that we have the flexibility to do that, to continue to drive the growth that we are seeing across all of our markets.  Within sales and service it\u2019s been up but primarily it\u2019s been up because of the acquisitions, primarily the bottlers but you\u2019ll see some continue to increase from that not only there but also the brands.  Within G&A -- in fact, G&A in the fourth quarter on a -- if you kind of make it apples-to-apples, G&A in the fourth quarter was up 3% and 100% of that was due to incentive plans that we\u2019ve accrued for long-term plans because we\u2019ve actually exceeded and it\u2019s where we want to be.  Relative to restructuring charges, the biggest restructuring charges this year was really around closing a concentrate in Ireland, which will be completely closed by mid-year 2008. It was a result, as we said, from applying lean manufacturing techniques to that and we\u2019ve been able to in fact shut down a whole plant without any increases anywhere else. We are taking though -- some of that is going to the bottom line but a lot of that we are reinvesting actually behind the brand and into innovation to really drive the sustainability of this business over the long-term. \nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: So is it fair to say that the pool of productivity is going to be bigger in \u201908 than it was in \u201907? It\u2019s just a matter of how much you spend back and how much you flex to the bottom line?\nMuhtar Kent: I\u2019d just like to make one comment just to build on what Gary said. You will see us relentlessly focusing across the entire organization on the effectiveness and the efficiency measures and also the programs. And we -- as we said, we\u2019ll take some of that to create more expense leverage on the P&L and we will continue to invest for the health of our brands long-term. \nNeville Isdell: Bryan, just on the fourth quarter marketing spend, when I came back, I discovered that we had major markets in the fourth quarter that weren\u2019t spending a penny. The numbers weren\u2019t that good but they still weren\u2019t spending a penny. We are back up at a level now where we\u2019ve got 12 months good, solid support right behind our brands and that\u2019s part of what you saw in the fourth quarter. So we are in good shape now going into \u201908. \nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: Okay, great. See you guys next week in Florida. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Muhtar, I was hoping on your priorities, specifically the one about accelerating still beverage growth, you could peel the onion a bit more for us there, talk a little bit about the role of existing brands in that acceleration and the role of new brands and give us some idea, if you can, about regions where you see the opportunity being bigger than other regions. \nMuhtar Kent: I think that, as I said, the key is organic growth, as I said in my remarks. Organic growth is the oxygen of our business and you will see us continue to drive innovation in organic growth in still beverages. I think the Minute Maid brand and the success of it in markets like China and Vietnam, Korea is a great example of that. I think you will see us -- we\u2019ve just launched that also in India and it\u2019s doing very, very well. You will see us focused on Glaceau internationally. You will see us certainly adding much more functionality and benefits to our still portfolio through innovation and I\u2019d like to just highlight one thing that Neville said. We are now the leaders in juice in all four BRIC markets. That\u2019s an incredible footprint. When you look at Brazil, when you look at Russia with our Dobriy brand. When you look at Brazil with Jugos del Valle and Suco Mais and when you look at China with the Minute Maid Pulpy across all metro markets, number one. In India with Mazaa, both in the mango category of juice as well as in the leading mango category as well as in the citrus now with our new launch, and many other emerging markets.  So you will see us focus much more on organic growth. We\u2019ve got a great portfolio and we have a great innovation pipeline that we will drive through that portfolio. \nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: And I know it\u2019s early but your comment on Glaceau internationally, we\u2019ve heard your willingness to look at that since the day you announced the deal, but you\u2019ve had maybe six, seven, eight months to test the water from a consumer buy-in or potential for buy-in in markets other than the U.S., other than North America. Have you found anything of interest there in terms of the opportunity for that brand on the other side of the world, if you will?\nMuhtar Kent: You will certainly see Glaceau in international markets in the very near future. And CCE yesterday said that they will launch it in Canada in quarter two. I think you will see us in different international markets with that brand. \nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, and the linkage between that and Powerade here in North America is notable. Is that a fair linkage to make, at least in some cases on the other side of the Atlantic and Pacific?\nMuhtar Kent: Well, we have said always that Glaceau is a wonderful brand that transgresses categories and sources volume from different categories, whether it\u2019s sports or enhanced waters or the entire active lifestyle category. So it\u2019s a category really on its own and we believe that it will also hit the same buttons with consumers in international markets as we progress that trademark, vitamin water, into international markets. \nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Very good. Thank you, Muhtar. \nOperator: Your next question comes from John Faucher with J.P. Morgan.\nJohn Faucher - J.P. Morgan: Good morning, everyone. A quick question on Japan; it looks as though the fourth quarter of this year was only about the second positive volume number on a positive comp in the past couple of years, the last being last year\u2019s Q4. So can you talk a little bit about the ability to sustain that? What level of operating profit you\u2019ve been delivering in Japan on a currency neutral basis over the past year or so and can you keep the volume positive while maybe needing to accelerate the operating profit growth there over the next couple of years? Thanks. \nMuhtar Kent: I have said that clearly our target was to stabilize Japan and we have done that in 2008 and we have consecutively -- in 2007 and we have consecutively delivered quarter after quarter growth.  We are now in a much more normalized position in Japan, so you will see us delivering between 1% and 3% growth over the years. That\u2019s our target. That\u2019s basically how we see the picture of success.  We expect modest profit growth in Japan. Importantly also, as we have stabilized Japan in 2007 and from the end of 2006 and into 2007, what we see now also is that our bottlers, our bottling partners are in a much more strengthened position. Their willingness to invest in the marketplace is much more and I think that you are seeing one of the key categories in Japan -- one of the also important things in Japan in 2007 was that we had growth in two of the key channels, both in the vending channel as well as in the supermarket channel and the vending channel, of course, as you know, is a very highly profitable important channel and our bottler\u2019s willingness to continue to invest will drive further growth in that channel is our belief. \nJohn Faucher - J.P. Morgan: Okay, so what it sounds as though your levels of incremental investment over the past couple of years, it sounds like you kind of -- you feel like you\u2019ve normalized the margins maybe there and we should see a more normalized growth rate going forward. Is that the right way to look at it?\nMuhtar Kent: As I said, we\u2019ve stabilized the business and we are looking for a more normalized growth rate in Japan going forward and we believe also that we\u2019ve strengthened our brands in all the categories. Sparkling notably in 2007 was a key category that has grown, particularly the trademark Coca-Cola, very pleased double-digit growth, the highest in 30 years. The tea category is also growing and very healthy in terms of our brand, as well as Aquarius and as I mentioned in the call, we\u2019ve also had a growth in Georgia Coffee in the fourth quarter of 2007. \nJohn Faucher - J.P. Morgan: Thanks. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Carlos Laboy with Credit Suisse.\nCarlos Laboy - Credit Suisse : My question relates to some of these bottling JVs. You now have a growing collection of these non-carb JVs building around the world. Do you see more of these in the future and could you speak to some of the benefits and challenges of these arrangements and how they might affect your bottling relationships?\nMuhtar Kent: First, let me just say that we are very pleased at where our bottling relationships are, in terms of how we are aligned, how we are planning together in joint force and how we see the future and the picture of success jointly together.  It\u2019s a very simple reason why we have these JVs, because we believe that the categories that we have these JVs in are much better suited to be operated through these JVs, like we have now formed in Latin America for our juice acquisition and like the ones that we have in Europe and it basically creates the focus, it creates the scale, and it creates the economics that deal properly with the categories and allows the bottling partners and us to focus on how we build that business together. \nCarlos Laboy - Credit Suisse : Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Christine Farkas with Merrill Lynch.\nChristine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much. Good morning. Gary, I have a question for you regarding your buy-back plans for 2008. You\u2019ve indicated similar levels in \u201908 to 2007, which was under my impression pulled back based on your acquisition of Glaceau. Can you help us understand, given that your cash flows can allow a larger buy-back, what\u2019s going into that consideration? I understand CCE\u2019s plans for buy-back. Perhaps there are other considerations there. Can you help us understand why that level is where it is for \u201908?\nGary P. Fayard: Sure, or at least I\u2019ll try. Let me go through that. First, as we look at it, as you look at the credit markets and the volatility there and with some modest increase of debt levels, we think it\u2019s prudent at this point to be somewhat conservative in some of our financial policies and therefore with what we are looking at, as well as maintaining credit ratings for the system, we think the $1.5 billion to $2 billion is a pretty good place to start the year. I think it\u2019s important as we go through the year, we\u2019ll update you on that.  The share repurchase that was announced by CCE yesterday is also very modest. Really dealing with kind of trying to keep their share count kind of flat, so a pretty modest share repurchase program.  So I would say -- I would sum it up probably as we\u2019ll be a little cautious just because of volatility in the markets but stay tuned and we\u2019ll update you as we go through the year, and because the credit ratings are pretty important to us as well. \nChristine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Well, the CCE program is modest. Would you anticipate participating in that to maintain your stake?\nGary P. Fayard: No, I think -- I mean, that will just be arms length where they are just going into the market, I would think. \nChristine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Okay, great, and just on the back of acquisitions, can you tell us how much Glaceau contributed to your North American volumes in the quarter?\nGary P. Fayard: About two points. \nChristine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks, Gary. \nAnn Taylor: Operator, we have time for one more question. \nOperator: Your last question comes from Justin Hott with Bear Stearns. \nJustin Hott - Bear Stearns: Thanks. On Glaceau, CCE yesterday mentioned that they might have been a little bit slower in promotional activity in the fourth quarter due to I guess the transition there. Would it be fair to say that CCE is ramping up that Glaceau can even accelerate its great growth? And also, if you could just give us, since it\u2019s the last question, some comments on CoBos and where you stand with some of them around the world, your plans there. Thanks. \nMuhtar Kent: Was the last question on CoBos? Okay, just let me give you the answer on Glaceau. It\u2019s absolutely it was related to the transition and it\u2019s back on a normalized sequence now in terms of our promotional calendar. And what you\u2019ve seen is that we\u2019ve had very good progressive increases as we\u2019ve transitioned the distribution, bottler distribution into our bottlers, an increase in supermarkets for distribution as well as in convenience stores for both vitamin water, smart water, as well as vitamin energy. So all of the components are working very well for us as we\u2019ve moved into a normalized fashion.  And as far as the CoBos are concerned, as we\u2019ve said to you before, we will continue to look at opportunities in our ownerships and where we see some opportunities for divestiture, we will. And you\u2019ve heard Neville mention our BIG as a hospital ward and we\u2019re very happy with the performance of our BIG group but over time, you will see us taking some more on board and divesting some. \nJustin Hott - Bear Stearns: Thanks. \nNeville Isdell: Thank you, Muhtar and Gary. Just to wrap up, and also thanks to each one of you for joining us this morning. So now we\u2019re in 2008 and it\u2019s the next step on our journey. I am confident that we\u2019ve laid a solid foundation on which to build in 2008 and we remain I assure you resolute about delivering against our strategic agenda this year as we did in \u201807. We\u2019ll continue to leverage our leading brands, our global footprint, and our strategic acquisitions.  You\u2019re going to see us building also on our innovation pipeline, which we didn\u2019t talk a lot about today, and all the while driving efficiency to deliver sustainable growth and shareowner value. Thank you very much indeed. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s fourth quarter 2007 earnings results conference call. Thank you for your participation.

(Operator Instructions) Iwould like to now introduce Ann Taylor, Vice President and Director of InvestorRelations.\nAnn Taylor: Good morning, and thank you for being with us today. I amjoined by Neville Isdell, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; MuhtarKent, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Gary Fayard, our ChiefFinancial Officer. Following prepared remarksthis morning, we will turn the call over for your questions.  Before we get started, I would like to remind you that thisconference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statementsconcerning long-term earnings objectives and should be considered inconjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and inthe company's most recent SEC report. In addition, I would also like to note that we have postedschedules on our company website at theCocaColaCompany.com under the financialinformation tab in the investor section, which reconciles our results asreported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principals to certain non-GAAPmeasures which may be referred to by our senior executives in our discussionthis morning, and from time to time in discussing our financial performance.Please look on our website for this information.  Now let me turn the call over to Neville.\nNeville Isdell: Thank you, Ann and good morning, everyone. I will start thismorning with just a few brief observations about the third quarter results, andthen Muhtar will provide details on operational performance and Garywill follow with an overview of the financials.  Today we report another quarter of solid business results.The strength of our brand portfolio, the breadth of our global system and theculture of winning increasingly exhibited by our talented people right acrossthe company and the system continue to drive our business forward. Theinvestments that we have made in our brands, our early and continued focus onrevitalizing the culture through our manifesto for growth, and our commitmenttogether with our bottling partners to re-energize our marketing and improveoperational execution are all working. They are driving high quality, balancedgrowth in volume, revenues, profits and cash flow. This is the third consecutive quarter in which we haveachieved 6% global unit case growth. Notably, this is our tenth consecutivequarter of delivering at least 4% volume growth, and top line growth continuesto be robust, reflecting our ability to capture the highest value opportunitiesacross the whole non-alcoholic, ready to drink industry.  Revenues increased 19% in the quarter. Now the acquisitionof bottlers contributed about 8 points of this growth, so even excluding thisimpact, revenues grew a very strong 11%, demonstrating the success of thecontinued system-wide focus on revenue growth management and segmentedexecution strategies.  We delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digitcomparable EPS growth, up 15% versus the prior year. Ongoing operating incomefor the quarter increased 12%, and year-to-date increased 13%. Cash fromoperations for the quarter increased 18% on solid underlying businessperformance. Importantly, our focus on productivity is resulting inoperating expense leverage for our core business. Our effective management ofcommodity cost pressures is also reflected in the results.  Our international operations again led the way, posting unitcase volume growth of 8%, and once again driving strong top line performance. Thegrowth continues to be sourced from both developed and emerging markets. Allinternational operating groups, with the exception of the European Union --which as anticipated had a challenging prior year quarter this cycle --delivered strong growth.  We're also on track with our plans for North America, which recorded sequential volume improvement. In North America, I would like to highlight the continued execution of ourthree cola strategy; in particular, Coca-Cola Zero, and also our ability todrive our still portfolio, which now of course includes Glacau. In terms of our global portfolio performance, we achievedcontinued volume growth in sparkling beverages, while expanding our footprintand enhancing our offerings in still beverages. Today we're reporting anincrease of 4% in sparkling beverages. Within sparkling, continued emphasis onour three cola strategy resulted in 4% global growth in trademark Coca-Cola.  Coke Zero, now launched in 51 countries, continues to drivethe expansion of the sparkling category and gain share. Given the strong repeatrates for Coca-Cola Zero, we're focused on driving trial via sampling programsto continue to recruit new consumers and retain core Coca-Cola drinkers withreal Coca-Cola taste and zero sugar and calories.  In still beverages, globally strong performance from ourwater portfolio, but also from POWERade and Minute Maid led to a 14% increase.This solid growth across the portfolio resulted in our gaining non-alcoholic readyto drink volume and value share globally, driven by share increases insparkling and still beverages, both internationally and importantly in NorthAmerica. I would note that value share is growing faster than volume share, aswe focused on the highest value opportunities.  Overall therefore I am very pleased with the strongperformance in the quarter and year-to-date. As we enter the final quarter ofthe year, we will continue to leverage our leading brands, our globalfootprint, and our strategic acquisitions. We'll build our innovation pipelineand all the while driving productivity to continue to deliver sustainablegrowth and shareholder value.  Now let me turn the call over to Muhtar to provide thedetails. \nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Neville, and good morning, everyone. Overall,this was another strong quarter for the Coca-Cola Company, both financially andstrategically. Importantly, we continued to deliver on our commitment. Weachieved balanced geographic and portfolio growth, further solidifying ourfoundation for sustainable, long-term performance.  Our international operations continue to drive results forthe company through the strength of our bottling system and the power of ourbrands around the world. The aggressive actions we continue to take to restoregrowth in North America are starting to bear fruit. Oursystem-wide productivity efforts are allowing us to focus on driving top linegrowth and creating operating expense leverage. Finally, we continue to pushthe envelope with innovation in product, packaging, delivery and customerservice. Today I would like to share with you details on our progressthis quarter, and add some perspective for the remainder of the year. Even witha very strong third quarter of 2006 to cycle in Europe,our international operations increased unit volume by 8% for the quarter,following our 9% growth in the first half of the year. Broad-based growthacross each of our international operating groups has enabled year-to-date volumegrowth of 6%. This speaks to the power of our global reach and the executioncapabilities of our bottling partners.  Volume growth in our international operations was once againled by the emerging markets. We achieved double-digit growth in such markets asChina, Russia,India, Brazil,Turkey, the Philippines,Pakistan, Eastern Europe and Southern Eurasia. Africaalso experienced solid growth across all business units. Additionally, weexperienced robust growth across Latin America. Mexicodelivered 7% growth in the quarter, a particularly strong performancereflecting the success of our strategies to drive growth in sparkling beveragesled by Trademark Coca-Cola.  While it is clear that we're maintaining our focus andwinning internationally, there are a few key markets that I would like tohighlight where best practice sharing is leading to world class execution.  In China,we once again achieved double-digit growth this quarter. We are aggressivelyand strategically investing in our infrastructure and our route to marketinitiatives to continuously adopt to a rapidly changing marketplace.Year-to-date we have activated over 120,000 outlets, placed approximately175,000 new coolers and we surpassed the 1 billion cases sold benchmark earlierthan any other year in our history.  Sprite in Chinacontinues to perform exceptionally well, growing nearly 30% in the quarter andyear-to-date. As we start the one year countdown to the Beijingsummer Olympics, our focus will be on leveraging our leading brands to become astaple in the local communities and ensuring our full portfolio is readilyavailable in every outlet.  Let me turn now to the Philippines,where our efforts have led to improved execution and seamless integration.After two quarters of managing the bottling operations, our double-digit volumegrowth is ahead of our expectations. We have a first-class management team inplace that has a deep commitment to, and understanding of, the marketplace. Weare investing in the market there, adding 2,000 additional front end salesforceassociates, while driving supply chain efficiency.  Next in India,strong double-digit volume growth reflects the benefits of the initiatives weput in place in 2006 to rebuild the fundamentals of the franchise. Our marketinginitiatives continue to gain traction, supported by improvements andinvestments made in the bottling operations, including a specific focus on theright route to market, supply chain and people capability. As a result, werecorded share gains in the quarter for both sparkling beverages led byTrademark Coca-Cola, as well as still beverages led by our juice brands.  Russiais another example of how we're working with our bottling partner to invest ina market with tremendous opportunity and growth potential. The Multon juicebusiness, including the leading Dobriy brand, continues to provide a solidplatform for growth in our still beverages. Also during the quarter, ourbottler demonstrated a commitment to this market by expanding capacity with theacquisition of a brand new plant.  Japandelivered another solid performance in the quarter. The team there iseffectively executing our strategy of leveraging our core brands, particularlyTrademark Coca-Cola, to drive progress. Overall in the quarter, we gained sharein non-alcoholic ready to drink beverages, a validation that our strategy isworking.  In the quarter, we delivered more than 4% increase in unitcase volume, our fourth consecutive quarter of growth, with August andSeptember achieving record breaking sales levels; performance driven by trademarkCoca-Cola with year-to-date volume growth at its highest growth rate in 30years.  From a marketing perspective the Coke Side of Life campaignand promotion behind Coke Zero are having measurable success. Year-to-date, wehave attracted nearly 5 million new drinkers to the trademark versus the prioryear.  We also leveraged our successful work that we have underwayin Europe linking Coke and iTunes by launching a similarprogram in Japanthat utilizes all brands and packages. Our still beverage portfolio in Japangrew in the quarter as well. Sokenbicha Tea, Aquarius sports drink and both ofour water brands drove the results with each gaining share.  While the favorable warm weather benefited most areas of ourbusiness, it did have an adverse effect on the coffee category. Results from GeorgiaCoffee in the quarter were disappointing, as gains in the recently introducedVintage label did not fully offset declines in other flavors. We remain focusedon driving growth in the coffee category through innovation, new promotions andcontinued marketing investments behind the brand. We have gained significant traction in Japanand it is reflected in the year-to-date results. But we do recognize we stillhave more work to do.  As expected, the European Union faced difficult 2006comparables that had benefited from World Cup activation and acquisition. Inthe current quarter, solid unit case volume growth in Central and Southern Europe was offset by a volume decline in Western Europe,resulting from unfavorable summer weather across Western Europeand the difficult cycling. I am satisfied that we have the right strategies inplace and the initiatives taken by the EU leadership team over the last twoyears have built a solid foundation for balanced, sustainable, long-term growthin Europe. Year-to-date, volumes in the EU have increased 4%. For thethird quarter, after removing the impact of acquisitions, the two-year compoundorganic growth rate is 2%. The performance of both our sparkling beverages andthe ongoing expansion of our still footprint are two strong indicators of theimprovements we have made.  Additionally, as a result of our successful programs, we'veoutperformed the industry in the quarter and year-to-date across the EU. Wehave made broad improvements in sparkling beverages through innovation andtargeted execution led by the implementation of our three cola strategy and thesuccess of Coke Zero.  The roll-out strategy has delivered year-to-date trademarkCoca-Cola growth of 3% and Coke Zero, which is now available in Europein 20 countries, has become approximately a 3 share brand across the EU, andhas achieved as high as an 8 share in markets like Denmarkand Greece.That is a direct result of the close alignments we have with our bottlingpartners as we execute this key strategy. Additionally, we are driving expansion of our still platformacross Europe, both organically and throughacquisitions. Minute Maid, along with Nestea, Aquarius, POWERade and Burn, allachieved growth year-to-date driving still category share gain.  In Germany,we had a particularly challenging quarter this cycle as we achieved volumegrowth of 15% in the third quarter of 2006. While volume was down in Germanyfor the quarter, during the year we've been able to stabilize share performanceand we continue to make progress in executing our plans for long-term growth.  We also continue to improve channel penetration as webroaden our offerings to discounters, enhancing our position in a growingchannel where we have historically been under-represented. Also during thequarter, we finalized an agreement to consolidate the German bottlers. Ourfocus has now turned to improving our speed and flexibility with our customers andover time, driving supply chain efficiency. Overall, I am very pleased with the performance of ourinternational operations and our operators continue to deliver high quality,broad-based growth while maintaining investments to solidify the foundation forsustainable growth in the future.  Let me now discuss the progress we're making in North America. In the quarter, we achieved 1% unit case volume growth,the first quarter of growth in five quarters. While this reflects the benefitof acquisitions and an improved trend in sparkling beverages, we are notsatisfied with our performance. However, I am confident that our North America system is executing against the right priorities and isfully committed to restoring sustainable growth in our home market. We continueto focus on revitalizing the sparkling beverage strategy with our three colastrategy: Red, Black and Silver.  Coca-Cola Zero, which achieved a 1.3 share in the quarter,delivered strong double-digit unit case volume growth and along with Diet Coke,drove sparkling category share gains in the quarter. We believe there is stillsignificant opportunity for increased awareness and penetration for Coke Zero. Building on our success in Asia and Latin America, we introduced the new contour grip bottle in the U.S.for all three cola brands. While only launched in early September, we havealready achieved approximately 75% availability. The new bottle not only allowsus to further leverage our iconic image, but the package also contains 5% lessweight than the prior 20-ounce bottle, reducing our carbon footprint andmanufacturing cost. This is just the first of many exciting package innovationsthat we'll be pilot testing in different North America markets over the comingmonths.  The Glacau acquisition continues to perform ahead of ourexpectations as we have been able to leverage the strength of the system whilemaintaining the culture and innovation capabilities of the Glacau team. In thequarter, brand growth continued to accelerate, driven by both sales velocityand increased availability. We expect Glacau to continue to be a catalyst fordriving growth across the entire North America business. Last quarter, I mentioned that we were working with ourbottlers and distribution partners to develop a hybrid operating model thatwould take advantage of the strength of the system and leverage existing routesto market. As we announced during the quarter, I am pleased to report that wehave finalized an agreement with nearly 100% of our U.S.bottlers on this front. This is real progress and speaks to the effectivealignment with our North America bottling partners. Webelieve the new operating model will benefit our system, will bring value toour customers and will deliver attractive returns to our share owners. Duringthe fourth quarter, we will be working to ensure seamless transition to thisnew operating model.  Additionally, as part of the agreement, we gained brandalignment for the next three years and agreed on our 2008 business planpriority. Overall, we remain relentlessly committed to our goal ofre-energizing our business in North America and becomingthe preferred beverage partner for our customers. In the fourth quarter, wewill continue to expect sequential improvement and further evidence of ourprogress as we execute against our key priorities.  Finally, I would like to discuss some of the initialprogress we have made in driving productivity to improve margin performance.Our objective is simple: improve our speed of execution and drive operatingexpense leverage. When we organize around our three pillars, namely consumermarketing, customer leadership and franchise leadership, not only do we driveour top line growth, but we improve efficiencies as well.  After successfully delayering our international operationsduring the first half of the year, we transitioned the process to North America. Central to the new operating framework in North America is the creation of three business units: sparklingbeverages, still beverages and emerging brands, along with Glacau. To support our consumer leadership pillar, the new modeldefines roles in the organization and allows for greater clarity andaccountability for our priorities. As a result, we will be better equipped as atotal organization and as individual managers to win the marketplace and toclaim leadership with consumers, customers and bottlers.  In terms of the supply chain, we have made several initialsteps across the organization. As I mentioned earlier, as part of ourrestructuring in the Philippinesbottling operations, we're investing to grow our front end sales force by morethan 2,000 people as we take cost out of our supply chain to fund additionalcustomer-facing roles. Additionally, we announced initiatives to driveproductivity in our Irish concentrate operations, resulting in our plan toclose one of our concentrate plants. By executing lean productivityinitiatives, we were able to increase the capacity of our remaining twoconcentrate plants and remove the cost associated with the third plant. Efforts are underway to drive cost savings throughingredient and packaging harmonization, along with projects to optimizeprocesses for the most efficient production of our product.  Ultimately, we are building a productivity-based culturewhere employees feel engaged in the process. We are changing behavior acrossthe system and making productivity a core part of the way we approach ourbusiness every single day. As we reinvigorate the organization and realize theproductivity gains, we will selectively reinvest behind our three pillars todrive further top line growth.  In summary, I am very pleased with these results whichvalidate the progress we are making against our strategic agenda. Theconsistent, balanced results we are achieving are a culmination of the entiresystem working together seamlessly, which has been a key focus for us and isessential to our long-term success. The foundation for sustainable growth isbuilt and I'm confident that we will continue to deliver on our promises andcreate long-term value for our share owners.  Now let me turn the call over to Gary.\nGary Fayard:  Thanks, Muhtar andgood morning, everyone. As Neville and Muhtar indicated, we delivered anotherquarter of strong financial results. As you saw in the release, we reportedearnings per share of $0.71 on a diluted basis for the third quarter, anincrease of 15%. This included a net charge of $0.03 per share, primarilyrelated to restructuring charges, which was offset by a $0.03 per share gain,primarily related to the sale of a portion of our investment in Coca-ColaAmatil.  Therefore, after considering items impacting comparabilityin both the current and prior year, adjusted EPS for the quarter andyear-to-date increased 15%.  In addition, we lowered our expected underlying effectivetax rate on operations for 2007 to 22% from the previous estimate of 22.5% tobring the effective tax rate for the year in line with the current estimate, werecorded income tax expense at a rate of approximately 21.7% in the thirdquarter, which resulted in a tax benefit of $0.01 for the quarter. For 2008, weexpect the underlying effective tax rate to be between 22% and 22.5%. Net revenue in the quarter increased 19%, which included an8% benefit from structural changes related to our acquisition of bottlers.Excluding the impact of these bottler acquisitions, revenue growth was 11%,driven by 6% increase in concentrate sales, a 1% benefit from price mix and a4% increase from currency.  Price mix benefit on the core concentrate business waspositive in the low single-digits. However, this was partially offset bybottling investments, primarily due to the volume decline in Germany. We grew operating income by 10% on a reported basis. Afterconsidering factors impacting comparability in the current and prior years,operating income increased 12%, which includes a 3% benefit from currency. Soon an ongoing currency neutral basis, we grew operating income 9%.  SG&A increased 16% in the quarter, so let me take aminute to walk you through the increase. About 12 points of the increase weredue to currency bottler acquisitions and increased selling and service expensesin our consolidated bottling operations, and behind acquired brands as weinvested for growth. The remaining 4 points reflect continued solid investmentbehind our brands, and similar to our year-to-date results, G&A expensesincreased low single-digits, reflecting the early results of our productivityinitiatives and disciplined expense management.  So while the quarter's reported operating margins are 23.8%,this includes a significant impact due to the lower margin bottling operations,including the recent bottler acquisitions. Underlying margins on the corebusiness remain healthy as we drive top line growth and deliver operatingexpense leverage.  We repurchased $1.6 billion of our stock year-to-date and westill expect to repurchase a total of $1.75 billion to $2 billion for the fullyear 2007. Cash from operations year-to-date increased 18% on strongunderlying business performance and a decrease in working capital, primarily asa result of cycling the higher net taxes paid in 2006 related to therepatriation of foreign earnings from 2005.  Now let me address some of the factors that we see impactingthe remainder of 2007. We recognize that there is some uncertainty as itrelates to the U.S.economy. However, as Muhtar said, we remain committed to restoring growth inour home market. We continue to expect sequential improvement in our North America performance as we finish out 2007.  We also remain positive on the global macroeconomic outlook,especially in many of our emerging markets. We will continue to manage ourcountry portfolio as we expect solid performance in most of our markets. We feelconfident in our progress and have built a solid foundation strategically,operationally and financially as we finish out the year. Given the recent focus on commodity cost, I would like toprovide you with some insight into our point of view. In 2007 we have seenheadwinds across several key input costs. Globally, we have seen significantincreases in orange juice cost which we have effectively managed. The resulthas been year-to-date, mid single-digit unit case volume growth in our juiceand juice drink brands, while driving volume and value share globally.  The other significant commodity cost increases in 2007 havebeen in corn sweetener and aluminum, which was primarily impacting the North America bottling system and has been reflected in retail pricing.However, we are starting to see a moderation in commodity cost impactingbeverage companies, both globally and in North America,and we believe the worst is behind us. While commodity cost volatility remainsa risk, our current assumption is that commodity costs overall for the systemin 2008 will be essentially flat with 2007. For the company, we expectcommodity cost to be flat to down slightly versus 2007. From a capital expenditure standpoint, as we stated lastquarter, we expect total company net capital expenditures for this year to bein the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion as we make investments in recentlyacquired bottling operations.  Now let me move to currency. As I mentioned, we saw apositive impact from currencies for the quarter on operating income of 3%.Benefits from the euro, Brazilreal and sterling are being partially offset by weakness in the yen. We areeffectively covered for the full year on the yen and the euro. Based on currentspot rates and the expected impact of the coverage in place, we expect a midsingle-digit favorable impact of currency on the fourth quarter results.  We're in the process of finalizing our 2008 business plan,so we'll provide our outlook for 2008 on our year end call in February. That'sit for the topics I wanted to cover this morning, so we can now turn it overfor your questions. \nOperator:  Your first question comes from Christine Farkas - MerrillLynch.\n Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Can you quantify at all how much Glacau Infused added interms of basis points to your growth? In the past, water had been a drag interms of the larger volumes. Is that now cycling itself and no longer a factor?Thank you.\n Muhtar Kent: Certainly we have had a very, very good solid performancewith Glacau. It added about 2 points overall.  In terms of the bottom line, actually, we are very pleasedwith the North America performance, even without Glacau, it still had adouble-digit growth in the quarter. So that's basically how I would phrasethat.\n Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch:  And in terms of thewater?\n Muhtar Kent: Water, I think we're pretty much through the cycling.There's still a little bit of impact but nothing like in the first twoquarters.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS. \n Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Can you talk a little bit about productivity, and if any ofthat will fall to the bottom-line?\n Neville Isdell: Well, it clearly already is, because we had 1 point ofoperating leverage if you go down to the core business this quarter. Muhtarfocused on the really consistent drive that we have with regard to creating amuch more effective, a much more efficient system. You are going to see thatcontinuing, and it will evidence itself obviously in operating leverage, but itwill also allow us, where we selectively choose to do it, to invest behind thebrands and invest in terms of top line growth.  You see that virtuous cycle actually in this quarter, wherewe've got the operating leverage, we have reinvested behind the brands and thatcontinuing investment behind the brands drives the top line growth. That's thebalance that we'll continue to strike and we certainly see that continuinggoing forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Faucher \u2013 JP Morgan. \n John Faucher - JP Morgan: You talked about the flattish commodity cost as we head into2008. The question is, how does that impact your feeling on concentratepricing, given the fact that particularly with CC you took less net concentratepricing in 2007 because of the commodity environment?\n Neville Isdell: John, we're still obviously in our budget cycle and wehaven't finalized that at this point in time, so it's premature to speculate onthat. However, I would go back to the broader statements that I've made in thepast and that is that we will be increasing concentrate around about inflation,or slightly less. And also reflecting on the fact that as you look at thehealth of the overall bottling system and the recalibration that we have had todo really over the last seven or eight years, that we now have a very healthysystem so a more normal situation will prevail into the future. But it is tooearly for me to give you any real guidance on that for '08.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup. \n Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup: Unit case volume growth that you've reported this quarter,since your total worldwide volume growth you mentioned was up 6% and that wascertainly led by the international unit case volume growth which was up 8%, Ibelieve you mentioned North America was up 1%. I am quite frankly just simply trying to dothe math and understand how that works or where do I exclude the acquisition?\n Muhtar Kent:  We may have missed justthe beginning of your question, Bonnie, because there was interruption in the line. Tell me ifI haven't answered it properly. Internationally, as you said, we've grown 8%and in terms of both international as well as U.S.volume we're increasing still beverages double digits in both international aswell as in our North American operations. Overall, international we've grown 8%and in the U.S.we've grown overall 1%; that generates the average of 6% globally in thequarter.\n Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup:  I think you may haveanswered it. You're right, I just was trying to make sure I understood the mathcorrectly, Muhtar, because what you just stated, worldwide is up 6%,international is up 8% and North America is up 1%. \n Muhtar Kent: That's right. And in both operations we've increased stillbeverages double-digit growth in both international and North America.\n Neville Isdell: Bonnie, just to the other part of your question is how muchof that is acquisition? It's actually 1% on a global basis and 2% for North America. So the underlying North America is1, which is what you're looking for, I think, the plus 1%. Global is plus 6%and plus 5% if you exclude acquisitions.\nOperator:  Your next questionwill come from the line of Bill Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley.\n Bill Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley: Good morning, everybody. On North Americaas you're looking out to '08, do you see most of the focus on the integrationand continuing the momentum behind Glacau, which is going to be a bigundertaking for the system, or do you also see a strong innovation pipeline andefforts to improve the core sparkling business? You had had mentioned in thepast leveraging Glacau benefits to re-energize the core and you brieflymentioned some package innovation in your prepared comments.\n Muhtar Kent: Certainly Glacau is going to be a very important catalystfor sustainable growth in North America, and really,this new agreement is really a milestone with our bottling partners. Almostunanimous agreement with our bottling partners going forward, which iscompletely in line with our three key goals, which is leading growth insparkling beverages led by Trademark Coca-Cola, delivering our fastest volumegrowth in the still portfolio for North America; and being the preferred partnerfor our customers.  What this agreement has done is aligned our 2008 businessplan agreement and it's given us agreement on brand alignment, veryimportantly, for the next three years and it's also had very important impacton capability assessments going forward for reinvestment into our totalbusiness in the United States. Now having said that, our key focus is still to stabilizeand regenerate growth in sparkling beverages and you'll see us innovating bothfrom a package point of view and our three cola strategy is really workingwell, driving growth in the diet category and sparkling beverages and we willcontinue to focus on that. We will also certainly be coming out with a lot ofinnovation in packaging in also sales equipment as we move forward. A key focuson the point of sale going forward in the United States with our bottling partners wherewe're fully aligned for Q4 onwards.\nGary Fayard:  One other thing Iwould add, Bill, that I think gives us a lot of confidence in our statementsaround sequential improvement and winning in our home market is we have talkedabout in the past that we've been doing some tests around segmented executionand really ramping up those capabilities.  One of those is in Philadelphia.We've seen the results of that coming through this year and in fact in thequarter Philadelphia was positivein volume terms in sparkling. We know what we can do and have great confidencethat the entire bottler system can now execute behind what we're seeing andreally continue to improve our North America business.\n Bill Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley:  Great. So on that,you plan to take the learnings from Philadelphiaand extrapolate that out to the balance of the system?\n Neville Isdell: Yes, we certainly do. We have many plans around leveragingthe best practice out of markets like Philadelphia,as well as some other markets and drive that through across the system with akey focus, as I said, on execution at the point of sale and driving packaginginnovation at the point of sale. Just to give you the example of the grip bottle, which hasbeen a really important addition to our packing portfolio in the United States, it's already in 50 internationalmarkets and it's driving results across trademark Coca-Cola in all the markets thatit's been introduced and it's achieved about 75% availability already.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg - StifelNicolaus.\n Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: If you step back and look at the volume that this companyhas been producing, compared to what it might produce over the next year or so,if you take a mathematical view you could just say the compares are gettingtougher. If you take a qualitative view, you could say the momentum is reallypicking up here.  What in your mind, if you had to rank the key drivers of nomaterial slowdown and unit volume growth where we assuming you're managing themix as well as you have been, what in your mind ranks at the top here?\n Neville Isdell:  Mark, I wouldactually say consistency, execution and partnership with the global bottlers. Fromday one I have talked about executing for the long term and that that thenbuilds a momentum of its own. I also have said that don't judge us quarter byquarter, judge us over a period of time, because we will certainly havedifficult quarters. That happens.  Now, cycling the summer of '06 in Europe, wemanaged to be able to do that because of the strength of the rest of ourportfolio. You may recall that didn't occur when there was a very bad summer inEurope in '04, cycling a very strong summer in '03. So Ithink that underscores the fact that we have momentum and that momentum isgoing to continue.  It is broad-based. It is based on sparkling and the completereinvigoration that we have of the sparkling category. Muhtar has outlinedwhere we are with regard to that in North America andhow he feels that there will certainly be a recovery and we will have anabsence of the headwinds with regard to the cost pressures that we experiencedin '07 and '08 as well.  So I would really use the words consistency and continuingexecution, execution, execution. In a way, it's steady as she goes. There isnothing new we are going to say about a new initiative, it's all of the keydrivers of growth that we're going to continue to execute much better as we goforward and I think you see that happening with this management team as it hascome together very successfully.\n Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Coke Zero, you've got a level of detail globally we don'thave. The same question, obviously it's been an important contributor to growthbut there's real buy-in at the consumer level there. How do you think aboutthat brand as either a risk in terms of lapping or really continuing to act asa driver of growth?\n Neville Isdell:  I'll give you aheadline and let Muhtar give you some granularity. Every piece of evidence wehave is that that growth continues as we lap very successful launches. \n Muhtar Kent: We are now in more than 50 countries. By the end of the yearit will be close to 60 interms of launches. Everywhere, whether broad-based Asia,Latin America, Eurasia, Europeand North America, everywhere the brand is performingtremendously well, high double-digits. But I'll give you one piece of statisticthat may help you. If you take the total global Diet Coca-Cola and Coca-ColaZero volume, we have a double-digit growth versus prior year. The importantthing is that in most, in almost all markets Coca-Cola Zero drives a substantialamount of incremental volume. Of course, there is some cannibalization. But if you takethe two in terms of Coca-Cola Zero as well as Diet Coca-Cola and add the twotogether versus prior year, right now we have double-digits and very highrepeat and high velocity in all markets. So we expect this momentum to continuegoing forward and you can see that from our business where we're lapping,there's still tremendous velocity in the brand and horizontal expansion takingplace. That also is true for North America. We seetremendous potential right here in North America forfurther expansion of the brand.\n Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus:  So it sounds likeeven the oldest market you're seeing that double-digit relationship?\n Muhtar Kent:  Yes.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Lauren Torres -HSBC. \n Lauren Torres - HSBC: Solid results this quarter from some of your previouslytroubled markets. I guess that would be Japan,India and the Philippines.Outside of just cycling easier comps, can you talk about what's fundamentallychanged in each of these markets? I know, Muhtar, you talked about it in yourprepared remarks. Why should we expect some of this positive momentum tocontinue?\n Muhtar Kent:  Well first as afocus, the important thing is that we have now out of our top 22 markets, 19 ofthem are growing and growing with an increased momentum. That's the key. Wecertainly have had, as you put, issues around four large markets last year.Those were Japan,India,certainly Philippines,Nigeria and allof those are showing positive growth right now.  Now as I said, out of the top 22 markets 19, there's stillthree of them that are not performing. There will always be some in ourportfolio across 200 markets that need fixing. I can assure you that we focuson those religiously and with intensity and we fix them. You see all those fourmarkets today that were not performing that I mentioned to you now growing.  All of them had different issues. We had indicated a plan torestore, to stabilize Japan.I think we have stabilized Japannow. From here on we will continue to execute in Japanand it is a very high per capita market and we will return to traditionalgrowth rates in Japan. In the case of Philippines,in the case of India,in the case of Nigeria,they're emerging markets and we'll continue to drive our volume and gain sharein those markets.\n Neville Isdell:  Let me just add oneother thing which I think is important, because it comes from the wholestrategy of the formation of the bottler investment group. We now have veryskilled bottling professionals within the company and you see that in theresults in Indiaand the Philippines,where we are able to go into those sort of markets and very aggressively,particularly with the Philippines,turn around in a very short period of time.  Now, we have bottlers who are able to do that with marketsas well. But the strategic point is that what that does is it means that wetake a systemic view. We are able to think about the whole value chain, we'redoing that of course obviously when it comes to productivity as well. But we'vegot executives who now not only think about the concentrate side at theexclusion of the bottling side or vice versa, we now have a total systemicview.  When you're able to do that and link that togethereffectively, that's when you get the execution and that's when you get theresults. So that move has given us the intellectual capital within the businessto be able to execute the way we are doing and to be able to execute rapidly.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane - Banc ofAmerica Securities.\n Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities: I just wanted to ask a question about productivity and Iguess the potential to start thinking about increasing the co-mingling of beerand soft drink distribution in some markets. If my memory is correct, this hasbeen a platform that's been in and out of favor at Coke over the years. But itappears like there's a few markets where that is effective right now and Iwould like to get an update on your current thinking, if it's changed at all asto whether or not that's a viable option in terms of creating some leverage insome markets around the world.\n Muhtar Kent: Bryan, let me just firstly just say that our strategy and effortsaround productivity are to ensure that we have a realigned organization thatcan make decisions with speed, that we can drive value in key spend areasacross our organization on our system, build the foundation for sustainablegrowth going forward in key processes and then of course the culture piece.  In some exceptional situations, there may be distributionand there may be synergies in the back office. But clearly, we are focused toensure that we have exclusive management of the market development at the pointof sale across the world and this is critical for us. Developing outlet byoutlet, impulse creation across the world and that requires an exclusive focus. So our thinking is very clear. Where there may be someopportunities on an exceptional basis, I think the bottling system finds those.It's not a strategy that we look to develop across the world from here andcertainly our strategy on productivity are those that I've outlined to you.\nOperator: Your final question comes from Mark Swartzberg - StifelNicolaus. \n Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Muhtar, a quick question on Glacau North America. Anydifference in the contract, the distribution contracts you have with CCE versusother Coke bottlers?\n Muhtar Kent: No. Essentially we have, as I said, an agreement, really Iwould call it a historical agreement, almost unanimous participation by all ourbottlers that essentially focuses on the areas that I've already outlinedbefore. It is the same with distributors.\n Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: It's the same across distributors?\n Muhtar Kent:  Yes.\nNeville Isdell: Thank you very much, indeed, everyone. Thanks Muhtar andGary. Just to conclude, it's good to be with you again this morning. I justwant to reflect on the fact that for decades the Coca-Cola Company, we've stoodfor positivity, we've stood for happiness. One of the things I feel as I walkaround the corridors, the halls in Atlantaand also in our field locations, because we all spend a lot of time out therearound the globe, is that our employees are engaged and just as importantly,they're having fun again.  So I'm confident that our strategies are working. We remainresolute about delivering against our strategic agenda in order to continue tocreate sustainable growth and value for our shareholders.  Thank you very much indeed."}, {"symbol": "KO", "quarter": 2, "year": 2007, "date": "2007-07-17 12:32:06", "content": "\nExecutives"}, {"symbol": "KO", "quarter": 1, "year": 2007, "date": "2007-04-17 13:20:52", "content": "TRANSCRIPT SPONSOR :\nExecutives: Ann Taylor - VP, Director, IR   Neville Isdell - Chairman, CEO   Gary Fayard - EVP, CFO   Muhtar Kent - President, COO \nAnalysts: John Faucher \u2013 JP Morgan   Bill Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley   Robert van Brugge - Sanford Bernstein   Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities   Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus   Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs   Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch   Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup   Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS   Lauren Torres - HSBC   Matthew Riley - Morningstar   Ann Gurkin - Davenport \nOperator: At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Coca-Cola Company's first quarter 2007 earnings results conference call.

I am going to start this morning with a few brief observations about the quarterly results, and Muhtar will then provide details on operational achievements, and Gary will follow with an overview of the financials and he\u2019s going to give you some additional perspective on the Philippines as well.  What you see today is a very strong quarter, delivered by a company and a system that has found its footing, regained its focus and come a long way in retooling its operations. While there is much more that we can and will do, the Coca-Cola Company is today proving that we can meet the commitments that we make.  We said that we would drive growth and profitable brands in packs and channels, and today we are reporting revenue growth of 17% on worldwide unit case volume growth of 6%, our highest quarterly volume growth rate since 2002, while cycling 5% volume growth for the first quarter of last year. We also said that we would maximize our local brand footprint to leverage our sweet spot in the industry. Today we are reporting international growth of 9%, which is our highest quarterly international growth rate since 2000.  We also said that we would grow our core sparkling beverages whilst expanding the footprint of our still portfolio. Today, we are reporting an increase of 5% in sparkling beverages, led by 4% growth in trademark Coca-Cola. That growth includes the rollout of Coca-Cola Zero to 20 additional markets including Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and France amongst others.  Still beverages increased 9%. The solid growth resulted in share being gained or maintained in key nonalcoholic ready to drink categories, including sparkling, bottled water, juice and juice drinks, sports drinks, and ready to drink tea. So, for the quarter, we've delivered on our commitments.  Now I'd like to give you a new commitment. We will win again in our home market. It will not come quickly and we continue to expect 2007 to be weak, but we do expect to begin seeing sequential improvement in the second half of the year as we execute against our key goals.  Muhtar will address this topic in more detail in a moment, but I want to underscore my absolute focus on North America. We delivered strong financial results this quarter, even with this decline in North America. Strong top line growth resulted in ongoing currency neutral operating income growth of 11%, which is ahead of our long-term growth targets.  The geographic sources of profit growth were, in fact, more balanced as well. Additionally, we delivered solid operating expense leverage, even as we continued to invest to support our brands and build capabilities within our own company-owned bottling operations. Certainly a strong performance to start the year.  So now, let me turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Muhtar Kent, who will provide you with more details. \n Muhtar Kent: Thank you, Neville and good morning, everyone. It has been just over 120 days since I assumed my new role. What I would like to cover this morning are my key priorities for 2007 and relate those to our performance in the quarter, as well as expectations for the remainder of this year. These priorities are designed around a simple strategy: continue to innovate, take smart risks, and work closely with our bottlers to drive growth in sparkling and still beverages.  The first priority is to sustain and drive progress in our international business. Second, address the issues in North America, where I've been spending a great deal of time these past four months. Third, increase productivity across the organization and drive leverage on the P&L. Fourth and last, compress and accelerate the commercialization rate of innovation and best practice sharing.  Let's start with the first one, sustaining and driving progress in our international business. Our quarterly results clearly display the strength of our global portfolio and our ability to execute across the entire system, with most of our key markets delivering solid performance. We will continue to build on these results by growing our core sparkling beverages, expanding our still offerings, and executing with precision.  Unit case volume growth was again led by our key emerging markets including China, Russia, Eastern Europe, Southern Eurasia, South Africa and across Latin America. Also, some of our emerging market weak spots from last year continued to rebound as India and Nigeria both delivered solid results for the quarter.  In addition -- and equally encouraging -- is the strength of some of our more developed markets. One of our most consistent performers, Mexico, increased unit case volume 2%, cycling 8% in the prior year on the strength of trademark Coca-Cola driving total sparkling beverage share gain. This is the third consecutive quarter of improvement in Japan, with unit case volume up 3%. Although cycling a 2% decline from prior quarter, the performance across brand portfolios is particularly encouraging and demonstrates the changes we put in place last year. The strategy we are now pursuing there is really paying off. Solid growth in trademarks Coca-Cola, Fanta, Sprite, Enviga Green Tea and Aquarius drove the results, with each gaining share.  The European Union increased unit case volume 11%, as all operating divisions delivered mid single-digit or better growth. I am encouraged by the growth particularly in Europe in Germany and Western Europe, which continued to show progress.  As expected, our business in the Philippines continued to face challenges and experienced declines in the quarter. However, we are taking a number of critical actions to address these issues. At the end of February, we completed the acquisition of the bottling operations in the Philippines previously held by San Miguel Corporation. The bottler will now have full access to the expertise of our management, as well as be fully integrated with our company's overall objectives. With a robust business plan being implemented and an experienced management team in place under Irial Finan\u2019s leadership, the leading share position and strong brand metrics, we believe we are well positioned to return the Philippines market to its former standing as one of our top performers. During 2007, as our program gains traction, we expect to see sequential improvement in unit case volume and return to growth in 2008. Gary will provide more details on the financial impact on 2007 in a moment.  The success in our international operations in the first quarter directly reflects our ability to build on the progress we made in 2006. We've delivered 8% organic growth in sparkling beverages, led by 7% growth in trademark Coca-Cola. This is the highest growth in trademark Coke in international operations since 1998. In fact, sparkling beverages have averaged 6% growth over the past five quarters, confirming our belief that sparkling beverages have not matured, but rather still have great potential. Coke Zero and our new grip bottle, properly directed marketing initiatives such as the integrated activation of the Coke Side of Life at Coca-Cola.com, and efforts to win at the point of sale are prime examples of how we will use innovation and our close partnership with our bottlers to develop marketing campaigns that drive growth.  In addition, we continue to expand our still beverage footprint around the world. Internationally, our still brands increased 16% in the first quarter by leveraging our existing trademarks and successfully integrating our recent acquisitions to improve our offerings to customers and ultimately to consumers. For the E.U. group, still beverages increased 36% and even excluding acquisitions, still increased solid high teens. Our juice and water platforms continue to gain strength with the expansion products such as Minute Maid into India, the pending acquisition of Jugos del Valle in Latin America, and the acquisition of Apollinaris in Europe.  Success requires a robust and rational portfolio. We continue to evaluate all of our options and when necessary, we will selectively make acquisitions for additional speed, scale, as well as capability. A large competitive advantage for us, of course, is our relationship with our bottlers and the strength of our distribution channels. We've seen solid progress in our company-owned bottling operations, which in terms of volume is now the second-largest bottler in the world. The back to basics approach, an improved in-market execution can clearly be seen in our results in Germany as well as in India, amongst many other places.  Now let me focus on my second priority, which is to reestablish consistent growth in our home market, North America. The first quarter results were weak, as expected, and we are clearly not satisfied with the 3% decline in volumes. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do, but certainly there are signs of improvement.  In the first quarter we demonstrated our commitment to driving growth in trademark Coca-Cola as we activated solid campaigns for Coca-Cola Classic, Diet Coke, and Coke Zero. Integrated campaigns for all three brands included events television advertising linked to retail activation. We returned to the Super Bowl with the Coke Side of Life, to the Oscars with Diet Coke, and most recently built our presence with the NCAA basketball tournament featuring Coke Zero, and of course, our sponsorship of American idol continues to feature all three brands. Our campaigns are creating consumer awareness. Coke Zero continues to gain share, reaching a 1.2 share during the quarter. Diet Coke showed positive growth in the quarter and gained share while Coca-Cola Classic also gained share.  The next round of innovation you will see in the second quarter is the introduction of Diet Coke Plus, our first venture under the Coca-Cola trademark for a sparkling, calorie-free beverage with vitamins and minerals. In still beverages for North America, we continue to make progress in our areas of focus. Trademarks Disani, Minute Maid, Simply, Oswalda and Power-Aid each gained category share.  In teas, while volumes increased by double-digits, there is significant opportunity to improve and we have begun to reset our business. Our recent agreement with Nestle to refocus the DPW joint venture increases our flexibilities in the tea and coffee categories in North America, which we are pursuing vigorously. We're very excited about our recently announced acquisition of Fuse, which includes a variety of tea, juice, and other enhanced beverages and further rounds out our expanding still portfolio.  Overall, we remain totally committed to winning in North America and have an active plan to address the business issues. We are focused on building our system execution capability by developing working relationships with our bottlers based on cooperation and collaboration.  We anticipate continued weakness in 2007, though, the first half of the year. In the second half of 2007, we expect to see sequential improvement and evidence of progress as we execute against our key goals, which are leading growth in sparkling beverages driven by trademark Coca-Cola, delivering the fastest value growth in still beverages, and being the preferred beverage partner for our customers.  Now let me turn to productivity. A very important component to our success in North America as well as around the globe is ensuring we increase productivity. We are delayering and simplifying our structure so we can improve our speed of execution and improve leverage. This will enable us to better align the architecture of the organization to the three pillars that are the core drivers of our top line growth: consumer marketing, commercial leadership and franchise leadership. This is a targeted effort to enable the organization to be more effective, efficient and to remove bureaucracy.  All of our efforts center around avoiding waste and removing distractions that cause us to lose focus on the three pillars mentioned above. These initiatives will result in some cost savings, but importantly will improve clarity on decision-making which will allow for more time to be focused on revenue-generating activities.  Other efforts are longer term and involve driving system efficiencies. There are projects around the global supply chain and common IT platforms. The bottlers have already been doing an excellent job in many respects and it can be seen in the improvement of their returns. We've already experienced success in global procurement of key commodity inputs as well as in Japan with the supply chain management company, where we are using those lessons to build similar models in China and Mexico, particularly as we gain scale in the still beverages. But there is still significant room for improvement across our entire system. As we reintegrate the organization and realize the productivity gains, we'll selectively reinvest behind our three pillars to drive further top line growth.  My fourth priority is compressing the innovation pipeline. This really gets at our speed to market. Our organization has never lacked for innovative ideas. What we've lacked is a discipline to commercialize expeditiously. We are focused on doing fewer things and doing them better. A clear example has been the global success of Coke Zero, which will reach 40 markets representing 75% of total trademark Coca-Cola volume by the end of 2007.  But we are taking a broader view of innovation. It's not just simply product formulations, it also includes such things as the new Coca-Cola grip bottle, which will be available to over 50% of the world's population by the end of 2007; the Coke Side of Life campaign, which will be in over 200 markets; we're using M&A to augment scale and capabilities, for example with Fuse here in North America. It's also brand, price, packaging and channel optimization that we are jointly developing with our bottling partners. And, it is the way we're working with our bottlers to agree on long-term plans for profitable system growth and equitable value share.  While I've identified four distinct priorities, my goal for the year is to deliver on our business plan by driving sustainable top line growth and leverage in the P&L.  In summary, both Neville and I are pleased with the solid start to 2007, but we are not satisfied. While we're moving in the right direction, we still have a lot of work to do. Neville said it best at CAGNY: the opportunity for Coca-Cola as the only truly global beverage company in a growing beverage industry remains significant. Having sustained solid growth in sparkling beverages internationally, we have proven that there is still opportunity in sparkling beverages and our global still portfolio is just beginning to develop.  We have a focused and effective strategic agenda, supporting a renewed confidence in delivering against our long-term growth targets. We know there will be bumps, but with a new culture of innovation, improving speed to market, and maintaining an outward focus, I am certain our work will create long-term sustainable growth and value for our shareholders.  Now, let me turn the call over to Gary Fayard. \n Gary Fayard: Thanks, Muhtar and good morning, everyone. As Neville and Muhtar indicated, we are starting the year with a strong financial performance. As you saw in the release, we reported EPS at $0.54 for the first quarter, an increase of 15%. This included a net charge primarily related to an asset write-off in the Philippines from the Philippines bottler, partially offset by gains from the sale of an ownership interest in one of our Brazilian bottlers and from real estate in Spain. Therefore, our adjusted EPS was $0.56 per share, an increase of 14% after considering items impacting comparability in both 2007 and in 2006.  We attribute about a penny of the EPS to timing of concentrate shipments, as concentrate sales growth was slightly ahead of reported unit case growth in the quarter, primarily due to Easter being a little earlier this year.  Net revenue in the quarter increased 17%, that included a 5 point benefit from structural change related to our acquisitions of some bottlers. The growth was also driven by a 6 point increase in concentrate sales, 3 points from currency and 3 points from price and mix benefits.  We grew operating income by 17% on a reported basis, after considering items impacting comparability in the current and prior year quarter, operating income increase 14%, which includes a 3 point benefit from currency. So on an ongoing currency neutral basis, we grew operating income at 11%.  SG&A increased 13% in the quarter, so let me take a moment and walk you through that increase. About 8 points of that 13 point increase were due to the bottler acquisitions, and that is from increased selling and service expenses as we invested for growth in bottling operations, and due to currency. The remaining 5 points we continued to invest solidly behind our brands, and control G&A expenses as we continue to focus on productivity and expense management.  In the quarter, we repurchased approximately $676 million of our stock; as a result, our average shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2007 were approximately 45 million shares lower than the average in 2006. We still anticipate that a range of share repurchase in 2007 will be between $2.5 billion and $3 billion.  In terms of dividends, the board raised the quarterly dividend for the 45th consecutive year by 10% to $0.34 per common share, which is an equivalent $1.36 per share on an annual basis.  Now let me address some of the factors that we see impacting the remainder of 2007. We remain relatively positive on the macroeconomic outlook for the remainder of the year, especially in many of our emerging markets. We will continue to portfolio manage globally, as we expect solid performance in most of our markets with weak performance in North America, particularly in the second quarter as we cycle stronger volume and profit results.  As with the first quarter, we would again expect our consolidated bottling operations to be a positive contributor, as we continue to build world-class operations. As for the acquisition of the Philippines bottler, you should think about it really in two buckets. First, we took a charge this quarter for the write-off of bottles and cases in the Philippines bottler. Second, we expect full year EPS results to be reduced by $0.02 as we invest to return the Philippines bottler operations to growth. Most of this impact will be reflected in the bottling investments group.  Capital expenditure requirements will be slightly less than $100 million and will take the total company capital expenditures for 2007 up to about $1.6 billion. For 2008, we do not expect the Philippines to have any impact on consolidated results. In 2009, the operations should start contributing to growth. That and the impact on 2008 would include covering the interest cost from the acquisition.  As for items below operating income in the P&L, I'd like to remind everyone that we still expect net interest costs to increase primarily due to lower cash balances and higher debt balances due to share repurchase, acquisitions such as the Philippines bottler, dividends, and capital spending.  Also keep in mind that equity income will be negatively impacted by our reduced ownership position in Coca-Cola Fimsa and our Turkish bottler as well as selling our equity interest in one of our Brazilian bottlers this quarter.  With regard to taxes, we ended the quarter with an underlying effective tax rate of 23%, and we would expect to remain at that underlying effective rate for the remainder of the year.  Let me move to currency. As I mentioned, we saw a positive impact from currencies for the quarter on operating income of 3%. That was in line with our expectations. We continue to put coverage in place and are now effectively covered for the full year on both the yen and the euro. Based on current spot rates and the expected impact of coverage in place, we expect a small positive impact from currencies on full year 2007 results.  Before I close, I wanted to remind everyone about the 8-K we filed with SEC 2 weeks ago containing the additional segment detail for the two new operating groups, Eurasia and Pacific. Please go to our website and pull the information down to assist in your modeling.  Those are the topics I wanted to cover this morning, now we can turn the call over to your questions. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of John Faucher \u2013 JP Morgan. \n John Faucher - JP Morgan: Good morning, everyone. I wanted to follow-up a little bit on the price mix line, which came in very nice this quarter. Can you give us a little guidance in terms of with the change in concentrate pricing from what we can see from a CCE standpoint in terms of looking at plus 4 and then net it down to zero, can you talk a little bit about how that's going to work out financially and what goals you have in place for CCE in that regard?  Can you also give us an idea on the mix side in terms of how we're seeing some of the bottler case mix, is that a positive which is offsetting some of the negative country mix? How should we map that out over the balance of the year? Thanks. \nGary Fayard: Thanks for the question. Let me take price mix first. What you're seeing is 3 points of price mix. About 2 points of that is coming from the core, and 1 point is an impact from bottling operations. That price mix is really from I'd say the quality of our growth with very strong sparkling beverage growth as well as very balanced growth across the world, particularly EU, Latin America, Japan. You're seeing positive mix come through, country mix come through even with an offset from North America, as well as the quality of that growth with a strong sparkling beverage growth. \n Muhtar Kent:  Yes, essentially in those numbers, the U.S. concentrate price is already included embedded in those numbers and, essentially we've also had very good benefits in Latin America from pricing as we drive revenue growth management across all of the markets, as well as in the EU. \n John Faucher - JP Morgan: CCE had talked about meeting certain goals to get the concentrate pricing netted down to zero. Is that showing up in the price mix line, or is that showing up in the SG&A line if you are in fact netting the concentrate pricing down? \nGary Fayard:  John, it's showing up in the price mix line. \n John Faucher - JP Morgan:  Even with that, assuming that CCE's meeting their targets, even with that you're still putting up high quality growth there on the price mix line? \nGary Fayard:  That's correct. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Bill Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley. \n Bill Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley: Good morning, everybody. Muhtar, you had mentioned some productivity benefits as one of your goals. You mentioned delayering, indirect procurement, supply chain. Can you quantify any of this or talk about the timing in terms of what kind of funds would be available for reinvestment?  Also with the recent meeting you had with the bottlers in China, I guess supply chain was one of the topics. Can you help us all understand what was discussed with the bottlers at that meeting? \n Muhtar Kent:  You need to think of this activity this ongoing activity, Bill, in various buckets. The first is the architecture of our organization, with the primary purpose of that being really delayering and ensuring that we have speed, better focus, less bureaucracy, much more improved time in terms of our execution. That, of course, will yield some savings. We're in the process of analyzing what we do with those savings and how we reinvest, how much we reinvest, and how much we actually put to our bottom line in terms of leverage. I can't quantify any further. The international piece of that work is completed. We're completing some further work on that in North America.  The second bucket is some of the other productivity work that is going on at the moment in the Company that is related to our indirect cost inside the total Coca-Cola Company. Gary and his team are leading that work stream.  The third piece is the whole area of longer term supply chain initiatives for the entire system, which is a much bigger number and there's different buckets of work going on across the world in that area. If you look at it in three groups, that's as much as I'd like to say on that right now. \n Neville Isdell: If I could just build on that, you'll see that there is operating leverage coming through in this quarter. We believe you'll continue to see that. If you go back to when we did not appear to have operating leverage, really it was the 2005 $400 million reinvestment back into marketing. If you look at our top line growth, you can see that clearly has worked, adding the fuel to the brands.  So, just echoing what Muhtar has said, you can create operating leverage in two different ways: you can keep your expenses flat where they are and push the top line by reinvesting some savings; that's one way we're looking at it. But you've got to be sure that you've got effective programs. We think we've got those effective programs in the works right now. Also, of course, there will be some that will actually just naturally flow down to the bottom line, as well. You'll see that evolve in the quarters ahead. \n Bill Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley: The recent meetings in China with the bottlers, how would you characterize them? \n Neville Isdell:  First of all, the headlines very positive. Muhtar was talking about improved bottler relations in his earlier comments. Obviously their numbers -- if you look at the international bottlers -- are improving. They have a strong belief in how we're moving forward. We spent quite a lot of time sharing some of the innovations for the future. I think we're bringing the bottling system in line with us.  Obviously, we are focusing on execution, which is their side of the bargain and something that clearly they agreed they have to improve upon. The other piece of the other bucket that Muhtar talked about -- we spent a lot of time on that -- which is what we can do systemically in order to improve the overall health of the system as a whole. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of Robert van Brugge - Sanford Bernstein. \n Robert van Brugge - Sanford Bernstein: In connection with your increased incidence rate in Mexico, you had agreed with your bottlers increased marketing spending this year. So far in the first quarter, the margin trends are still pretty much consistent with last year. Are we starting to see this increased marketing spending in the P&L at this point? \nGary Fayard: Yes, and you're right. When we increased the incidence rate in Mexico, we also agreed that we would increase or spend back some of that incidence increase in marketing as well as the creation and exploitation, if you will, of the still portfolio in Mexico. You are seeing us do that; that is happening. The marketing, remember, is on a sales curve. So it's curved over the full year, but there is an increase in marketing in Latin America. That includes the impact from the increased incidence. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities. \n Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities: Muhtar, a couple of questions relative to North America. Going into this year, pretty high expectations in terms of retail pricing. I'm just curious to know your assessment so far in terms of price elasticity. Has volume responded more or less in line with where you thought it would be?  Looking forward, what are your expectations on how you'll monitor that and whether or not there's going to be a need to maybe act in terms of moderating price increases? \n Muhtar Kent: Although we have not been happy at all with the results for the first quarter for our North American operations, essentially they are actually slightly better than our expectations and what we had in our budget. What we see is generally, of course -- and particularly the sparkling category overall as well as in segments like orange juice and juice-containing beverages \u2013 are very large price increases, but we see also in the retail environment the actual elasticity and actual demand elasticity for our products based on individual packages has been generally in line with expectations; what we've expected based on those price increases. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus. \n Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Muhtar, a question for you regarding Japan, nice to see another quarter of positive volumes there. Georgia seems, relatively speaking, a little better positioned than it was a year ago. Nonetheless, it looks like margins are going down in that market for you. You're spending more there.  Is that a fair assessment? How would you characterize the competitive environment and the retail environment across your portfolio, not only for the ready-to-drink coffee, but your total portfolio? \n Muhtar Kent:  Well, I think what I'd like to say is on Japan, six of our core brands grew double-digits in Q1, and we've strengthened the core by refocusing our commitment. Sokenbicha tea remains a strong brand, delivered good volume growth; and trademark Coca-Cola has shown stabilization and has actually grown now with The Coke Side of Life campaign, and more to come in that area. In general, I think we're happy with where we are with our stabilization and return to growth in Japan.  As far as coffee is concerned, the core brands of coffee grew. What is also very encouraging in Japan is that in the entire quarter our vending machines and our entire vending segment has grew, which is also very important for our margins. Essentially we are focused, we are spending in the market, and we believe that our sequential improvement in Japan is going to continue. \n Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus:  Great, that's helpful. Just to close that thought on the spending side. When you think about the level of spend today, perhaps on a per case basis versus a year ago, 18 months ago versus looking forward, how do you feel about that number? There's been a step up investment. Do you see it stepping up further? \n Muhtar Kent: I don't see any significant changes compared to 12 or 18 months ago, overall. There may be some timing in there, but I don't see anything materially changing there. And I think we're at the reasonable rate right now. I don't see it going up any further.  I think the critical thing is that our entire bottling system is in a much different place, it's energized and everything else we're doing for productivity in the market is working; and the growth, of course, is the key to everything. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs. \n Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Good morning. I'm wondering if you can update us further on your tea strategy going forward, both in U.S. and outside the U.S. given the changes to the BPW joint venture? Particularly North America, if you look at your tea portfolio, whether this is a category where you may need to be more aggressive on the acquisition front? \n Muhtar Kent: First, just two sentences on the BPW. As you know the BPW arrangement has been recast and now essentially it's for all teas across the world with the exception of Japan and now North America; and also coffee, both sides are free to do what they want in the area of coffee.  Now, let me focus on tea. BPW arrangement with the Nestea brand has been successful in many, many markets and will continue to be successful in many, many markets around the world. USA was one market where we believed we were not winning in tea, we needed more flexibility, and we are intent on winning in tea in the U.S. market.  The results so far in the last two years have not been acceptable, are not acceptable and we are going to win in tea. We cannot afford not to win share in tea and we cannot afford not to grow ahead of the market in a very big category that is growing in the United States. That's the objective of all of the exercise that we've gone through. You will see us refocusing what we have in our portfolio with Nestea, with Gold Peak, with Enviga, with other brands as well as looking at new opportunities in the market in rapid fashion. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch. \n Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much. Good morning. Muhtar, you talked about brand, pack and price architecture internationally and how that's successful. In looking at North America, can you point to what the real efforts are here in North America? Is it squarely focused on go to market strategy? Or is the brand pack price architecture something that has to be aligned more quickly? Thank you. \n Muhtar Kent:  Both. Go to market strategy is critical as well as the BPPC architecture is critical as we move forward in order to ensure that we have revenue growth activities, management in the marketplace, and that we align consumer needs and the consumer better to our brand price pack and channel architecture in the United States. There's going to be a lot of activity in that area, including simple things like redesigning some of our labels to look more attractive. Looking at the entire merchandising sets by channel from convenience stores all the way into retail and different parts of retail and how we can generate further impulse in the marketplace, which has all worked and continues to work very favorably for us in Latin America, across Eurasia, and across parts of the EU.  The test in Denver that we've had, we're doing some tests in Denver with CC and successive tests are actually showing that it's a simple architecture, but it works. It works very effectively. \n Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Your corporate expenses, is there any investment in that line for overall system productivity at this stage, or is that a good run rate in terms of year-over-year growth? \nGary Fayard:  Within the Corporate expense line, there's slight investment in productivity, investments for system initiatives, but it's primarily just kind of year-on-year growth. Underlying the G&A expenses, underlying in corporate, in fact, we're below our budgeted rate so we're really focused on holding those expenses. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup. \n Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup: Good morning, everyone. My question is for Muhtar and Neville. It's quite clear you're not satisfied with the business in North America. I'm curious, when you look out over the next several years, is there some concern that this could be a leading indicator in any way, shape or form? Either the consumer here in North America, the way you go to market, the products? If so, because I know we're different all around the world, how do you try to prevent that? Or is it the reverse? Are you really trying to, again, incorporate the best practices that you mentioned, Muhtar, in trying to fix North America? \n Neville Isdell: Let the non-American here start first. I don't think there's any fundamental difference. After all, it's what happened in America that built the business around the world. There are a number of issues facing us at the moment. The headwinds of the pricing are clearly the major headwind that we have with regard to sparkling beverages.  There's also this whole issue of commitment and belief. And you heard me say, you heard me at CAGNY about around the world people looking at me when I came back, when I said we'll get sparkling beverages growing again, with a level of disbelief. Obviously the pricing headwinds have held back North America. But I and Muhtar were with a number of bottlers over the last week. They have a belief that what we have coming along the pipeline, Diet Coke Plus now, what's happening with Coke Zero, et cetera that we now have the tools to actually replicate what we've done in the rest of the world in North America, whilst building out our still beverage portfolio. So I don't think there's anything exceptional about the United States.  Remembering that you'll see the same sort of sticker shock in the Hispanic community, a lot of them who were immigrants who were consuming the product in other parts of the world. So the headline for us is that there is sticker shock here, but number two, that we have the consumer marketing which is working. We also have the bottler commitment in terms of franchise leadership. I think if you talked to the bottlers you'll feel a whole new level of confidence and a commitment in terms of the operational side of what is needed.  John Brock has said that one of the things that he's picked up is there are lessons from around the world that we need to pick up in North America and I think that's a very good sign. Muhtar, do you want to build off that? \n Muhtar Kent:  Yes, just to refocus again on the consumer, connecting with our core consumers and industry with well received creative and highly rated messaging. You saw examples of that in the Super Bowl, NCAA, Oscars, improving the performance of Coke Zero and Diet Coke which are actually significantly, significantly outperforming the sparkling category. My Coke Rewards program, now over 4 million members. Again, connecting with our chief consumer target base.  On the commercial leadership, we are aligned. I repeat, we are aligned with CCE on segmented merchandising, which is part of the BPPC architecture and a rollout of that. It's going to cover about a fourth to maybe even a third of our large source supermarkets by the end of this year. Agreement also with CCE to build total beverage account team, again a very important, significant area in commercial leadership.  Then also on franchise leadership, the third pillar, again, aligned beverage growth agenda with all of our top to top bottlers. So again, with specifics on product innovation, we've mentioned Diet Coke Plus, but there are many others in the area of packaging, in the area of how we create impulse at the point of sale.  Then we've reorganized our United States business along the lines of our international business to focus on the three core pillars, focusing on sparkling, focusing on stills, and focusing on new and emerging markets; we have put very experienced people against all those three areas.  The other important thing is you walk around the U.S. market, Bonnie, you walk around the U.S. market and we've lost the drive to create impulse. That's what we're bringing back. No signage. The whole signage program for the world started right here in the United States 30, 40 years ago. Now you walk around Latin America, you walk around Europe, you walk around Asia, you walk around Africa everywhere you have signs that say ice cold Coca-Cola served here, not in the United States. That's creating the impulse, again back to basics and we know we can do it.  So it's both. Bringing best practices from outside and then leveraging the power of the category, which is bigger than anywhere else in the world here in the United States. Doing both at the same time. \n Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup: That was very helpful. So in terms of timing, you're thinking by the end of this year, will it take you maybe until early next year to do a lot of what you said? Because it all sounds great. \n Muhtar Kent: I don't want to comment any more on the timing. I think you see our sense of urgency. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS. \n Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Good morning, everyone. To the extent that you beat your top line growth algorithms, what impact could this have on your future CapEx? Potentially does it limit any increase in your cash return to shareholders? Also can you talk about the macro economic backdrop in some of the developed markets like Western Europe and Japan and how this may have helped results? \nGary Fayard: Relative to CapEx, it should not have any real impact on CapEx, actually, because most of our CapEx is in some of the finished products businesses in North America, some of the bottling and bottling investments, which are really kind of not permanent investments for us. No change in business model. I don't see much change in CapEx.  Relative to dividends, we've been very consistent and have been increasing dividends at a pretty good clip over the last few years. So we would expect to continue to see dividend increases. Again, an annual decision that we'd be looking at the end of this year, but have a dividend policy in place for this year.  Relative to macro economic trends, Muhtar, do you want to comment on that one or Neville? \n Neville Isdell:  I'll pick that up. There is a broad optimism you've seen what the OECD is saying, what the World Bank is saying. I think that global growth is going to continue at the rate that we've seen over the past couple of years for '07 and through into '08. That's really reflected in our plans.  The one that you still would query, I suppose, would be Japan. I think we're cautiously optimistic about that country coming out of stagnation and given the importance of Japan, together with the actions that we're taking in the Japanese business which are becoming apparent in terms of being successful, we are becoming more bullish but cautiously optimistic, I would put it, about Japan. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Torres - HSBC. \n Lauren Torres - HSBC: I was hoping you could talk a bit more about product build outs, maybe even more importantly the potential for acquisitions in North America. Obviously we heard about your acquisition of Fuse. I was just thinking about if we should expect similar deals in the works. Basically, how are you thinking about internally developing brands in the U.S. versus acquiring brands? \n Neville Isdell: Developing brands let me pass that to Muhtar in a second, but we really don't comment on acquisitions. I still stay with what we've said all along that we're going to do both. That would be largely bolt-on. But opportunities come up, and we evaluate every opportunity and look to see whether that is the right way to build our portfolio. Muhtar made the comments in his remarks that that's what we would do. Buying is sometimes the right way.  What we have is an innovation pipeline coming along where we are building and building at a rate that we have not been building in the past. Even if you look at patents that we're getting registered in terms of new benefits that we could add to our own beverages, you'll see that in the innovation pipeline.  Muhtar, would you like to talk about just about what's coming down to the pipe from the build side for North America? \n Muhtar Kent:  There's no question, we have some clear winners. We've mentioned Coke Zero, the Simply trademark is really a great winner. We're excited about Vault, the recent launch of Vault Red Blitz, with a huge immediate consumption focus. Energy continues to gain share in this competitive category against our principal competitor as well as against the market, the flavored waters. You'll see us doing a lot of critical extensions. You'll see us being more active in the area of ready to drink coffee.  As we said, we launched Coca-Cola Cherry Zero in the quarter. You'll see more extensions around Coke Zero, the success of Coke Zero leveraged to more extensions. Diet Coke Plus and what the implications that has for some of the other products. You'll see us again developing and leveraging Fuse. We feel it's a huge opportunity.  So those are just some of the ideas that I want to share with you in terms of how we feel about building internally. Enviga is another one. You'll see us again being active in the area of tea, Gold Peak. Those are just some of the things that I can highlight to you what we feel in terms of both what's in our innovation pipeline and how we intend to quickly commercialize and build internally as well as strategically add on any bolt-on acquisitions. \n Lauren Torres - HSBC: I guess it would be fair to say that your bottlers are encouraged by the pipeline coming through? \n Muhtar Kent:  If you talked to them, I believe that's what they would say. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Riley - Morningstar. \n Matthew Riley - Morningstar: I was hoping you could address the labor issues the Coke system seems to be facing in North America. Whether this could lead to trouble executing the turnaround you anticipate in the North American market? \n Neville Isdell:  Well, the issue is one that is with CCE. We don't want to comment on what our bottlers are doing in terms of a potential labor dispute. I think the evidence that you've seen in the past is that we have a very capable bottler that is certainly able to handle these type of issues very effectively with their unions. Clearly there is some discussion around issues at the moment as they restructure. I would anticipate that sensible people will be able to come to sensible solutions. \nOperator: Your final question will come from the line of Ann Gurkin -Davenport. \n Ann Gurkin - Davenport :  Good morning. Two things. One, can you talk about the strategy for Powerade in the U.S. in terms of pricing and marketing? Secondly, I believe at CAGNY you talked about pushing into or developing volumes in emerging markets and your strategies in terms of using existing bottlers, acquiring bottlers, or using JVs in terms of distribution? \n Muhtar Kent:  Yes, let me take the one on Powerade. Essentially, we've gained volume as well as value in Powerade and we continue to be cautiously optimistic in terms of the category and also the competitive position of Powerade. You will see us accelerating Powerade in retail channels this year. The Powerade option expansion is an example of that, the NCAA commercials and so forth. So certainly we feel that there's runway ahead of Powerade and that it will gain, continue to gain traction as well as competitive advantage.  As far as the question you asked about international. Basically, I've said it before. As we expand our portfolio across the world, whether it's Latin America, Europe, Asia, the traditional models that we have worked with for the last 100 years, 120 years may not always be best uses for developing fast, quickly our business in these noncarbonated and particularly juice and juice-containing beverage categories. And in those areas where we are trying out some new models with our bottling partners that are more close to what we call JV models and based on sharing of the opportunities and sharing of the investments as well as equitably sharing the value created rapidly in those segments. That's basically what I'd like to say. Does that sufficiently answer your question? \n Ann Gurkin - Davenport :  Yes. Are you raising prices on Powerade in the U.S.? \n Muhtar Kent:  I don't really want to comment on that right now. But if you looked at the Nielsen numbers, you won't see that happening. \n Neville Isdell:  Thank you, everyone. Thanks Muhtar and Gary. I want to just emphasize to all of you who joined us this morning, that this one quarter is a strong start to the year. We are continuing to build off the successes that we saw in 2006. So we do have consistency, we do have momentum. I am confident that our strategies are working.  As I've mentioned in every quarter since my return, execution and maintaining an outward focus on our customers and consumers are critical for our success. That consistency you're going to see continuing. We continue to remain focused on the long-term health of the business. Again, I've said that since day one, everything we're doing is looking at building this business for long term, sustainable growth and therefore building value for our share owners. Thank you very much, everyone. Good-bye. \nTRANSCRIPT SPONSOR :\nCompany sponsors its own earnings call transcript:\nCompany sponsors partner's transcript:\nCompany sponsors competitor's transcript:\nIssuer-sponsored research firm sponsors client's transcript:\nInvestment newsletter sponsors transcripts of successful stock picks:\nIR firm sponsors transcript of micro-cap company:\nConsulting company sponsors company's transcript in sector of interest: Your company's name and promotion could have been on this transcript!

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce Jackson Kelly, Vice President and Director of Investor Relations.\nJackson Kelly: Good morning and thank you for being with us today. I'm joined by Muhtar Kent, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Gary Fayard, our Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks this morning by Muhtar and Gary we will turn the call over for your questions. Before we get started I'd like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report.  In addition, I would also like to note that we have posted schedules on our company\u2019s website at www.thecoca-colacompany.com under the Financial Information tab in the Investor section which reconciles certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to by our senior executives in our discussion this morning and from time to time in discussing our financial performance as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. Please look on our website for this information. Now let me turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: I am pleased to report that we have delivered another quarter and year of strong financial performance. This marks our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable EPS growth and the third straight year of meeting or exceeding our long-term growth targets. Our results reflect the hard work and dedication of our global system through this incredibly challenging economic environment. Together with our bottling partners we are assertive and flexible in terms of managing our business, focusing strategies, accelerating actions, redirecting investments, and being prudent with our capital and other expenditures, while maintaining a disciplined long-term approach to our operations. Our performance for the quarter and full year underscore our firm belief that there is no better business to be in than non-alcoholic commercial beverages. In a challenging environment we added another billion incremental unit cases in volume, essentially another Japan, our fifth largest volume market. We firmly believe our industry will continue to experience growth across all categories and geographies as macro population and person expenditure trends still highly favor the simple moments of pleasure we bring to our consumers over 1.5 billion times a day, a cent at a time. Strong, decisive execution based on focused strategies enabled us to deliver continued global volume and value share gains across key geographies as well as categories. As we all manage through these globally challenging times, volume and value share gains will continue to be critical benchmarks for our performance progress. We remain on track to deliver $0.5 billion in annualized savings from productivity initiatives by 2011. The continued acceleration of these efforts are going to enable our cash to be re-deployed to drive investments for sustainable growth. And there is no question that this year will pose unique macroeconomic challenges for all businesses. That said, we are not content to just ride out the storm, rather we will leverage this as an opportunity to further build the equity of our brands and drive value for our system and customers. Our highly skilled management team has navigated through a very difficult operating conditions around the world before and is well equipped to run our operations in these challenging times. I\u2019m confident that our solid brands, as well as our business fundamentals, coupled with a sound balance sheet, robust cash generating model, and strong bottling partners spread across all five continents, provide a sound foundation for our management team to continue delivering against our long-term targets this year and position our company and our system to become even stronger over the long term. Looking at this past quarter and year, we delivered 4% unit case growth for the past quarter and 5% unit case growth for the full year of 2008. Our international operations again led the way with 6% volume growth for the quarter and the full year. In close, close collaboration with our bottling partners, we are building from a strong competitive position with share that is three times that of our nearest competitor to drive continued, solid international growth. This growth was well balanced across the entire globe as each of our five geographic operating groups outpaced the industry for the year, resulting in consistent top- and bottom-line performance. By any measure, we continue to believe these are strong results. We credit our performance to a consistent set of strategic initiatives.  Now I would like to take you through some of the progress we have made against those strategic initiatives. First, drive growth in sparkling and still beverages. Sparkling beverages are the very oxygen of our business, as I\u2019ve said many times. Unit case volume for sparkling beverages grew 2% for the full year with our international performance up 4%, representing incremental growth of 0.5 billion unit cases last year. Full year global performance was driven by Coca-Cola, up 2%; Coca-Cola Zero up 35% with nearly 600.0 million unit cases sold; Sprite, which became our third trademark to reach 2.0 billion unit cases in annual volume, was up 6%, led by countries like China and India; and Fanta, driven by innovation, was up 3%. Coca-Cola continues to be the brand that consumers love most around the world with a three-to-one favorite brand preference versus our global competitor. Our Olympic sponsorship is a great, great example of how incremental investments have an exponential impact on building the global equity of our powerful brands. During the most successful Olympic activation in our history, we connected with more than 0.5 billion consumers in China and were cited by many as the most recognized and effective sponsor of the Beijing games. Also, we are continuing to build on the heritage as well as the incredible global appeal of our flagship brand with the recent launch of our new worldwide Open Happiness campaign. This exciting new integrated marketing campaign is the next generation of the Coke Side of Life and stays true to Coca-Cola\u2019s 123-year heritage, while opening new doors to connect with consumers around the world in a relevant and timely manner. Again, this year our ads rated highly during Super Bowl, and importantly, Open Happiness will be leveraged globally with launched in most of key markets by mid-2009. Importantly, we gained sparkling beverage share globally for the quarter and the year across most of our key global markets. Our still beverage unit case volume increased 13% for the year, driven by strong growth in existing brands and several strategic brand acquisitions. Internationally still beverages were up 17%. Still beverage growth across each of our operating groups drove category volume and value share gains globally. Leading the way were gains by Vitaminwater and our global juice, tea, coffee, as well as energy brands. Our strategy to build on the world\u2019s strongest juice business continues to succeed. Minute Maid Pulpy, already a huge success in China, is being expanded to several other key international markets. Here in North America our multitude juice strategy continues to outperform the category and drive share gains. The Simply trademark is quickly approaching billion-dollar brand status. Our Latin American acquisitions are providing growth and scale to drive efficiencies for our bottling partners. In 2008 we continued to innovate with new brand launches such as the successful Original Leaf Tea in China. We are also leveraging our partnership with Illy and launched this ready-to-drink coffee in ten markets in close collaboration with our bottling partner Coca-Cola Illy.  Glaceau, led by Vitaminwater, remains well on track to become a $2.0 billion trademark through continued volume and value share gains and we have several new product innovations in store for this year. we grew Glaceau double digits in the quarter as well as full year in the U.S. while expanding this great brand to five international markets in 2008. And finally, better marketing focus drove performance for our critically important Georgia coffee brand in Japan. Unit case volume for Georgia grew 2% for the year in 2008, driven by 9% growth in key core Georgia flavors. Before I move on to a summary of our geographies, let me briefly touch on two innovations that many of you will get to experience at the upcoming Cagney Conference next week in Florida, one in ingredients and the other in equipment. In 2008 we announced two significant advances. First, the introduction of products sweetened with Truvia, an all natural non-nutritive sweetener. We have already launched several products, two new Aguila flavors along with Sprite Green, the first sparkling beverage enhanced with this break-through sweetener. Also we are announcing the launch of Vitaminwater Ten, the perfect combination of ten naturally-sweetened calories and great taste. Second, last September we unveiled our breakthrough fountain dispensing technology that empowers consumers to select from over 100 branded beverages in the same footprint as our current six-valve fountain. Through unique design and micro-dosing technology this is surely something you will want to try first-hand at the Cagney Conference next week. These are just two examples of how the Coca-Cola Company is applying new thinking and new ways of quickly leveraging our R&D investments across our global operations. We continue to leverage our geographic footprint in over 200 countries where our three-fold strategy is focused on: first, leveraging our share leadership position for profit in developed markets; second, driving value as we achieve scale in developing markets; and investing for volume growth in the emerging markets. Let me share a few highlights from some key markets. In Japan we delivered our largest unit case volume year on record, successfully cycling 3% growth in the prior year, resulting in non-alcoholic commercial beverage share gains. We continue to invest in our three-cola strategy and this investment paid off with the 5% growth of sparkling beverages during the year, led by trademark Coca-Cola. Europe grew 3% for the year, cycling 5%, continuing our successful efforts to gain share in both sparkling and still categories. Continued expansion of Coke Zero was strong in European marketing platforms such as our 007-Bond activation and the Christmas activation on Coca-Cola drove our sparkling beverage growth. And in Latin America, which is a great example of how we achieved scale in a developing market very rapidly. We delivered solid balanced growth with all Latin America business units delivering mid- to high-single-digit unit case volume growth and share gains for the year. Coca-Cola increased 4% and still beverages increased 40% as we continued to leverage the regionally important [Kuka Staballa]. In Russia, unit case volume increased slightly for the year, primarily the impact from unseasonable weather during the summer and economic pressures at year end. Despite the slowdown of volume growth in Russia, we gained volume and value share in non-alcoholic registered drink beverages in the quarter and full year. The fundamentals of our business in this key market remain very strong.  In Turkey, one of our leading emerging markets, we increased unit case volume 11% in the quarter and 15% for the full year as we benefitted from the strength of our brand portfolio and solid execution by Coca-Cola Bishkek, our bottling partner.  Importantly, in our 120 countries with per caps less than 150, our volume growth was 9% for the year, cycling 11% in the prior year. We continue to believe we are early in the game in key emerging markets. To that end, this past year we grew volume 19% in China and 14% in India, the two fastest growth economies in the world.  While China is clearly expecting slower GDP growth this year, we are confident in our plans to ensure our brands as affordable consumers\u2019 favorites continue to offer real value to Chinese consumers during these difficult times. During 2009 each of our operating groups will continue to execute against our strategies and focus on delivering consistent results. We will continue working closely with our bottling partners in these challenging times to adapt to conditions on the ground and better meet the needs of our consumers, as well as customers. In North America, we along with so many other industries, are facing some of the most challenging economic conditions in the world. However, we made real progress last year. In what is arguably the world\u2019s most competitive beverage market, I am pleased that our brand portfolio is getting stronger, our customer relationships are improving dramatically, and we have a more aligned and capable bottling system. The continued success and enduring investment in this progress is enabled by a relentless ongoing focus on cost management and productivity. The fundamental measurement of our results is brand health and share gains. Clearly, the volatile economic environment and bottler price increase impacted our results, however, it is important to recognize we outperformed the industry. When measuring across all channels, we gained volume and value share in the quarter and the full year. In fact, the Coca-Cola Company owned five of the top ten fastest growing trademarks in incremental retail sales in North America for 2008 with Coca-Cola Zero, Glac\u00e9au, Simply, Nos, and FUZE. And our system also handled half the volume of the Monster trademark, given us access to a sixth brand. Real and tangible progress is being made in strengthening our aligned with our bottlers, as illustrated by strong customer teamwork across our system. We have a rigorous portfolio effectiveness and efficiency initiatives with our bottlers as we move forward. These actions are ongoing and we expect will drive incremental gains and long-term profitability for our system in North America. Our marketing and innovation calendar for North America is robust with numerous activities across the portfolio. As the economic environment strengthens, we believe our continued investment in our brands, customer and franchise relationships, will enable us to return our sparkling brands to growth and accelerate continued growth in our still brands. Before I turn the call over to Gary, let\u2019s just step back and review what makes the Coca-Cola Company\u2019s model so special. First, we have some of the best brands in the world and the cash flow to keep investing in them to build long-term equity with our consumers and customers. Second, our invested capital generates high returns. Simply said, we were built for times like these. The Coca-Cola system generates up to $50.0 million of cash per day. Our fundamentally sound balance sheet allows us to pursue growth and we have demonstrated the ability to deliver a reliable dividend which has increased each of the last 46 years. We enter 2009 with the same mindset as one year ago: deliver on a consistent set of strategies and initiatives that provide us a disciplined road map to operate in the best consumer business in the world, a business with significant long-term opportunities. We have a tradition of delivering growth over the long term and it is our intention to continue to drive long-term balance to sustainable growth for the benefit of our shareholders. Our picture of success this year is clear. First, maintain simplicity by focusing on a critical set of measurable deliverables. Second, increase the speed and efficiency of execution to capitalize on opportunities while mitigating risk. And third, remain constructively discontent in all that we do in order to deliver against our long-term growth targets and enhance our long-term brand and system health. With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary.\nGary P. Fayard: As Muhtar indicated, we once again delivered strong financial results in the quarter, resulting in our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable EPS growth and our third consecutive year of delivering against our long-term growth targets. We continued with our disciplined approach to financial management using our many business levers, consistent volume, solid price mix, improving operating expense leverage, and disciplined capital allocation to deliver value customers, consumers, and share owners, even in this difficult operating environment. Our management\u2019s effort to diligently execute our strategies and work with our bottlers to adapt to the marketplace is a testament to the resilience of our business model and the talents of our employees. We reported earnings per share of $0.43 per quarter on a diluted basis in the quarter, however, this included a net charge of $0.21 per share. $0.15 of the net charge was related primarily to our proportionate share of the non-cash impairment charge recorded by Coca-Cola Enterprises. The remaining $0.06 of the net charge was primarily related to asset impairments, restructuring charges, and costs related to our global productivity initiatives. Therefore comparable earnings per share was $0.64 per share, an increase of 10%. For the year, recorded EPS was $2.49. Comparable EPS was up 17% to $3.15. The net charge of $0.66 per share primarily related to non-cash impairment charges recorded at Coca-Cola Enterprises in the second and fourth quarters as well as asset impairments, restructuring charges, and costs related to our productivity initiatives. For the year unit case volume growth was 5%, essentially in line with concentrate sales. Revenue growth was 11% as we balanced the volume and value equation by delivering a 4% increase in concentrate sales, a 3% favorable impact from price and mix, and a 4% currency benefit for the year. Full year comparable operating income was up 17% as our productivity efforts have begun to pay off and includes a 6% benefit from currency. Again, ahead of our long-term targets. Importantly, our advantageous geographic diversity played a key role with each of our international operating groups contributing to our profit growth for the year. In terms of margins, our core business remains healthy, expanding margins for the full year as we drove top-line growth and delivered operating expense leverage. Bottling investments continues to improve margins as well. In the fourth quarter you will have noticed that we delivered significant operating expense leverage. We do not expect to achieve that Q4 leverage in 2009. Rather we would expect the run rate for 2009 operating expense leverage to be more in line with our 2008 full year results. Our productivity initiatives remain on track to deliver $500.0 million in annual savings by year end 2011 and we are accelerating efforts to rewire the organization to support our next era of growth. Cash flow from operations for the year increased 6% to $7.6 billion on strong underlying business performance. But you may have noticed that working capital was a $700.0 million year-over-year use of cash. The working capital change was primarily one-time international tax payments which will reverse in 2009 and cash payments related to restructuring charges and our costs incurred for productivity initiatives. Excluding these items, cash from operations increased 13%. As part of our ongoing productivity initiatives we will continue to focus on managing our working capital in 2009. We repurchased approximately $1.1 billion of our stock for the full year in line with our prior guidance. Additionally, the company paid $3.5 billion in dividends to shareholders in 2008.  Our balance sheet remains fundamentally strong with solid interest coverage ratios and a conservatively invested cash position of $4.7 billion. Now let me address some of the factors that we see impacting 2009. First, let me reiterate Muhtar\u2019s sentiment, there is no question that the coming year will pose macroeconomic challenges for all businesses but we will not be content to just ride out the storm. We will leverage this as an opportunity to drive our business for the long-term and build on our track record of success. We have continued to evolve and improve our operational and fiscal discipline while building on our solid foundation with consistent strategic priorities. Our seasoned management team is poised to continue to do so in 2009. As you know, our long-term currency-neutral growth targets are 6% to 8% operating income growth and high single-digit ongoing earnings per share growth. Our picture of success for 2009 is to achieve those targets as well as enhancing brand health and gaining share despite the difficult operating environment. Additionally, we will track share gain across all of the key markets and categories. On concentrate pricing we will continue to work in alignment with our bottlers to adjust our occasion, brand, price, pack, and channel architecture to bring value to both our customers and consumers. As always, our intention is to take pricing in line with our bottlers net retail pricing over the long term. As in the fourth quarter, our revenues will continue to be impacted due to structural changes primarily related to disposal of bottlers. We would expect a similar drag during a portion of 2009 as we cycle the sale of the re-milled bottler in Brazil at the end of Q2 and the Pakistan bottler investment at the end of Q3. We expect to deliver operating expense leverage on both the core business and bottling businesses in 2009. We will continue to invest behind our brands and innovation initiatives. Additionally, selling and service expenses will increase as we invest for growth in our bottling operations as well as investments behind our band acquisitions, particularly in North America. G&A expenses were tightly controlled in 2008 and we will continue with our disciplined approach in 2009, including further progress on our productivity initiatives. As for our pension plan, we remain on fairly solid ground, however, we were impacted by declines in the value of plan assets and a lower discount rate. As a result we would expect pension expense to increase $0.03 to $0.04 per share in 2009 as compared to 2008. From a capital expenditure standpoint, we purchased approximately $1.8 billion in net property plant equipment during 2008. For 2009 we would expect the total company net capital expenditures to be approximately $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion as we continue to make investments in our business as well as recently acquired bottling operations. For share repurchase, we do not plan to repurchase additional shares in 2009 due to the pending acquisition of Huiyuan Juice Company in China. Now let me move to currency. As expected, currency has proved to be a headwind in the fourth quarter, impacting comparable operating income by a negative 9%. As for our 2009 currency outlook, it is obviously a very volatile environment and there are no clear trends for the U.S. dollar. As we are all observing, the market\u2019s risk perspectives continue to evolve and may move to mute the attractiveness of the dollar as the year progresses. However, there are many different scenarios that could play out and we are managing against this backdrop. We are effectively 100% hedged on key hard currencies like the Euro and the yen for all of 2009, but emerging market currencies continue to be particularly volatile and provide the highest risk and opportunity for our currency expectations for this year. Base on our current hedge position, we are expecting an estimated 10% to 12% headwind from currencies in the first quarter and will provide further updates as we progress through the year. It is important to note that we manage our business in local currency to ensure we make the right decisions for the long-term business health.  For 2009 our best estimate is that the full year underlying effective tax rate will be approximately 23% to 24%, up from the rate of 2008 largely due to the impact of currency. Finally, let me say a few words about quarterly phasing. As many of you know, we report quarterly unit case volume growth on an average daily sales basis to eliminate comparability issues due to calendar variations. For 2009 we will have one fewer day, since 2008 was a leap year. first quarter of 2009 will have five more days than Q1 2008 and the fourth quarter of 2009 will have six fewer days versus Q4 2008. This will not impact our unit case sales reporting but will impact our concentrate sales and therefore revenues. Additionally, both Easter and the impact of July 4th U.S. holiday will shift into Q2 this year. We expect 2009 will be a challenging but successful year. We continue to be a consistent generator of operating cash flow providing attractive, long-term returns to our shareholders. Well, that\u2019s it with what I wanted to cover this morning. We are ready for questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: Muhtar, can you speak to the volume strength that we saw in fourth quarter in a lot of the international markets? And if you can go through whether this is really driven by the category being very resilient in the face of the economic downturn or you\u2019re just maybe gaining more share in those markets. And then, as we look out at 2009, you talked about the picture of success in 2009, meeting your long-term targets, does that apply to the volume targets of 3% to 5% as well?\nMuhtar Kent: The answer to the first part of your question is both, the resilience of the category. As I said many, many times, we are selling moments of pleasure billions of times a day. More than 1.5 billion times a day, a cent at a time, and our bottling partners have been continuing to invest very heavily on the ground in equipment, with the customers in the past two or three years, and I think that\u2019s paying off. We had a balance growth. Our developed markets like Europe grew as well as our emerging markets and Latin America grew. Eurasia and Africa grew very well. The brick markets, particularly India and China, had a very strong quarter in the last quarter of last year. So I think overall we have had a very strong quarter.  As far as going forward, we recognize the challenges, our picture of success still remains to meet our long-term growth targets, but we have said we will have bumps along the road. And we may not achieve our targets in one or two quarters, that is possible. But our picture of success remains to continue to drive investments, to ensure that we are investing in the health of our brands, and to ensure that we gain market share as we have done this past year\u2014this past quarter and this past year\u2014and to come out of this tunnel with stronger portfolios, strong brands. And one thing you will not see us doing is that we will not cut our communication with our consumers. We will continue to invest with our bottling partners. Our bottling partners\u2019 appetite for investment remains very strong around the world and that is a very good litmus test of what\u2019s happening in the marketplace with our system.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: In relations to that, we have seen media rates coming down pretty substantially. Is there an opportunity to kind of look at the marketing expense line and get more leverage and maybe flow some the more productivity savings to the bottom line in this environment where the media spending is trending down?\nMuhtar Kent: Well, even when media costs were not trending down, we were achieving significant efficiencies in our marketing. We have much fewer agencies that we are working with. We have consolidated our agencies. The Coke Side of Life campaign was leveraged all across the globe as will be the Open Happiness campaign. The new Open Happiness campaign agency numbers have gone down by more than half and I think we have driven a lot of efficiencies in our market research costs, in our marketing, over the past 12 months. That will continue and we will evaluate the cost of media but ensure that our GRPs remain very healthy in the way that we communicate with our consumers across the world. And I have personally seen, in Russia, where I have live through these crises in the past in the 1990s and in Turkey, Argentina. It\u2019s always paid off to ensure that you keep communicating with your consumers in macroeconomic conditions as the ones that we\u2019re living through right now.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: Gary, is there any transactional impact that we should be aware of beyond that 10% to 12% impact in the first quarter you talked about. And if the reason you\u2019re not giving the full year currency guidance is just volatility in the emerging markets currency and really the full year depends on where these currencies go from here through the end of the year?\nGary P. Fayard: That\u2019s exactly right. 10% to 12% impact on the first quarter at operating income is kind of what we see today for the quarter. But you\u2019ve seen the volatility as well as we have and I think to try to give guidance on what currencies could do for the full year is impossible. Because of these swings. I think long term there is no doubt in my mind that the dollar is going to weaken. For many reasons.  But right now obviously it is a safe haven, it\u2019s why the feds is looking at adding four new primary dealers for Treasuries right now because of everybody going to safe havens. But at some point it\u2019s going to turn. We just don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to turn.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Marc Greenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities.\nMarc Greenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities: Muhtar, I was hoping you could elaborate on something. Expense management in the quarter was terrific. Can you talk about longer term how you can increase investing to drive brand growth and at the same time get expense leverage? Beyond some of the comments to Judy. I guess I\u2019m thinking about the sustainability of lower SG&A into 2009.\nMuhtar Kent: Firstly, I think what we want to say is that over this year and 2009 you should be guided by our full year expense leverage from last year. So 4% to 5% opex leverage is what you should be looking at for 2009 and that is going to be achieved through our continuing successful transformation process. As you know, we started that process way ahead of the current macroeconomic downturn. It\u2019s been going on now for more than 12 months. We have already captured significant effectiveness and efficiency and productivity and we will continue to drive our target of $0.5 billion by 2011, recurring.  And I think that is a combination of effectiveness and efficiency in our process and our systems and how we approach our business and also it is being driven by the whole new architecture that we have in our organization that we put into place at the end of 2006 in our international markets and North America continues to drive also a lot of effectiveness and efficiency inside their own transformation process. And this is all outside of the supply chain efficiencies and effectiveness that we are also beginning to tap into.\nGary P. Fayard: I would just add a little color on that and I am going to give you a little granularity because as we are going through rewiring our company for significantly enhanced effectiveness, what we\u2019re getting is a lot of efficiency as well. And let me just give you a really granular example. In finance itself, global finance within our company, we have been going through and starting to rationalize the companies we own and the legal entities. So when we do a consolidation each month or each quarter, we consolidate about 1,200 entities. We have gone through and last week have found 112 of those that we can eliminate, another 200 that we can probably eliminate, and if you just think about, there are people spending many, many hours doing work on legal entities that actually don\u2019t need to exist, that have just been around for years, that there was a reason for in the beginning. It goes to how do we do inter-company accounting. We are in granular detail of how we wire and rewire the company to be significantly more effective and we will be a lot more efficient at the same time. So we are very confident that we\u2019re going the right way and doing the right things for long term and getting short-term benefits while we\u2019re doing it.\nMuhtar Kent: One other point I want to add is that we always talk about the money side of it. I think the piece I would like you to really focus on also is the organization now that we have in place, as a result of the work that we have done, is executing with much greater speed and effectiveness and mitigating risks as it goes along. And I think that\u2019s the piece that is also very important. We are much closer to the marketplace today, much fewer meetings, much more time in the marketplace with our bottling partners, with our customers, and that\u2019s really also a significant advantage of the transformation process, in addition to the actual monetary side of the effectiveness.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Faucher - J.P. Morgan.\nJohn Faucher - J.P. Morgan: Gary, the capex has risen and you talked about investing in companies and company-owned bottlers. It\u2019s a little bit of a change from how we have historically thought of capex at the Coca-Cola Company. So how long do you see this higher capex trend continuing and as you begin to divest more bottlers does it have less of an incremental impact year-over-year?\nGary P. Fayard: If you look at, like I said, about capex last year and in 2009, $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion for 2009, about half of it or so is actually related to the bottling investments group or the bottlers that we own. My expectation, as you saw, in 2008 is over time we will be net sellers and as we actually sell bottlers, the capex will come down fairly significantly. The capex is really being driven right now because as we continue to invest in China and the Philippines and Germany and those bottlers, and really invest in India, investing in cold drink equipment, those kinds of things, to drive volume, value, across the long term, we think we\u2019re doing the right things for the long term in those, but capex will start coming down significantly over the next five years, if you will, as we are disposing of some of those bottlers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala \u2013 UBS.\nKaumil Gajrawala - UBS: As you consider this economic slowdown in emerging markets and the fact that a good percentage of your portfolio is the premium ready-to-drink offering, to what extent are you considering affordability in these markets and what would you do to address it?\nMuhtar Kent: I think we are always ensuring that our products are affordable, we have the right price pack architecture and we are doing a lot more work on ensuring that we have the right price points in this current environment, adding more packages that will bring the price point down, both in the at-home market as well as in the immediate consumption market.  And we\u2019re not doing that only in emerging markets. We are doing it across the world, in North America, right here, with really good initial results in terms of the new price pack channel architecture. With 16-ounce and some other smaller packages. And so as well as places like Mexico, to ensure that we are much more a part of the new location and we increase pantry. And so what we have seen in this environment is that it is really working well in terms of driving the pantry at home, creating more occasions in this environment, and whether it\u2019s in China or whether it\u2019s in Great Britain. In China we just launched a new 355 ml PT that\u2019s doing, initial results are very good, just to give you one example. So I think across the entire geography, across all continents, we have done a lot of work in the past four or five months in that area.\nKaumil Gajrawala - UBS: With media deflation, are you maintaining the budget and increasing impressions or maintaining the number of impressions and just enjoying some efficiency?\nMuhtar Kent: I think we are doing all of the above and it\u2019s too early to say where it\u2019s going to pan out. One thing you can be sure of is we are not going to reduce our weight and we will capitalize on the current market trends.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Christine Farkas \u2013 BAS-ML.\nChristine Farkas \u2013 BAS-ML: I\u2019m looking at a couple of your mature markets, North America and Europe and you talked about unusually high leverage in the quarter and maybe you can speak to this on a more normalized basis, but the margins were quite strong. Are some savings coming through from the $500.0 million program already? Was this about market allocation timing of where you put your dollars in the quarter? And then within those regions, speak to the strong food service trends and what countries worked or didn\u2019t work in Western Europe.\nMuhtar Kent: Basically I think as far as Europe is concerned, I think we have had a lot of initiatives for Pan European programs over the last 12 months and I think they have really started working well for us in this environment. So we have got a lot of efficiencies, and they are sustainable efficiencies. Across the whole company and across our headquarter\u2019s functions, we have started to reap some of the benefits already of the transformation process. We have got a lot more coming. And again, in terms of, there is a tremendous focus on G&A across the whole company, and particularly opex. And what we\u2019ve said is this is the time to be choiceful about how we spend our money and anything that basically does not drive value does not have a place. So we have certainly also launched a lot of products with better margins in Europe. New teas, new smoothies, that has brought some efficiencies effectiveness on the P&L line, in our European business. In North America, a lot of work is going on in effectiveness and efficiency. Part of the transformation process but also the work that is ongoing with our bottling partners in the supply chain and then some other areas in order to drive again some leverage on our P&L. In terms of food service, we are cycling (3%) from Q4 of 2008 which was the beginning of the economic downturn. And I think that, again, we have launched some new products in our food service in Q4, some new teas, some new coffees and smoothies. And I think basically all the investments that we\u2019re doing with all our customers are paying dividends.\nChristine Farkas \u2013 BAS-ML: Was Germany positive in the quarter?\nMuhtar Kent: Basically we would prefer not to comment on individual countries but I would just basically say to you that overall, key markets like Great Britain, France, were positive and I think all the programs that we have in Germany are paying dividends. And 2009 is going to be the first full year of consolidation in Germany when we will get really, the results of all the good work that\u2019s being done. We\u2019re gaining traction in Germany.\nGary P. Fayard: Let me add one thing to your Europe question, and I don\u2019t know if this is where you were coming from but I know I picked up a few comments earlier this morning about Europe and I think a lot of people perhaps thought currency was a really significant tailwind in Europe in the fourth quarter. We had some hedge coverage in place, so let me just kind of give you a little bit on that. Currency for Europe was a negative 8, so if you look at that versus what you are expecting it to be, you may find that there is a little bit of difference as well because of our hedge coverage.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Lauren Torres \u2013 HSBC.\nLauren Torres - HSBC: Yesterday Coke Enterprises spoke about their strengthening relationship with you and the formation of Coca-Cola Supply. I was hoping you could just give us a little bit of your thoughts behind this organization, what are your expectations. How should we gauge and monitor the progress that\u2019s developing in this new relationship.\nMuhtar Kent: I think basically we are very serious about our efforts in Coca-Cola Supply and I think we have got a very good program in place in terms of the new integrated supply chain initiative that will consolidate the common supply chain initiatives. It will optimize product flow and create over $150.0 million of annual incremental operating income by 2011 for CC and the Coca-Cola Company. I think all our other bottling partners are going to benefit from that. It is a very serious initiative.\nLauren Torres - HSBC: Is there anything we\u2019re going to see or should expect to see over the course of this year? I know we\u2019re talking about the savings through the next couple of years but as far as the immediate impact, just something somewhat more material that we will be seeing coming through?\nMuhtar Kent: I think you can look at it similar to the transformation initiative that we announced over 12 months ago in our company. Basically you can expect that the 2009 plan will deliver an aligned outcome for both companies, the Coca-Cola Company as well as our bottling partners and certainly a more progressive agreement for the future. I think that we will wrap up everything as best as we can and we have a very good plan forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: When you look, particularly at your emerging market businesses, and even to an extent your developed market businesses, can you talk a little about some of the assumptions you are making about key macro trends unfolding? Obviously they are getting worse but I\u2019m particularly interest about how you\u2019re thinking about inflation and other key variables affecting the broader environment you are operating in.\nMuhtar Kent: Well, what you have to do is absolutely remain flexible because it\u2019s changing so fast. We don\u2019t right now, I think immediate there is no threat of inflation but over a period of time there is no question with all the amount of money that\u2019s being printed around the world, no question that we need to make some planning ahead. We may be facing an inflationary environment but we certainly don\u2019t know when that will when, if that will happen, and where it will start or how it will evolve. All I can tell you is that we have lived through those inflationary environment in the past and our businesses really, we have great operating talent across the whole world that have operated in that environment, whether it be Latin America, in Eurasian countries and we will certainly be looking at what\u2019s evolving and we will remain very flexible as well as ready for anything that comes in that area.\nGary P. Fayard: I would add one thing about inflation. If you go back and look at history, any time we really enter into an inflationary environment our company actually benefits. We do extremely well in that type of environment.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Some interesting comments out of Diagio this morning describing at least parts of their emerging markets business as having not only the better growth but perhaps the most enduring growth. When you look at your own business and think about volatility and risk of slowdown and magnitude of slowdown outside of the U.S., what do you consider your markets that are most vulnerable to slowdown, just from a macro perspective? Hearing what you all can do to defend against that is I think pretty persuasive, but what do you kind of put at the top of the list as your most vulnerable market? If you have to put something up there.\nMuhtar Kent: Certainly we talked about Russia. Russian has been hit in a different way and earlier than some of the other markets and we have certainly seen the results of that slowdown on our business, too. Our volume growth has slowed down. Philippines was one of the other markets that\u2019s been hit significantly earlier than the rest, in terms of the macroeconomic situation and in terms of the remittances that were driving a lot of the consumption in that economy came down. And we have seen the impact of that.  And no question that there are some Latin American markets that are beginning to feel the United States more, like Mexico. We know that the GNP in India and China is not going to be the same as it was in the past 12 months, it\u2019s going to be slower but there will be growth. The Chinese prime minister reiterated the objectives of his government to ensure that they grow at 7% to 8% last week and announced more details of their stimulus package, which is very real. And I think all governments, across the world, are launching, in their own way, different stimulus packages whether it\u2019s tax cuts, investment incentives, supporting small and medium size enterprises. So across the world there is a tremendous effort that we are seeing by a lot of governments, by central banks, to ensure that the macroeconomic downturn in their markets is not as deep as in some of the other markets that have already been hit. And we shall see how all of that evolves. Then we have others that are still resilient that are still growing, countries in Latin America, Indonesia, Turkey, and I have mentioned earlier, we have got a lot of small countries that make up a fairly large portion of our volume. Over 100 countries that we have, with per caps of less than 150, where last year we have grown almost double digits, 8% to 9% in these countries.  So all the investments that we\u2019re doing on the ground, in distribution, in customer connectivity, in cold drink equipment, in packaging, in new product, are paying off in a lot of those markets.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Carlos Laboy - Credit Suisse.\nCarlos Laboy - Credit Suisse: On Japan, the co-op of the bottlers there was being restructured and you were looking at the structure of Japan, I was hoping you could offer some thoughts on how you see that system evolving and whether you see yourself having to buy any bottlers there. And on the issue of China, how detached do you feel that your business trends might be from these macro pressures given how low you are in the evolutionary development of these markets for you?\nMuhtar Kent: Let me just talk first, shed some light on the supply chain. The supply chain was set up for speed, flexibility, as well as scale, in Japan and none of that is being lost as we restructure it. The key is now it is much more aligned with local bottlers and how they ensure that their needs are met on a more timely basis. So it\u2019s a restructuring but ensuring that the scale and the flexibility and the speed is still there. That is point number one on Japan. In terms of detachment, in markets like India and China that you referenced, our per capitas area still very, very low. 24 in China, less than 24 in India and again, we know that there is a pressure on migrant workers, for example. I will give you one example in China, that are returning back to the rural areas. Well, we have 30+ bottling plants in China, scattered across the whole country. We are selling to those rural customers and we were selling to them before they migrated to the cities and we are selling to them now. And we are, again, re-architecturing, creating new price points, ensuring that we are available and we are available in more formats with different price points to ensure that the affordability of our brands is still in place for Chinese and Indian consumers as well as consumers across all of the emerging markets can still afford and buy our products.  Trademark Coke in China was up 18% in Q4, Minute Main Pulpy, a great product, that was up almost more than 50% in Q4 and is now a couple of hundred million case business on its own in China. And we\u2019ve doubled our volume in tea last year in China. Growth more than 90%. So again, a lot of our organic growth has been very successful in China. And I repeat, organic growth. \nCarlos Laboy - Credit Suisse: Just to clarify on the Japan issue, do you see yourselves having to inject yourselves into Japan maybe more aggressively in terms of M&A? There was a transaction that hit the tape on Japanese bottling.\nMuhtar Kent: I think the thing about Japan is, think about it, we have had success with our cluster in west Japan. It has produced good results, achieving great market results now, with that cluster that has been formed where we injected ourselves in a minority position but ensured that we played a critical role in creating West Japan.  And again, after the investment that we had in Coca-Cola Bottlers Tokyo, we are continuing to work to create the next cluster in Japan, around [Kynto] and if there is a need for us to inject ourselves in a small way, to ensure that we can play a role of catalyst there, we will do so.\nOperator: Your final question comes from Celso Sanchez \u2013 Citigroup\nCelso Sanchez \u2013 Citigroup: Could you talk a little bit about the fountain business in North America, specifically the U.S.? The innovations with the mega-choice dispenser that you will be displaying next week certainly encouraging. But if you could speak more to the organizational changes that may be occurring in terms of how you approach the business and how you approach it in conjunction with your bottlers? I would love to see your roles evolving, both bottler and brand owner, over the next 12 months or so.\nMuhtar Kent: First, the fountain of the future is something we\u2019re very excited about. We have been working on this as part of our innovation pipeline over the past couple of years and certainly what we have seen so far is very encouraging in that the consumer gets excited with the choice and with the flavors and certainly compared to a much more limited choice, we see great consumer excitement in the marketplace and how the consumer interacts. So we\u2019re excited with what that will bring to us in a key channel of our business in North America and other parts of the world as we roll it out. So our efforts are really focused on the deployment of beverage offerings that this will create a lot of excitement at the point of sale with all of our customers as we start to roll that out. And I hope that you can see it for yourself at Cagney next week. In terms of the organizational change, an approach to business with our bottler and price pack architecture, don\u2019t think about it as an organizational change. Think about it as a tremendously aligned approach. We have dual customer calling in about 20% of CC\u2019s territory. We have begun to move to a single call model in the market to improve value to the customer and the system and it\u2019s in early stages of its development and it\u2019s all about being more effective in the marketplace and it\u2019s all about being flexible and fast in the marketplace.\nCelso Sanchez \u2013 Citigroup: That sounds like a procedural change but I was wondering more along the lines of the alignment you spoke of in the markets where there is not dual calling. Is there room for improvement, do you think, for the alignment of price pack between found and bottle can?\nMuhtar Kent: I think there is and that\u2019s one of the work streams that we have with CCE and our other bottling partners, what we call fountain harmony, which offers the opportunity to implement the occasions brands package pricing as well as channel architecture across on-premise channels in a manner that will ensure that we meet evolving consumer desires. And also the incremental volume opportunities.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you. Our focus in this challenging and dynamic environment is to proactively drive our strategic agenda. We see tremendous opportunity to extend the reach potential and profitability of our business around the world despite the prevailing macro conditions and we are confident we have the right strategies as well as the right leadership team to do just that. We also remain committed to always ensuring open and ongoing transparent communication with you, our investors.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call."}, {"symbol": "KO", "quarter": 3, "year": 2008, "date": "2008-10-15 14:52:19", "content": "Executives:  Ann Taylor - Vice President and Director of Investor Relations Muhtar Kent - President and Chief Executive Officer Gary P.

Morgan Marc Greenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities Carlos Laboy - Credit Suisse\nOperator:  Welcome everyone to The Coca-Cola Company third quarter 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce Ann Taylor, Vice President and Director of Investor Relations. \nAnn Taylor:  I'm joined by Muhtar Kent, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Gary Fayard, our Chief Financial Officer, and Sandy Douglas, our North America Group President. Following prepared remarks this morning by Muhtar and Gary we will turn the call over for your questions. Before we get started I'd like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent SEC report.  In addition, I would also like to note that we have posted schedules on our company website at www.TheCoca-ColaCompany.com under the Financial Information tab in the Investor section which reconciles certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to by our senior executives in our discussion this morning and from time to time in discussing our financial performance as reported under generally accepted accounting principals. Please look on our website for this information. Now let me turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent:  I'm happy to report that our financial performance continues to be strong and I'm pleased with our results for the quarter. Our ability to proactively address the rapidly changing economic environment exemplifies the strength of the Coca-Cola system. The fundamentals of our business are strong and we continue to work closely with our bottling partners to take action to drive sustainability growth.  We are clearly in uncharted territory in these global markets, and we continue to calibrate and recalibrate the actions we need to take to continue delivering strong results. Given our performance this quarter and our proven ability to deliver strong and sustainable long-term results for our shareowners, we remain confident in our ability to navigate in these challenging times.  However, the current global macroeconomic environment continues to be volatile. This is particularly true in North America, and we expect this to continue through 2009 with economic growth moderating around the globe. Nevertheless, I remain confident that we operate in a very resilient industry and that we have the management and strategies to help us operate successfully during these difficult times. Our performance during the third quarter demonstrates this resilience.  During the third quarter we achieved double-digit comparable earnings per share growth of 17%, marking our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, which means we are well ahead of our long-term earnings growth model in 2008.  Our unit case volume increased 5% in the quarter and, as expected, accelerated versus the second quarter, which was impacted by several one-time events. Revenue growth increased 9%. This growth was negatively impacted by 2 percentage points due primarily to the sale of bottlers. So, excluding the sale of bottlers, revenue increased by a very solid 11%.  Once again, we successfully balanced the value and volume equation to deliver consistent top line performance. Ongoing operating income increased 17%, reflecting the solid revenue growth, continued brand investment and disciplined management of operating expenses.  Year-to-date, cash generation remains strong, with over $5.5 billion from operations. By any measure, a strong set of results. Our volume performance during the quarter was again led by our international markets, including solid growth across most emerging markets. Unit case volume in international markets increased 7%, cycling 8% growth in the prior year quarter. The international performance was driven by 5% growth in sparkling beverages, including Coca-Cola, up by 4%, Coca-Cola Zero up by 22%, and strong growth in both Sprite as well as Fanta. Coca-Cola Zero, now in over 100 markets worldwide, is on plan to exceed half a billion unit cases for 2008.  Most key emerging markets delivered solid growth, with China up 17%, India up 18%, and Brazil and Mexico both up 7%. In addition, we saw strong performances in Argentina, Turkey, Eastern Europe, Southern Eurasia, Pakistan, North and West Africa, Nigeria, Korea, and across most of Southeast Asia, including Thailand. As you can see, our quality performance spans most of the globe. In countries with per capitas of less than 150, our volume growth was 9% in the quarter, cycling 12% from prior year.  Importantly, we continued to gain volume and value share in most of our key markets and in core sparkling and still beverages. This illustrates how the strength of our brands and the strength of our system enable us to successfully operate in tough environments. History has proven by continuing to invest in our business, even during difficult economic times, we can further strengthen our bonds with consumers, thus garnering a stronger share position for the long term. Simply said, we are winning in the marketplace. Let me turn now to the results in our geographies.  Latin America once again achieved very solid results. Unit case volume increased 8%, cycling 9% growth in prior year. The growth was balanced across geographies as well as the beverage portfolio, with all business units delivering high single-digit unit case volume growth. Coca-Cola increased 4% and still beverages increased 38% in the quarter as we continued to leverage the Jugos del Valle acquisition. The group also continued to achieve share gains in all key countries. In Eurasia and Africa we achieved unit case volume growth of 9%, cycling 13% growth in the prior year. The performance was led by double-digit growth in key markets, including India, Nigeria, Turkey, Southern Eurasia, and high single-digit growth in the Middle East and Northwest Africa. Growth was solid across sparking and still beverages, with sparkling beverages growing 6% and still beverages growing 21%.  In Russia unit case volume declined 3%, primarily reflecting the impact from unseasonable weather and economic and inflationary pressures. Despite the slowdown of volume growth in Russia, we gained volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready to drink beverages in the quarter and the fundamentals of our business in this key market remain strong. The Pacific group grew unit case volume 7% in the quarter, cycling 11% growth in the prior year. China and Japan delivered strong results, solid results offsetting weaknesses in the Philippines due to continuing weather and inflationary pressures, both of which impacted consumer spending.  China once again delivered solid double-digit growth, which accelerated versus the second quarter. Sparkling beverages grew 13% and still increased 27%, led by the continued success of Minute Maid Pulpy and the expansion of our Original Leaf Tea, which, as you will recall, we launched earlier this year.  Perhaps the most significant achievement for the company in the quarter was our successful activation of the Beijing Olympic games sponsorship. Our sponsorship attracted widespread positive media and consumer attention for the company in China and around the world.  During the 16 days of the games, over half a billion Chinese consumers connected with our brands through sampling programs, Olympic torch relay activities, and downloads of the Coca-Cola Olympics song, which was downloaded over 260 million times and reached number one on the pop music charts in the country. All of these activities, as well as numerous other events and promotions, resulted in Coca-Cola being cited as the most recognized and effective sponsor of the Beijing games, as reported by Neilson.  Also in the quarter we announced our offer to acquire China Huiyuan Juice Group Ltd. The acquisition provides a unique opportunity to complement our existing leadership in China in sparkling beverages and expand our presence in still beverages, particularly in the dynamic and fast-growing juice category. Huiyuan brands are highly complementary to our Minute Maid business and Huiyuan's existing manufacturing footprint will provide additional scale to our China operations. In terms of the process, we've filed for Chinese Ministry of Commerce approval and are fully cooperating with their review of the transaction.  In Japan volume increased 1%, successfully cycling 4% growth in the prior year, resulting in nonalcoholic ready to drink retail share gain. We continued to invest in our three cola strategy, and the success of this was evident in the growth of sparkling beverages during the quarter, which was led by trademark Coca-Cola.  Additionally, we've continued with successful innovation behind the Fanta trademark. Georgia Coffee grew 4%, marking its fourth consecutive quarter of growth and core Georgia flavors increased 10%. The strength of the marketing activity behind the Georgia brand led the continued category share gain.  In Japan, we've continued to execute against our strategies and focus on delivering consistent sustainable results.  The Europe group overcame a slowing Western European economy and unseasonable weather in Northwest Europe to increase volume 3%. Despite the challenges, we are outperforming the marketplace and gaining overall nonalcoholic beverage share. We continue to strike a balance between tactically addressing the current economic environment and investing for long-term growth by supporting our core sparkling brands and driving innovation across the portfolio. Driving sparkling performance in Europe is the development of the Zero range, including Coca-Cola Zero, which grew double digits in the quarter, the launch of the Pan-European Pemberton program, which highlights the heritage of Coca-Cola, and the German launch of the Spirit of Georgia, our first adult-targeted lightly sparkling lemonade beverage containing fermented juices.  We continue to expand our still beverage offerings to generate more balanced growth, including continued support of Illy ready to drink coffee, which is now in 9 markets, as well as Vitamin Water in Great Britain. We are consistently making solid strategic investments behind our brands for the balance of 2008 in Europe, and we will activate the recently announced Zero Zero 7 campaign supporting the latest James Bond film as well as our traditional holiday campaign.  In North America results were clearly impacted by the volatile economic environment, however it is important to recognize volume declines of 2% outperformed the industry in the quarter. This resulted in total measured and unmeasured nonalcoholic ready to drink volume and value share gains in the quarter.  Sparkling beverages declined 2% in the quarter, an improvement from the year-to-date trend, and resulted in core sparkling volume and value share gains. This reflects the successful activation and execution of our Olympic marketing program during July and August. Our red, black and silver portfolio - Coca-Cola Classic, Coca-Cola Zero and Diet Coca-Cola - continued to gain volume and value share as well.  Coca-Cola Zero delivered strong results, growing 30% in the quarter, cycling double-digit growth from the prior year. However, there was continued softness in our Food Service business and other on-premise channels, both of which are being impacted by the current economic reality. Additionally, bottler pricing post-Labor Day has impacted volume performance. As a consequence, we are aggressively moving to address these challenges by allocating resources to consumer and customer-facing programs. Our still beverages portfolio continued to outperform the industry, resulting in volume and value share gains. Our multi-tiered juice strategy, led by double-digit growth in Minute Maid Enhanced and Simply trademarks resulted in continued superior category performance and share gain.  Glaceau performance remains solid, increasing double digits in the quarter, with strong performance in the immediate consumption and non-measured channels, driving increased volume and value share leadership. Glaceau remains on target to becoming a $2 billion trademark in early 2009. Glaceau, along with trademark Simply, Coca-Cola Zero, [Nos] and Fuse are five of the top 10 fastest growing trademarks in incremental retail sales for North America.  Last week we also announced a distribution agreement for Hansen's Monster Energy Drinks. We believe the Monster brand will complement our existing portfolio of energy drinks and provide our bottlers with further opportunity to drive profitable growth. While we have a strong marketing calendar with our bottling system and customers across sparkling and still brands for the remainder of the year, we expect fourth quarter volume to trail the year-to-date trend due to the continued impacts of the economic slowdown and bottler pricing action. We continue to focus on productivity and expense management initiatives to target investments in consumer and customer-facing programs for future growth in North America. We remain committed to our strategies and to winning in North America.  Now let me update you on our company wide productivity initiative, which has been up and running since last quarter. We are leveraging our efforts to redirect investments to drive top line growth and long-term sustainable value creation. Our systemwide focus on productivity remains a priority for 2008 and beyond.  As you know from our last call, we moved early to take aggressive steps in this area. Through this work we are rewiring our business and reallocating our resources to be more directly focused on the marketplace as well against our highest growth opportunities. Building strong brands with world class marketing is the key to our sustainable top line growth.  As previously indicated, our target is to generate annualized operating savings in the range of $400 to $500 million by the end of 2011. These are savings accruing directly to the The Coca-Cola Company. We will also continue to work towards improving the system supply chain. We also previously indicated that there will be nonrecurring costs of approximately $400 to $500 million associated with implementing these initiatives and that both the benefits and the costs would be spread fairly equally annually through 2011. A team led by seasoned operators has ensured that we are on track to deliver against these targets, and we have already begun to benefit meaningfully from this initiative in 2008.  Once again, I am pleased with our results for the quarter. We are winning in the market as evidenced by our share gains in key categories and markets. Our increased focus on effectiveness and efficiency is providing the additional flexibility needed to consistently deliver long-term growth and create value for our share owners.  During periods of economic stress, the merits of The Coca-Cola Company truly come to the fore, as we have seen again in this most recent quarter. Our brands and our business were built for times like these. We have a seasoned management team with great experience honed through many tough cycles in markets across the globe. Our business is balanced across nearly every market, our product portfolio spans most major nonalcoholic beverage categories, and our brands are available in more channels and outlets than any other consumer company.  This quarter's performance reflects that reality. Backed by a solid balance sheet, The Coca-Cola Company continues to deliver attractive earnings growth, strong free cash flow, as well as a reliable dividend that we have included for 46 straight years in both good and challenging times. It is incumbent upon us to ensure that we not only meet these challenges but that we use them to our advantage. We continue to define our picture of success as exceeding our long-term growth model. We are also realistic about the operating environment for 2009. We're in the process of reviewing and finalizing our plans for 2009 and will provide more color on our expectations for next year during our fourth quarter call in February. However, you can expect us to continue to invest to fuel brand growth while aggressively managing costs. I remain confident we're building a stronger Coca-Cola system for the future.  With that, let me turn the call over to Gary.\nGary P. Fayard:  As Muhtar indicated, we've just again delivered strong financial results in the quarter. We reported earnings per share of $0.81 per share on a diluted basis in the quarter; however, this included a net charge of $0.02 per share for restructuring charges and costs related to global productivity initiatives, partially offset by the gain on the sale of a portion of our investment in our Pakistan bottler. Therefore, comparable earnings per share was $0.83 per share, an increase of 17% after considering factors impacting comparability in both the current and prior year quarters, our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable EPS growth.  Net revenue in the quarter increased 9% and increased 11% excluding the impact from structural changes primarily related to the sale of bottlers. Growth was driven by 2% favorable impact from price and mix, a 3% increase in concentrate sales, and a 6% increase from currency. In the quarter, unit case volume increased 5%, cycling 6% growth in the prior year quarter, and year-to-date concentrate sales and unit case growth rates are essentially in line.  We grew operating income by 20% on a reported basis. After considering items impacting comparability and the current and prior year quarters, operating income increased 17%, which includes a 9% benefit from currencies. Year-to-date, our currency neutral operating income of 9% remains ahead of our 6% to 8% long-term target. Total selling, general and administrative expenses on an ongoing basis increased 8% in the quarter. This translated into 5 points of operating expense leverage. We continued to invest in our brands and build market execution capabilities. Marketing expenses increased at approximately the same rate as gross profit growth, and sales and service increased solidly to support our bottling operations.  Our focus on expense management and productivity initiatives is reflected in a mid single-digit decrease in general and administrative expenses. Additionally, we continue to see year-to-date margin improvement in both our core business and in our Bottling Investments group. For the remainder of the year we would expect to continue to achieve expense leverage, but at a more moderate rate as we start to cycle some of the programs put in place late last year.  Our net interest expense decreased in the quarter, reflecting the benefit of interest income earned internationally at higher rates.  And with regard to taxes, we ended up the quarter with an underlying effective tax rate of 22%, and we expect to remain at the underlying effective rate for the remainder of the year.  As we've previously announced during the quarter, we have curtailed our share repurchase program for the remainder of the year as we pursue the acquisition of the Huiyuan juice business in China. We repurchased a slight number of additional shares at the beginning of the quarter and now have bought approximately $1.1 billion of our stock year-to-date.  Now let me address some of the factors that we see impacting the remainder of 2008. We remain confident in our ability to achieve long-term sustainable growth and our picture of success remains to exceed our long-term growth model. We will continue to portfolio manage globally as we expect solid performance in most of our markets. While we expect economic growth in some emerging markets to moderate, we believe that key emerging markets like China, India, Eurasia and Latin America should continue, with solid business growth.  It is our belief that among other consumer goods companies, our business will better navigate the current economic environment as we reach the consumer through a broader array of channels and packages with preferred brands. Improvement in our market share will continue to be a benchmark of our success.  Globally, we are working closely with our bottling partners. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, and as a system we continue to take appropriate actions to navigate the near-term volatility while strategically investing behind our brands in the marketplace for long-term growth. Last quarter we revised our net capital expenditure forecast to approximately $1.8 to $1.9 billion, and we'll likely come out close to $1.9 billion for the full year.  Lastly, as you saw in the quarter, structural changes primarily related to disposal of bottlers, caused a drag on net revenue growth. We sold all of the Remil bottler in Brazil to Coca-Cola FEMSA at the end of the second quarter. We sold a portion of our investment in the Pakistan bottler to our Turkish bottler at the end of the third quarter such that we now own just under 50% and will no longer consolidate the Pakistan bottler, but include it in equity income.  Additionally, we will not have the offsetting impacts of the Norsa bottler in Brazil and PCAG, our German bottler acquisitions, as we cycle these in the third quarter, so we would expect a larger impact from structural change on net revenues in the fourth quarter and into 2009.  Moving now to two key topics - liquidity and currency. Given the recent market volatility, I know liquidity may be top of mind for some of you. Our liquidity remains strong and our commercial paper program continues to function each day as broadly authorized by investors and is [praised] strongly. We have been able to continue to access 60 to 90-day terms and have not had a material change to our spreads to benchmark rates.  We also have $2.2 billion of committed unused credit facilities from our network of relationship banks and our almost $8 billion in cash is available and in liquid, high-quality investments. Most of the cash is offshore, but we have reviewed our contingency plans and would be able to access the cash on short notice.  Year-to-date we have generated over $5.5 billion in cash from operations and, in short, liquidity is not a concern as we're able to fund our operations from internal cash generation and commercial paper.  With regard to currency, as I mentioned, we saw a positive impact from currencies in the quarter on operating income of 9% and 10% year-to-date. We are maintaining our full year 2008 forecast of at least a mid single-digit currency benefit. We realized a stronger than expected benefit in the third quarter which we expect to be offset by a slightly weaker forecast in the fourth quarter, therefore no change for the full year. As for our 2009 currency outlook, it is obviously a very volatile environment. We're already 100% covered on key hard currencies like the Euro and the yen. Emerging market currencies are particularly volatile, as we've seen over the last few weeks; therefore, it would be impractical to give a view on currencies for 2009 at this time. However, it is important to note that we manage our business in local currency to ensure that we make the right decisions for the long term. As Muhtar indicated, we're in the process of finalizing our 2009 business plans, so we'll provide our outlook for 2009 on our year end call in February. So that's the topics I wanted to cover this morning. We're ready for questions.\nOperator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Bill Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley.\nBill Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley:  You mentioned the system's ability to adapt to the rapidly changing economic environment as a key competitive advantage. Can you give us some examples, some of the tactics the system is using to adapt, especially as immediate consumption begins to slow in several regions of the world, maybe a shift in channel or package focus to adapt to that? \nMuhtar Kent: First I think what you need to see is that we keep focus with our strategies of growing sparkling and expanding still beverages, balanced growth, increasing our pace of innovation and growing capability. But within that, as I said, we've continued to calibrate and recalibrate to ensure that our system remains very flexible, leveraging new packaging innovations, new price points, and also ensuring that there's an absolute good balance between above the line and below the line activities; a much closer relationship with our customers, value offers.  And in this environment more and more people, particularly in the West, are going to spend more time at home and we have programs to address that with future consumption, bringing back refillables in many countries in emerging markets. So all of that taken as a whole, I think - affordability focus, new price points, package innovation, and continued bottler investment ensure that we keep focus.  There is no other business in the world that visits 20 million customers on a weekly basis and no other business that is as close to the marketplace as our business, so we've continued to leverage that and stay connected with all local markets and I think we're seeing the benefit of that. \nBill Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley: Any implications for system margins as you see more of the future consumption focus or are you going to pull various levers so the system can maintain margins as you get that shift?\nMuhtar Kent: I think we will balance the margins with share gains. And we want to be absolutely sure that we do the right thing for the long term. You know, I've been through this movie in smaller versions a number of times in the past - in 1998 in Russia, 2001 in Turkey, and in Latin America - and I can tell you that the key here is to make sure that you keep connected to the consumer, maintain the health of your brands, and that's what you're going to be seeing us do.  But also we are going to be making sure that any kind of costs that are not necessary are going to be - we will continue to eliminate them out of our system religiously and refocus our resources to market-facing and customer-facing activity. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.:  Muhtar, can you speak to the resiliency of or even sequential improvement of some of your key international markets in terms of volume trends in Q3 versus Q2? And then, as you look out to 2009, as you kind of deal with the economic conditions - and I understand you're not giving specific guidance - but if you can give us some perspective as to how you think about '09 relative to your long-term growth targets, both from a volume and EPS perspective.\nMuhtar Kent: I think what you see, Judy, is first, you see the balanced portfolio working in our favor. We had some countries that even again in the third quarter did not perform up to our expectations, like Philippines, like Russia, like U.S. Food Service. Germany was flat. But despite that we came in with a very strong quarter. You saw that every single one of our international operating groups increased their growth trend versus the second quarter of '08 - Europe from zero to 3%, Latin America from 7% to 8%, Eurasia and Africa from 6% to 9%, and the Pacific group going from 4% to 7%.  And we had indicated to you that there was a lot of one-off items in the second quarter that were impacting our business, and I think that you saw us coming through in what was still a very difficult quarter. And the balance and our actions, the flexibility in the marketplace, our bottlers' ability to continue and an appetite to continue to invest in the marketplace, you saw us coming through.  I think that there are going to be areas of the world next year that will be growing less. There will be growth for sure in the emerging markets. It may not be to the same extent as we saw this year, but I think that despite the volatility we are in the best consumer business there is. Tremendous resilience, providing we take the right actions, and you will see us taking the right actions.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: And your comment about the fourth quarter volume trending a bit below the year-to-date volume, is that more a function of North America potentially showing another leg down or is that also related to international markets?\nMuhtar Kent: No, no, that was purely - that comment was purely related to North America, and I made sure that I stated it that way. It was purely related to North America and related to those issues that I discussed with you because of the continuing pressure on immediate consumption and attitudes of the U.S. consumer as well as pricing to shore up the margins by our bottling partners at the end of the quarter.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: And then just a quick question for you, Gary. If you look at your expense leverage, clearly a big driver is the corporate expenses coming down. And if we look at the run rate in the last two quarters, it looks like around 3% of net sales. Is that sort of a good run rate to use going forward?\nGary P. Fayard:  Yes, Judy, I would expect that the run rate will be about that or slightly less. We actually started having some of that leverage coming through in the fourth quarter of last year, so it'll actually go down a little bit because of what we're cycling. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS.\nKaumil Gajrawala - UBS:  A couple questions on the regions that you mentioned with the per caps under 150. First, just quickly, how much of your volume comes from those regions? And then second, given the economic environment, should we be assuming a lower run rate, maybe these regions in aggregate going forward? And then are some of these regions big enough that we should start seeing margins grow at a much faster rate than we're seeing sales grow?\nMuhtar Kent: I think roughly it's fair to say about a third of our volume globally will come from those kind of markets, per capitas of around 150. And I think that what you've seen in many of the markets that were there and now are at higher per capitas - Latin American markets, South Africa, Turkey and so forth, that have passed that level - you're seeing margins for the system improving fairly radically. And I think that as we see per capitas growing, we certainly will make sure that the same trend is also valid for margin improvement and enhancement. And I think that we are seeing from many African markets and many other smaller Latin American markets, Asian markets, Middle Eastern markets, Eurasian markets, that, as they approach the sort of 100 to 150 per capita range the scale of our business is beginning to power ahead and that we're seeing really good growth levels and also margin enhancement in these countries.\nKaumil Gajrawala - UBS: And then on a volume run rate?\nMuhtar Kent: I think that basically I am cautiously optimistic that we will have growth coming through in all those markets, as we've seen this year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch.\nChristine Farkas - Merrill Lynch:  There were some reversals, as you indicated, in the third quarter versus the second quarter. I'm wondering if you can talk about early fourth quarter trends, specifically in Russia given their macro environment, China post the Olympics and how those trends are, and then Mexico on the back of the U.S. economy. I mean, your volumes there have been pretty strong. Can you talk about perhaps the competitive environment?\nMuhtar Kent: Firstly, I wouldn't call it reversals. I would call it improvements. But I think I can't give you basically guidance for quarter four at the moment, but I can tell you that our business is very, very strong in markets in Latin America, including but not limited to Mexico, as well as China. And I think that we certainly are going to be looking at ensuring that we can move forward with our plans for Q4 and '09 so that our picture of success remains valid, that we can meet or exceed our long-term growth targets.\nChristine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: And then a follow-up for Gary. I think if I heard you correctly you mentioned equity income may have been boosted by the impact of the sale of the Pakistan bottler. Can you tell us how much was reflected in that line item?\nGary P. Fayard: Yes, Christine. What I said was it would now be reported in equity income. We actually closed the transaction at the very end of the third quarter, so starting in the fourth quarter, but it's really not going to be a significant change. The biggest change you'll see is just it'll be a drag on top line revenue, but relative to income it's not going to make a big difference at all.\nChristine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: So the equity income line was actually just the regular equity income drawing from your anchor bottlers, etc.\nGary P. Fayard: Correct. Correct.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities.\nBryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities:  Gary, a question for you on liquidity. Just two areas of interest; one is what's the potential that there may be a tax holiday to allow you to repatriate some of that cash back to the U.S. without taking the tax penalty? And then second, just related to both bottlers and trade customers, are you seeing anything different in terms of the tighter credit markets, whether it's retailers carrying less inventory, maybe a destocking situation, or bottlers that may not have otherwise been under stress that may be stressed by the liquidity or the credit market?\nGary P. Fayard: Number one, potential for a tax holiday, you know, coming up to the election and everything else, I really don't know. If it happened we would look at it and we'd make the right decision for the long term, but that one I really can't speculate on. I don't know at this point. What I do know is we've got the cash. We can access it if needed, but whether we repatriate or not, I really can't comment on that.  Relative to bottlers and trade customers, I'd say two things. Let me address both; first, receivables, as we've really been working on our working capital. And, in fact, if you look at our cash flow, in fact, I'll point out one item within our cash flow statement that does not - it makes it look like we did not improve working capital as much as we did. There's about a $350 million tax item on a settlement of an issue with - a foreign tax issue where we paid the cash in the quarter, and we'll actually recoup it, we'll get it back, but it'll be - we'll get it back in the fourth quarter or early first quarter of next year.  So if you look, then, if you take that out, we actually bettered our use of working capital significantly, I mean, like $700 million or so year-to-date Q3 versus year-to-date Q2. The other is our days in receivables are exactly in line with where they were at the end of third quarter last year, so we've not seen any issues there. We've also not seen a lot of destocking because for us obviously it's primarily with the bottlers, and we actually work with the bottlers every year as we put our plans together on optimizing what their inventory should be. And so it's something we work on routinely every year to ensure that they're in exactly the right place because we don't want them holding too much inventory and having a lot of working capital tied up, either. So I think we're in a pretty good place right now.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Lauren Torres - HSBC.\nLauren Torres - HSBC:  [inaudible] has been rather vocal, I'd say, over the course of this year with regard to challenges in several of their markets. You've been somewhat more positive on emerging market growth, but I was hoping you could address specific markets, expectations for Russia, maybe parts of Eastern Europe. I know there's some macro challenges or there are macro challenges, but I was just curious about your thoughts looking out over the next year or so about a return to some more normalized growth there.\nMuhtar Kent: Yes, Lauren. First, the current conditions in Eastern Europe, Russia, the markets of Eurasia are still - the macroeconomic conditions are still such that they are generating growth. And the sentiment is a lot better than it is, say, in the United States or Western Europe. Now, I don't think they'll get as bad as the United States or Western Europe. I don't think they will stay as good as they were in the past 12 months. Russia is certainly experiencing issues and problems in their financial markets. But I think that if you look at our business, the fundamentals of our business are strong in all these markets. We're a business, you know, you've got to keep in mind that we're a business that generates with our bottlers as a system $15 billion plus of cash a year. We visit multiple, multiple customers, millions of customers in these markets, and in many of these markets that you've referenced, the trade is very fragmented, very, very fragmented, and that I think is a big advantage going forward for us in working closely with all these smaller customers.  My experience in this kind of environment is that Coca-Cola and our brands become a bigger part of the revenue of these smaller customers in these circumstances. We mean more to these customers as we service them. No one services them like our system services them, and I think that is a huge advantage that we will continue to leverage in this environment.\nLauren Torres - HSBC: So with that said, even though we may see some volume weakness, you're still seeing share gains, be it volume or value share gains?\nMuhtar Kent: Yes. And I do still believe that there will be growth in these markets for our business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.:  Muhtar, acquisitions. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more here about you appetite for additional multi-billion dollar acquisitions generally? And then, with share repo being on hold because of Huiyuan, if the right thing were to present itself, is there any issue with your credit rating given, you know, you backed up your bottlers, that would prevent you over the near term from doing additional major acquisitions? \nMuhtar Kent: Right. Mark, I'd just say the following: First, I said it and I'll repeat it again. Organic growth is key to our success. Sparkling growth is key to our success. It's the oxygen. We've got to balance sparkling growth with still growth, and we've got to have organic growth. And any opportunities for acquisitions will come on top of that. That remains absolutely valid. Huiyuan, I think, is a great opportunity, and we continue to work with the Chinese government. We are the first company to apply to the Minister of Commerce under the new law, and we believe that we will prevail in China with that great opportunity.  If there are any other opportunities that present themselves, our strategy remains bolt-on acquisitions are still part of the strategy. And we will make sure that, if we see a great opportunity for the future of our business, complementing our existing business in a country, we will not let it go by.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Faucher - J.P. Morgan.\nJohn Faucher - J.P. Morgan:  In looking at the performance of your publicly traded anchor bottlers year-to-date, obviously some pretty tough times in that regard, so I guess a couple of questions. You've talked about selling off bottling assets. We've begun to see that a little bit. Has the change in the public market valuations drifted into the private markets? And then, flipping that around, given the fact that the private market valuations are so low, does that change your interest in maybe bringing more bottlers into the hospital ward or is that something you say, look, we're going to worry about the market. We'll let the market deal with that, and we're just focused on operating where we need to operate.\nMuhtar Kent: I'll reflect on that and maybe Gary can also comment on it. Firstly, I was with - we had a big bottlers meeting three weeks ago with about 50 of our top bottlers around the world, the first meeting of its kind for some time, and I can only tell you that I think everyone comes away with tremendous passion, realistic optimism as well as determination to continue driving our business, to continue investing, and to continue to do the right things for our business whether they're public or private bottlers.  And I think that nothing really has changed from our strategy in terms of looking at homes for bottlers that - weaker currently - are running when it makes sense, the right homes, and also if there's a need, we will not hesitate to bring another bottler into our sphere. However, I don't see anything near on the horizon for us to do that right now, and I think that I came away, as well as our bottling partners came away, from that meeting really charged up and really feeling good about the future of our business.\nGary P. Fayard: And John, I would add relative to values of the bottlers that we have, that we own, I'd say a couple of things. Number one, we've always taken a long-term view basically that we would only sell a bottler if the purchaser had the financial and the management resources to really grow that market for the long term, and that when selling we would sell at a fair value. And so I would say that's still where we are. If we were looking to sell a bottler today, we would be looking for fair value and then that would be just subject to negotiation on how you define that number. But our strategy really has not changed at all.\nJohn Faucher - J.P. Morgan: And then if I could ask one follow up on that, which would be you guys have been managing Philly Coke for awhile now. Any insight into how the rest of your North American bottling system should deal with its recent struggles given the fact that you guys have a little bit more hands on experience right now?\nMuhtar Kent: Well, I think, John, we're learning from many experiments in North America. It's not just Philly. I think Philly is doing many things to prop up their on-premise business very successfully. In fact, they've been proving to everyone that sparkling beverages can grow again in North America if you do the right things. But then with many of our other bottlers, including [CC], we have a number of initiatives going, whether it be packaging initiatives, whether it be sparkling growth initiatives, whether it be still growth initiative, on-premise initiatives as well as in the Food Service business of ours, where we're looking at commercializing a number of innovations in the coming months. So I think it's not just limited to Philly, and the entire system - the entire system - is really learning from all the - not experiments but lead market tests that we're doing, not just experiments. And I think that you will see us rolling out a number of those very, very shortly.  And Sandy Douglas is here, President of our North American business, and I'll ask him to also shed some light on that.\nSandy Douglas:  Muhtar, I think you said it well. We've been working with the entire system on remerchandising the sparkling packaging mix with a number of lead markets, all bottlers involved. We're working closely with the system to create new processes and approaches for managing large customers, and we're continuing to work on integrating our supply chain to drive out waste and to be able to have more money to invest in the consumer and the customer.  And we couldn't be happier about bottler involvement and participation, and those lead markets, as you say, are presenting a road map for us to go forward that will put us in a stronger position in the years ahead.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Marc Greenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities.\nMarc Greenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities:  First, just a follow up on John's question. In light of Pepsi's comments yesterday about taking a restructuring and investing significant new monies behind North America, Sandy or Muhtar, do you feel that the absolute level of investment behind the U.S. business is sufficient right now? Is it going to be a step change kind of a year in 2009?\nMuhtar Kent: Yes, Marc, I think you need to understand that we have been on a path indicating and saying and wholly believing that sparkling beverages can grow in North America since late 2004. And we have pushed this agenda forward, and you've seen the successes of Coca-Cola Zero and many other initiatives. Fanta brand also doing really well in our business in North America. Don't forget that we also took out $400 million in '05 and invested it in marketing across the world, and a lot of that was honed in here in the United States. So our marketing base had already grown.  We will continue with our bottling partners to ensure that we have the right level of investments in North America, to make sure that we can leverage all of the opportunities that we talked about in the answer to the previous question, to make sure that we can replicate great experiments, great examples, great lead market stories in both innovations in packaging, new price points, and much more inspiration at the point of sale, much more focus on gaining availability in the universe of accounts that we have. And learn from all the lead markets in the United States and make sure that we have the right level of investment, customer-facing and consumer-facing investments.\nMarc Greenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities: Gary, just a quick housekeeping item. The 7% volume growth in Mexico, I'm wondering if there's any kind of a timing or acquisition bump in there. Based on comments and guidance from some of the larger Mexican bottlers, our sense was that it wasn't going to be that big a number in the quarter, and obviously expectations for the fourth quarter may be coming down a little bit. Can you talk to that?\nGary P. Fayard: Yes, Marc. In Mexico specifically, acquisitions contributed low single digits to that growth rate or 5 points to that growth rate and our organic was low single digits. \nOperator: Your last question comes from Carlos Laboy - Credit Suisse.\nCarlos Laboy - Credit Suisse:  Muhtar, you've mentioned this, I think, in some form, but market downturns sometimes - they open up opportunities to radically change a market. Argentina a few years ago, for example, comes to mind. Can you expand on the company owned bottler performance expectation through this macro slowdown and whether it's Germany or the Philippines, what kind of opportunities do you see in this downturn to gain competitive ground?\nMuhtar Kent: Well, Carlos, I see opportunities in their environment not just for our company owned bottling operations, for our entire bottling system. I want to stress that. And I think that the consolidation in Germany is complete. We are gaining share in the German market. We are doing some great things under one of our great operators in our bottling business in Germany, and we're gaining great traction with discounters in Germany. And I see the business fundamentals getting stronger every day. In the Philippines, I think we're again doing exactly the right things for the long term. We had a disappointing quarter in the Philippines - it was 9% down - but you will see that trend improving going forward. And I think that the Philippines has had more than its fair share of this economic volatility in the third quarter, with food pricing really affecting consumer spending and sentiment. But going forward I believe that trends in the Philippines are going to improve.  And I think in China, again, we're doing exactly the right things to have a great, great business. I always say China is another Coca-Cola company, and I firmly believe that.\nOperator: I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Kent for closing remarks.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Gary and Ann. Before we close the call I'd like to thank Ann Taylor for serving as Director of Investor Relations for the last four years. She and her team have done a tremendous job helping craft and deliver our strategic and financial message as the company has evolved during both Neville's and now my tenure as CEO. Ann will be moving within our organization to a role overseeing the company's transformation efforts, one of our most critical growth enablers. I want to thank Ann for her contributions, and I know she will continue to play a very meaningful role going forward.  I'm pleased to announce that [Jackson Kelly] has been appointed our new Director of Investor Relations. Jackson has spent the last two years working directly with me on global strategic initiatives, and Jackson's 17 years with the company, his background as a CPA as well as his experience in marketing, strategy and finance, will add an important new dimension to how we interact with each of you. Thanks for joining us this morning, and have a great day."}, {"symbol": "KO", "quarter": 2, "year": 2008, "date": "2008-07-17 12:28:13", "content": "Executives: Ann Taylor - Vice President and Director of Investor Relations Neville Isdell - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent - President, Chief Operating Officer Gary P.

My name is Dennis and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s second quarter 2008 earnings results conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would like to now introduce Ann Taylor, Vice President and Director of Investor Relations. \nAnn Taylor: Good morning and thank you for being with us today. I am joined by Neville Isdell, our Chairman; Muhtar Kent, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Gary Fayard, our Chief Financial Officer; and Sandy Douglas, our North America Group President. Following prepared remarks this morning by Neville, Muhtar, and Gary, we will turn the call over for your questions.  Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company\u2019s most recent SEC report.  In addition, I would also like to note that we have posted schedules on our company website at www.thecocacolacompany.com under the financial information tab in the investors section, which reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to by our senior executives in our discussion this morning and from time to time in discussing our financial performance to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. Please look on our website for this information.  Now let me turn the call over to Neville. \nNeville Isdell: Thank you, Ann and good morning, everyone. As you all know, this has been my final quarter as CEO of this outstanding company and before I turn the call over to Muhtar, who will provide context around the results of the second quarter and the outlook going forward, and to Gary who will give you an overview of the financials and some additional perspective on 2008, I want to make a few opening comments.  The Coca-Cola Company has made significant progress since our turnaround began in 2004. We have revitalized the sparkling beverage category globally and continue to grow trademark Coca-Cola. We\u2019ve addressed key issue markets and taken decisive actions. We have reconnected with our customers and consumers through effective marketing and innovation strategies, and we have reengaged our associates, who are absolutely key to our winning in the marketplace.  And importantly, we have successfully implemented a seamless CEO transition plan for the next leg of our journey. Clearly our strategies are working as we continue to expand our volume and value share leadership position in the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry, as well as in sparkling and key still beverage categories.  And our financial performance continues to be strong, as we deliver our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable earnings per share growth.  As I depart as CEO, I am pleased with our accomplishments and solid performance. We have put in place a strong foundation and I remain confident in our outlook for 2008 as we continue to invest and build share. Our balanced geographic mix and broad portfolio, along with the talent and experience of our people across the system, positions us well to continue to be successful, delivering growth and value for our shareowners for the long-term.  And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our new CEO, my good friend, Muhtar. Muhtar Kent, please. \nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Neville and good morning, everyone. First, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank Neville for his extraordinary leadership and the support that he has provided to me for the past two decades. I am truly honored by the confidence both he and our board of directors have shown in my ability to lead this great company.  Before I get into the specifics of our operating performance, I\u2019d like to reiterate that our business is a true great business to be in. The non-alcoholic beverage industry is the fastest growing segment of the consumer products industry and we have leading positions in almost all categories we compete in. The Coca-Cola Company offers an affordable luxury, connecting with our consumers 1.5 billion times every day.  But I know what is top of mind for all of you; the current macroeconomic environment and its impact on our results. Based on our volume performance of 3% in the quarter, it is clear we were faced with some challenges around the globe. Our results in the quarter were impacted primarily by a number of one-time events, including strikes in Europe and natural disasters in Asia, as well as unfavorable weather in a number of our markets.  Moreover, we are certainly operating in a more challenging environment, particularly as rising food and energy costs way on consumer confidence. Internationally, GDP forecasts are coming down; however, growth is still expected to remain at healthy levels, and it is no surprise that we continue to face challenges also in North America due to the U.S. economy.  We continue to invest aggressively in our portfolio with new products, marketing platforms, and a consistent strategy in very close coordination with our bottling partners to offer our customers the best beverage choices for consumers.  Our second quarter performance demonstrates our ability to leverage the strengths of our system to achieve balanced growth. Our results were once again led by our international operations, which delivered 5% unit case volume growth, cycling 9% growth in the prior year, despite some one-off events and a more challenging macroeconomic environment.  For the past few years, we have been rebuilding our foundation and solidifying our position as the leading global non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage company. We believe that our broad and balanced geographic mix positions us very well to navigate through any headwind as we continue to focus on operating efficiencies and execution strategies.  Our actions are allowing us to win in the market. Globally, we accelerated our volume and value share gains in total non-alcoholic beverages. Importantly, we gained share in most of our key markets as well as key categories, and this illustrates the strength of our brand and the strength of our system to operate successfully in tough environments. By continuing to invest in difficult economic times, our system is seeking to build a stronger bond with consumers and a stronger share position for the long-term. We clearly recognize that there are short-term challenges in the marketplace related to economic trends and we will maintain our disciplined approach of analyzing and understanding the impact of these challenges to our business and adjust our plans accordingly.  Now let me turn to our operating performance for the quarter. We increased our unit case volume by 3% in the quarter and 4% year-to-date, successfully cycling 6% growth in the prior year quarter and year-to-date period. While the growth was not where we would have liked it to be, it is not unexpected given the headwinds we faced from natural disasters, including earthquakes and floods, as well as unseasonably cold weather -- cold and wet weather in certain markets.  Additionally, we were challenged, as I said, with strikes in key European markets and continued softness in consumer trends in North America. In the quarter, our financial results remained strong. We achieved double-digit comparable earnings per share growth of 19%, now our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth.  Revenue growth was solid, increasing 17% with the acquisition of bottlers contributing two points of growth. This performance illustrates that our strategies to drive top line growth are working.  Ongoing operating income increased 20% with currency contributing 11 points of growth, so our currency neutral operating income was 9% even as we have continued to make solid, strategic investments for long-term sustainable growth.  Moving now onto our geographies, Latin America continues to be a bright spot for our system, once again achieving solid results. Unit case volume increased 7% with all business units delivering growth and the group also continued to achieve share gains in key countries. Additionally, the successful integration Jugos del Valle into our system is contributing to still beverage growth and share gains.  In Mexico, unit case volume increased 10%, led by the continued strong performance of brand Coca-Cola, up 3% and the benefit of Jugos del Valle also contributing three points to growth, all leading to volume and value share gains in sparkling as well as still beverages.  Brazil increased 1% in the quarter, reflecting the slowdown in industry growth, particularly in April as consumer spending shifted to durable goods as a result of continued credit expansion. Despite challenges in the marketplace, Brazil gained volume and value share in total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, also as well as with sparkling and still beverages.  In Africa, we achieved unit case volume growth of 5%. South Africa\u2019s unit case volume was even with last year, cycling 12% growth in the prior year quarter and reflecting the continued effects of CO2 shortages. We expect to have the CO2 shortages in our business resolved during the second half of this year.  Eurasia delivered unit case volume growth of 7%, led by solid results in India, Turkey, Eastern Europe, Southern Eurasia, and the Middle East. Growth was solid across sparkling and still beverages, with sparkling beverages growing 3% and still beverages, led by the expansion of Minute Maid in India and [Molten] Juice in Russia growing 24%.  In Russia, unit case volume growth was 2%, primarily reflecting the impact from poor weather conditions, particularly in the second half of the quarter. Despite the slowdown of volume growth in Russia, our volume and value share in non-alcoholic beverages in the quarter reached an all-time high.  The Pacific group grew unit case volume 4% in the quarter, led by China, which continued to delivered double-digit growth despite being negatively impacted by significant flooding and earthquakes in certain regions of the country. We continue to drive growth by leveraging our Olympic activation programs centered around brand Coca-Cola, expanding Minute Maid Pulpy and successfully launching our new original Leaf Tea brand.  In Japan, volume declined 1% in the quarter; however, we achieved share gains in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Sparkling beverages continued to grow, led by trademark Coca-Cola as we continue to invest behind our three cola strategy and the introduction of a new Fanta product, [Fofuru], a unique innovative sparkling jelly fusion shaker. Additionally, Georgia Coffee grew 4%, the highest growth rate for Georgia in more than five years. Core Georgia flavors contributed to more than 50% of the growth, proving our strategies to innovate the brand through marketing initiatives, new packaging, and new flavors are working well. Georgia is now in its third consecutive quarter of growth and gaining category share. Adverse weather conditions resulted in volume declines for Sokenbicha and Aquarius.  Together with our bottling partners, our outlook for Japan remains positive with an expectation of low-single-digit unit case volume growth over time. In Japan, we have a clear formula for success and we\u2019ll continue executing against our strategies.  In the Philippines, results were impacted by severe typhoons in the early part of the quarter. Additionally, we saw a slowdown in overall consumer spending in all staple goods, including beverages, due to inflationary pressures. Unit case volume grew 3%, cycling 11% growth from prior years.  We continued to gain sparkling and total volume and value share during the quarter. We remain committed to investing in the marketplace, focused on affordability and availability initiatives to drive future growth.  In the European Union group, our volume declined 1%, cycling 5% growth from the prior year. Our operations were impacted by strikes in several of our key markets and the shift of the Easter holiday into the first quarter. Volume declined in April but returned to growth in May and June. Despite these challenges, we are winning in the marketplace, gaining overall volume share and value share across the group, as well as share gains in sparkling and still beverage categories.  Coca-Cola Zero remains strong with presence in 26 countries now in the group and growing double-digits in the quarter. We continue to expand our still beverage offerings to generate more balanced growth and launched Vitamin Water in Great Britain with early signs showing good progress.  We are consistently making solid strategic investments behind our brands with marketing initiatives around Euro 2008 and the Olympics, focusing on revitalizing the sparkling category with the expansion of our Zero range portfolio and broadening our footprint in still beverages.  In Europe, we have a solid foundation in place and remain committed to executing against our strategies.  In North America, results were clearly impacted by the worsening economic environment, which as we know may continue for some time. The economic environment is reflected in the non-alcoholic beverage industry declining 2% in the quarter. However, we remain confident we have the right strategies in place to deliver long-term sustainable growth, working alongside closely with our bottling partners and customers.  Our unit case volume growth was even in the quarter, despite the challenging environment. Importantly, we\u2019ve continued to gain total beverage volume and value share. Sparkling beverages declined 4% in the quarter, reflecting the continued weakness in our food service business and other on-premise channels.  However, our red, black, and silver portfolio -- Coca-Cola Classic, Coca-Cola Zero, and Diet Coke -- continued to gain volume and value share. Coca-Cola Zero delivered strong results, growing more than 40% in the quarter, cycling double-digit growth.  Our still beverages portfolio performed strongly as unit case volume increased 9% in the quarter. Warehouse juices grew double-digits, led by trademark Simply Juices, and continued to gain volume and value share. Importantly for Glaceau, performance remained solid, up strong double-digits with strong performance in immediate consumption and non-measured channels. Additionally, Fuse continues to perform very well and for the still beverage category, we continued to gain total volume and value share.  In this difficult economic environment looking forward, we have a strong marketing calendar and our bottling system and customers across sparkling and still brands, but we expect the back half of 2008 to remain challenging in North America. We are accelerating productivity initiatives to focus investment in consumer and customer-facing programs and remain committed to winning in this important market.  Now let me cover productivity; driving effectiveness and efficiency across our entire system continues to be a key lever in our ability to consistently deliver long-term sustainable results. Recognizing the challenges we are facing, in my first two weeks as CEO I have accelerated several initiatives which were already underway focusing the system on three primary areas.  First, supply chain optimization, where we are working within our own supply chain and with our bottling partners to improve operating efficiencies to drive margin-enhancing opportunities.  Second, marketing and innovation effectiveness -- we are aggressively reviewing marketing spend to reduce non-consumer facing programs through greater use of global campaigns, leveraging best practices on creative designs and execution as well as optimizing our use of agencies and other third-party providers. As an example, we recently negotiated a global marketing research agreement that will generate savings versus the numerous local agreements in place, as well as provide additional services. These are just a few of the many steps we are taking to optimize investments behind our brands and leverage global best practices. Our objective is to reinvest marketing efficiencies we realize into -- marketing efficiencies that we realize into additional brand-building activities to drive the long-term health of our business.  And third, operating effectiveness and efficiency, which will provide us with ongoing flexibility to invest in additional initiatives to drive top line growth and also to support the foundation for future performance as well as drive more streamlined decision-making.  I\u2019ve talked to you about these opportunities before. We are now ready to share with you a range of expected monetary benefits. Our target is to generate annualized operating savings in the range of $400 million to $500 million by the end of 2011. We have already begun to implement several initiatives to realize these savings, including first by aggressively managing operating expense budgets and concentrate supply chain operations to eliminate inefficiency and waste supported by lean techniques across our operations; second, by redesigning processes to drive standardization and effectiveness; and third, by identifying opportunities to leverage our size and scale, including shared service operations.  And also, last but not least, driving savings in our indirect spend areas through the implementation of a new procure-to-pay purchasing program first in North America and Europe, which is really going to cover approximately 80% of our total indirect spend globally.  So overall, while our volume growth in the quarter was weaker than we would like, I am pleased that we successfully managed the numerous one-off factors, as well as the more challenging economic environment by delivering solid financial results and winning in the market, as evidenced by our share gains globally in key categories and also across all our markets.  Our system has proven that it is taking the right actions to be successful in the market and we will continue to do that. Going forward, we will remain relentless in becoming more efficient, leaner, and more adaptive to the changing market conditions while continuing to invest behind our brands, building a strong position for the future.  Both the fundamentals of our business and the strength of our brands continue to be solid. Through our focus on superior system execution and driving productivity, I remain confident we are building a stronger Coca-Cola system for the future.  With that, let me turn the call over to Gary. \nGary P. Fayard: Thanks, Muhtar and good morning, everyone. As Neville and Muhtar have indicated, we once again delivered strong financial results. As you saw in the release, we reported earnings per share of $0.61 per share on a diluted basis in the quarter. However, this included a net charge of $0.40 per share; $0.38 of the net charge was related to our proportionate share of the non-cash impairment charge recorded by Coca-Cola Enterprises. The remaining $0.02 of the net charge was related to restructuring charges and some tax matters, partially offset by gains from the sale of assets, primarily the sale of our [Ramill] bottler in Brazil to Coca-Cola FEMSA. Therefore, our adjusted earnings per share was $1.01 per share, an increase of 19% after considering items impacting comparability in both the current and prior year quarter, as Muhtar side, our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable earnings per share growth.  Net revenue in the quarter increased 17%, which included a 2% benefit from structural changes primarily related to our acquisitions of certain bottlers. The growth was driven by a 3% increase in concentrate sales, a 9% increase from currency, and a 3% favorable impact from price and mix.  In the quarter, unit case volume increased 3%, cycling 6% growth in the prior year quarter. Additionally, unit cases and concentrate sales are in line for the quarter and year-to-date.  We grew operating income by 18% on a reported basis. After considering items impacting comparability in the current and prior year quarters, operating income increased 20%, which includes an 11% benefit from currency.  Total SG&A on an ongoing basis increased 16% in the quarter. About 14 points of the increase was due to bottler and brand acquisitions, increased sales and service expenses, as we invested for growth in our bottling operations and because of currency. The remaining two points reflected continued investment behind our brands at a rate approximating gross profit growth while tightly controlling general and administrative expenses as we focus on expense management and productivity initiatives.  We are maintaining a disciplined approach to marketing our brands, particularly in the current environment. As Muhtar mentioned earlier, we are continuing to support our brands, building a stronger share position for the future. We\u2019re achieving this through a slight step-up in our total direct marketing spend versus our original plans, while at the same time reinvesting marketing productivity savings. We\u2019re also strategically reallocating resources against geographies and initiatives to drive sustained growth.  Additionally, we continue to see margins improve in both our core business and in our bottling investment group. Our continued focus on driving efficiencies and effectiveness throughout our organization generated four points of expense leverage on our core business in the quarter.  For the remainder of the year, we would expect to continue to achieve expense leverage but at a more moderate rate as we start to cycle some of the programs put in place late last year.  Our interest expense decreased in the quarter, reflecting the impact of a $17 million gain from terminating interest rate locks put into place in anticipation of a long-term debt issuance later this year, which is now being deferred given the current market environment, as well as lower interest rates.  We repurchased approximately $1 billion of our stock year-to-date and we continue to expect to repurchase between $1.75 billion and $2 billion for the full year 2008.  Now let me address some of the factors that we see impacting us in the remainder of this year. We remain confident in our ability to achieve long-term sustainable growth, despite a more challenging short-term environment, given our balanced geographic mix and brand portfolio. We will continue to portfolio manage globally as we expect solid performance in most of our markets, with softness in North America, as our business in North America will continue to be impacted by the difficult economic environment in the near-term.  Globally, we have strong plans in place with our bottling partners and customers for the remainder of the year, which reflects the realities of each market\u2019s economic conditions. From a commodity cost perspective, given the continued rise in oil prices and the impact on PET, we would expect a slight increase for the company for this year.  From a capital expenditure standpoint, we purchased $850 million in net property, plant, and equipment year-to-date. For 2008, the full year, we expect total company net capital expenditures will be approximately $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. That\u2019s versus our prior estimate of 1.6 to 1.7. About half of the increase is due to currency movements since the time we set our budgets and the remainder is to support the growth in our bottling investments group.  With regard to taxes, we ended up the quarter with an underlying effective tax rate of 22% and we expect to remain at that underlying effective tax rate for the remainder of the year.  Moving now to currency, as I mentioned we saw a positive impact from currency in the quarter on operating income of 11%. We are effectively covered for the full year on the YEN and the Euro, and based on current market rate expectations for the remainder of the year and benefits of coverage in place, we would expect currency benefits on operating income for the full year to be at least mid-single-digits, with most of the benefit occurring in the first three quarters of this year.  And finally, let me turn to productivity; as you saw from our release and as Muhtar mentioned, we expect to achieve $400 million to $500 million of annualized operating savings from our productivity initiatives by the end of 2011. In realizing the savings, the company expects to incur total non-recurring costs by 2011 approximately equal to the annualized savings. Starting in 2008, we expect the phasing of the savings and cost to be approximately 25% per year through 2011.  That\u2019s it for the topics I wanted to cover, so Operator, now for the questions. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Good morning, everyone. Muhtar, I was just wondering, if we looked at your volume growth of 3% in the quarter, I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a way to quantify how much of that was really one-off factors, like the labor strike, et cetera, versus the more challenging macro conditions that you\u2019ve cited.  And related to that issue, if you look at markets around the world, can you compare and contrast markets where you are seeing more negative impact from challenging macroeconomic conditions versus markets where you are not? And whether going forward, you are looking for a broader slowdown in markets where you haven\u2019t really seen the weakness in some of these markets at this point. \nMuhtar Kent: Good morning, Judy. I think as I said, I talked about the one-off events; again, just to reiterate them, China certainly experienced earthquakes, flooding, also unseasonable weather -- that certainly had an impact early in the quarter. Philippines experienced typhoons, Europe experienced unseasonable weather, very unseasonable weather in April and also we experienced labor strikes in both France, Greece, and Spain, and Japan and Russia were again impacted very significantly in terms of the unseasonable weather.  Now, it is again very difficult to quantify. We do know that these had an impact on our business, no question. And then you see countries like the Philippines where the food inflation is having an impact on consumer sentiment and we are going to see that continuing. But I think overall, we know that had these one-off events not had taken place that our volume growth would have been higher in certain markets like Russia, certainly in markets like China and also for sure in Europe, where we have a very solid foundation of our business.  So I think you can isolate some of those things into the quarter and then Brazil, where the economy is very, very robust, we saw again a significant expansion of credit endurables that had an impact on our business early in the quarter but again, that was also a one-off because that, we don\u2019t see that continuing going into the balance of the year.  So those are sort of the comments that I would give you. I think we see that although at a slightly slower rate, the macro economies in the BRIC countries are going to continue to grow and the emerging markets are going to continue to grow. The difference between what you see today in the economic environment versus what you saw perhaps a decade ago in the crisis is that the current macroeconomic -- the current economies of the emerging countries are much better positioned from a fiscal discipline, monetary discipline point of view to weather some of these current challenges and again, we will all see it and live through but I want to reiterate that certainly the business that we are in is the business that -- where we sell essentially a very affordable luxury, billions of times every day, is one where we are very confident that we can continue to grow going forward. \nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay, and just a clarification on this year\u2019s outlook, because I think Gary mentioned that you guys are confident in achieving the long-term growth targets this year. Does that mean -- are you backing off on your comment before about the picture of success this year exceeding those long-term targets?\nMuhtar Kent: We have reiterated that our long-term targets of 3% to 4% volume growth, 6% to 8% operating income growth and high-single-digit earnings growth and the picture of success for us is to exceed those and I think we currently will be disappointed if that is not the case. \nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: That\u2019s still the case this year?\nMuhtar Kent: We would be disappointed if that would be not the case. \nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay, yeah, thank you. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Bill Pecoriello with Morgan Stanley.\nBill Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley: Good morning, everybody. A question on -- as the bottlers are beginning to raise price further in the second half of \u201908 due to commodity increases, maybe as high as mid- to high-single-digit in the U.S., I think [Helenica] talked about mid-single-digit, will you be raising concentrate prices more than historically to offset any of the volume impact that you might suffer? Would you wait for January to raise the concentrate again? And are you trying to evaluate more incident-based pricing type models in these developed markets due to the inflationary outlook versus past practice? Thanks. \nMuhtar Kent: I don\u2019t think I want to go into the details of our concentrate arrangements with our bottlers but you can rest assured that -- I think firstly, please -- you know, it\u2019s important to understand that our bottlers\u2019 financial architecture today is much stronger than it used to be three, four years ago in terms of their ROICs, in terms of their cash positions, in terms of their willingness and appetite to invest in the marketplace, and again the commodity increases are impacting our bottlers in very different ways in different geographies, so it\u2019s wrong to assume that it\u2019s all going to be looking like the U.S. picture across the world in terms of its relationship to the revenue that the bottlers are generating out of the cases that they are selling.  But we have very good equitable arrangements in place with our bottlers to ensure that we remain very disciplined in the way we continue to invest in the marketplace, to continue to ensure that our brands are healthy, and continue to ensure that we gain volume and value share as we move forward in this environment. \nBill Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley: But in certain regions where the bottlers might have to take higher pricing, if you look at what we are seeing with the Procter & Gambles and other companies that are all raising prices, in your case as the bottlers would be raising, you might take more of the impact in your P&L but you obviously have levers, whether it be market support in concentrate, but you would be working with the bottlers on adjusting those levers, so you didn\u2019t suffer any harder impact from those increases. \nMuhtar Kent: Absolutely. The key word is to optimize volume and value and also the key word is equitable. \nBill Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Marc Greenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMarc Greenberg - Deutsche Bank: Thanks. Good morning, Muhtar. Today\u2019s results at CCE, weak volumes, $5 billion impairment, indication of another comprehensive business review, bear all the markings of a bottler that belongs in the hospital ward. Does Coke still believe the best go-to-market approach in the U.S. is with an independent bottler? And what might cause your point of view to change there?\nMuhtar Kent: Well firstly, I think we are continuing to work with CCE and all our bottlers to optimize our value and price to the consumer and customer in this challenging -- it is a challenging cost environment and that going forward, to grow value in a sustainable way to balance volume and share, as well as operating income. And we are relying on many aspects. Of course, I want to just reiterate that we are working very closely with CCE and all our bottlers. There is no question that we feel that this market has tremendous potential and that we will realize that potential. We have a much stronger portfolio. We have a very close working relationship and we have -- you know, I want to just reiterate, if your question is going that, that we have no plans in place to -- I\u2019ve said it before, any intention in acquiring the bottler that you talked about. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of John Faucher with J.P. Morgan.\nJohn Faucher - J.P. Morgan: Good morning. Thank you. You know, as you talked about all these one-time items, I guess the question would be as you\u2019ve cycled through some of them, it seems as though those should dissipate. And can you give us a clue -- have you seen any acceleration as we sort of cycled some of these? Again, talk as you went through the second quarter but also give us an idea, I realize it\u2019s only a couple of weeks into the third quarter, would you say the run-rate is improving as you move past some of these factors?\nMuhtar Kent: Well, John, first we don\u2019t provide mid-quarter updates, but I just want to say that we remain confident in the long-term prospects of the business, recognize that we are facing uncertain economic conditions but remain fully committed to delivering on our commitments. We do closely monitor the economic environment, market by market and I can tell you that we had very flexible plans in place to adjust our plans where appropriate in terms of packaging, price points, and as I reiterate, our picture of success continues to meet or exceed our long-term targets.  And in terms of -- I believe in statistics and probability and I do believe that the one-offs should not continue going forward. We may have other one-offs but I don\u2019t think that all of those will come together all in one quarter in that intensity.  Gary, you want to add to that?\nGary P. Fayard: John, let me see if I can add a little bit of context to it, in two different ways; one is you really have to talk about different countries, because there\u2019s a lot of volatility in the macroeconomic environment today. But let me give you a couple of examples -- Brazil, if I told you about Brazil for a minute and focus on it, it was 1% growth in the quarter. But it was a really bad April but actually returned to nice growth in May and June. If I look at in Europe at Germany or Great Britain, very bad April, return to growth in May and June.  But I can give you some examples that go the other way. It really depends on the country, so we think a lot of it is telling us it\u2019s kind of these one-off items but sure there\u2019s some macroeconomic environmental factors as well. But to try to quantify any of those would be kind of speculation on our part, so that\u2019s why we feel comfortable.  I guess the other point I would make though is we have a management team that\u2019s seen this before. We\u2019ve been through this before. In the late \u201890s, if you\u2019ll remember when it was much worse and the emerging markets were so tied to the U.S., and thank God they\u2019re not any longer. We\u2019ve been through this before and we know what to do and I think that\u2019s why we feel very confident with where we are and why we\u2019re gaining share. And we would expect in this kind of environment with our system and with our brands, we plan to come out of this much stronger, actually, than other companies in the industry. \nJohn Faucher - J.P. Morgan: Thanks. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Christine Farkas with Merrill Lynch.\nChristine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much. Good morning. Muhtar and Gary, I have just a housekeeping question; I\u2019m wondering if you can tell us how much Glaceau added to your North American volumes and were there any other ongoing or lingering issues with your large format water? And then I want to understand with your SG&A growth in the quarter, you\u2019ve talked about the bottler and brand acquisitions impacting that a lot. As we are cycling through this, if your acquisitions of bottlers slow, what kind of leverage could we hope to see there, or would you continue to expect the same kind of leverage once we cycle that impact?\nMuhtar Kent: I\u2019ll ask Gary to comment on the second piece of the question but in terms of Glaceau, it added two percentage points in the quarter for our North American business going forward, so that\u2019s the number that I think you were looking for. And then Gary, do you want to just take the piece on the SG&A?\nGary P. Fayard: On SG&A, what you would -- basically for the quarter, let me go through that again first, SG&A was up 16%. About eight points of that was currency, four points of it was structural, and about two points for brand acquisitions. So if you strip all that stuff out, apples-to-apples, OpEx was up about 2%; within that, marketing up in line, pretty much in line with gross profit, so you are seeing some pretty good leverage coming from tight control on G&A spend within that.  Now related to that, we put some of those programs into place late last year, so we\u2019ll start cycling those. We\u2019ll continue to see leverage but it will be less than what we\u2019ve seen in the first half of this year, which was about four points of leverage in the quarter. \nChristine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. And then on your currency, Gary, have you indicated what you plan to spend that back on, or is that embedded into your plans of what you\u2019ve discussed?\nGary P. Fayard: It\u2019s embedded in the plans. We actually are aggressively managing, portfolio managing, and we have increased spend in some areas but at the same time, we\u2019re being very disciplined on spending back, that it needs to have a long-term return for us and so we\u2019re very disciplined in what we are spending. So that\u2019s why you see a lot of the currency benefit coming through, dropping right to the bottom line because we are continuing to spend in line with our plans. We\u2019ve increased that somewhat as we portfolio manage as well, but you know our plans already have significant marketing spend behind the Olympics and Euro 2008, so I think we are very well-positioned in marketing. When we see opportunities, we\u2019ll jump on it but at the same time, if it\u2019s not a good financial -- long-term financial decision, we\u2019ll be very disciplined and it will flow through, as it did this quarter. \nChristine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Securities. \nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: Good morning. Gary, a question on the restructuring charges and savings, a couple of questions; first, just all the spending will be all cash? Were there any write-downs or is the amount you are going to spend to generate the charges going to be all cash?\nGary P. Fayard: Bryan, I would say that most of it will be cash. There will be some write-downs on facilities, et cetera, that we closed. The example -- the current example would be that we just closed one of our concentrate plants in Ireland. We announced that last fall. It actually closed in June, so last month, and in that you had cash restructuring charges as well as a write-down of the plant itself, all within that restructuring. So you will have some of both but I would say probably tend more toward the cash side, both on the savings and on the restructuring charges to achieve those savings.  \nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: Okay, and then will there be any capitalized spending associated with this as well?\nGary P. Fayard: Not really anything of any significance, no. \nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: Okay, and then in terms of just how we flow what you\u2019re spending versus the savings, is the 25% per year the way we should think about the spending, or are you going to spend more up-front and the savings come through more gradually?\nGary P. Fayard: You know, we\u2019re going to do this one the way you would really like it to be done. It\u2019s almost we\u2019re trying to achieve a kind of 25% per year on both sides, so it\u2019s going to be fairly well matched. \nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: Okay, great. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.\nKaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Good morning, everyone. First, if we could talk about marketing a bit, can you comment if, given what\u2019s happening to the economy, if you are shifting some of your marketing strategies potentially maybe from advertising over to promotions in areas like the United States? And then also, as it relates to the economy, as we think about Western and Eastern Europe where private label is a little stronger, can you talk about if you are seeing any trading down?\nMuhtar Kent: I think not just in the United States or Europe, but everywhere we remain very flexible and in fact, you see us shifting some of our emphasis in our marketing programs but not just in marketing programs but also in the area of packaging, ensuring that we remain affordable and ensure that we can continue to capture all beverage opportunities around the world. And I think that what you see us doing is to make sure that we remain relevant to the consumer and also that our key partnerships with all our key customers, small or large, continue around the world.  I think that we will do whatever is necessary to ensure that we can keep maximizing our growth and also gaining volume and value share in all our markets. In Europe, specific to your question about discounters, what you see us actually is that we are gaining availability in discounters quarter by quarter in Europe, including not just in legal but all key discounters. So you see us being more relevant now with our different formats across east as well as across Western Europe. What we see is that in these times, consumers find it easier to make decisions to buy affordable luxuries, like our products. And I think that our strategies are working because we are gaining market share across all our key markets. In 17 of our top markets, we\u2019ve gained both volume and value share and I think that you will see that continuing as we move into the balance of the year. \nKaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Good morning, thanks. Gary, just a clarification; I didn\u2019t understand your comment about the productivity savings in the Q&A with Bryan. When you said on both sides matching, were you saying you plan to spend back those savings pretty much at a 125 per annum, or 100 per annum depending on the total number between now and 2011? \nGary P. Fayard: Yes, Mark. Basically as the savings com through, the costs will come through at about the same amount, so -- \nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Oh, that was a reference to the charge, but what about where those savings actually -- you know, to the extent to which they hit the bottom line?\nMuhtar Kent: Let me just reflect on that. I mean, what you will see us doing is -- you know, because we\u2019re realizing some of those savings as we speak and what you see us doing is ensuring that we spend some of it against our brands to keep our brands healthy and relevant, and then some of it will go into leverage on our P&L. So you will see us spending some of it and then using to ensure that we continue our leverage on our P&L. But what Gary was explaining was the costs to realize those savings as opposed to how we were going to spend the money. \nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Thank you, guys. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Lauren Torres with HSBC.\nLauren Torres - HSBC: Good morning. You updated us on your commodity cost guidance for the Coca-Cola Company for this year. I was just wondering if you wanted to make some comments just with respect to the Coke system. Obviously costs are getting that much tougher. What\u2019s your expectation for the system? And just also if you could be a bit more specific about what you are doing with your bottlers really just to manage these cost pressures? Thanks. \nMuhtar Kent: I think there\u2019s a -- we see a fairly big difference between how the outlook looks in the United States and how the outlook looks around the world. I think I made a brief comment on that earlier when I was answering an earlier question, but what you see is that in the United States, clearly we see a much higher number than we\u2019ve experienced in the past, maybe around 5%, 6%, this year and then double-digits next year. But certainly in terms of the international environment, I think you see a very different -- huge differences in different countries but certainly a much smaller amount in terms of how we see it in 2008 and also how we see it going forward. Both what you see in Eastern Europe or Western Europe, it is much, much lower than the numbers in the United States.  So as a system, what we see is low-single-digits in 2008 and it is still difficult to assess exactly where it\u2019s going to land in 2009. \nLauren Torres - HSBC: But with that in mind, thinking about your relationship and how you are working with your U.S. bottlers this year, what initiatives would support -- you know, how do we think about your relationship and support with respect to these cost increases and how you can help offset that in partnership with your bottlers?\nMuhtar Kent: As I said, we are continuing to work very, very closely with CCE and our bottlers to optimize value and price to the consumer and customer. It is a challenging environment and I think we are basically aligned in how we go forward on the importance of immediate consumption to build our brands, on the importance of investments in packaging differentiation and capabilities, and on the continued investment in customer capabilities. So you see us having a significant number of initiatives, also on supply chain optimization. And I\u2019d like to turn to Sandy to give you a little more detail on that. \nSandy Douglas: Good morning, everyone. The principal focus of our plan this year with our bottlers has continued to move aggressively on productivity initiatives and to bring support forward to support both packaging and marketing programs to drive growth. We expect the system to look for pricing improvement in the balance of the year in a balanced way to try to begin to recover margins while at the same time protecting consumer and customer value, and all of our investment is focused on helping the system achieve that in a balance way while at the same time growing the health of the brands. \nMuhtar Kent: I just want to reiterate, in the United States we have a much richer portfolio, a much better architecture in our portfolio and brands in our stable in the still beverage category. Our three cola strategy is gaining traction and I think that we certainly will continue to build on our rich still beverage portfolio, growing -- the fastest growing still beverage -- to remain the fastest growing still beverage portfolio, led by Glaceau and Fuse and Simply Juices but also to ensure that we continue to drive relevance to our consumer base with our three cola strategy in the sparkling category. \nLauren Torres - HSBC: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Carlos Laboy with Credit Suisse.\nCarlos Laboy - Credit Suisse: Good morning, everyone. Muhtar, I was hoping you could give us a more detailed update on your company-owned bottlers. Who\u2019s the best performing bottler of these this past quarter, what\u2019s working there, and similarly, who is still in deep trouble?  And for Gary, is this macro environment risk putting those company-owned bottling earnings advances back into reverse, or for those growth rates to stall out on us here? \nMuhtar Kent: I think that all our actual company bottling operations are gaining traction. They are enhancing margin, they are growing, they are gaining market share in their territories and both China, Philippines, improving distribution, gaining market share in both those environments, as well as in Germany, I think we are gaining very good traction and leveraging the current architecture as a single bottling system, working much closer with customers. Germany is an area where we\u2019ve gained tremendous traction with all retailers, including discounters, where we are very successful with our different packaging and formats and portfolio.  You know, across Latin America, the CBO is doing very well. Scandinavia again, we\u2019re gaining traction and doing very well. And across the financial performance continues to improve and our volumes are very much in line or better than the general market in all the territories. \nGary P. Fayard: And relative to those, let me just echo basically what Muhtar just said as well, Carlos. The volume within the bottling investments group, in fact, organic volume was up 6%, so they are performing really well in this environment. Income is up significant and ongoing operating income margins increased 120 basis points, kind of ongoing, so these bottlers, while they were in the hospital ward, I think the BIG group is doing a very good job of managing them across the world, and in fact we\u2019re seeing improving results pretty much everywhere.  So I don\u2019t anticipate any big issues there. \nCarlos Laboy - Credit Suisse: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Todd Divek with Banc of America Securities. \nTodd Divek - Banc of America: Good morning. Gary, I guess this question is primarily for you; the financial markets have been very difficult and some of the financial firms have had to raise additional capital and Suntrust has been one of those that\u2019s been speculated. Given that they own a significant number of shares, can you just refresh our memory in terms of what the policy is towards buying back shares directly from Suntrust? Is there an agreement in place?\nGary P. Fayard: Thanks, Todd, for the question. Suntrust does own directly about 44 million shares of the company stock, going back to the original IPO of the company. They have announced plans during this quarter that they are looking at ways to enhance their capital position, and one of the ways to do that could involve either the sale of or some kind of other type transaction involving the Coke shares that they directly own.  They have not announced what if anything they\u2019ve done at this point. I believe their earnings release and quarterly call is on I think Tuesday of next week, so I would expect -- I think they have said that they expected to have something in place by the end of this quarter, so I would expect all of us to learn on Tuesday exactly where they are. \nTodd Divek - Banc of America: Okay, that\u2019s helpful, and just a follow-up; with respect to your comments in the prepared remarks about deferring long-term debt issuance that you had planned for this fall, is that primarily to pre-finance some long-term debt that matures next spring? Or are you planning to term out additional debt that is currently in short-term debt?\nGary P. Fayard: We were actually looking at terming out some of the acquisition debt from the Glaceau transaction. It\u2019s just we have a commercial paper program in place that we\u2019re in the market basically every day. We have not had a single issue at all in our commercial paper program. We probably are paying lower than almost anybody else in the world. I mean, we\u2019ve got a great program there.  As we look at, as interest rates have come down but as we look at the spreads on longer term debt, we just have concluded that it\u2019s really just not worth paying those kinds of spreads and we are going to stay short, as we have for the last year or so. And because of that, we have put this interest rate lock in in anticipation of probably issuing some debt. This summer, we\u2019re not going to do that. As I said, we\u2019ll defer that as we continue to watch the spreads over treasuries, and we made $17 million on the deal. \nTodd Divek - Banc of America: Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much. \nAnn Taylor: Operator, we have time for one last question. \nOperator: Thank you. This morning\u2019s final question will come from the line of Karen [Lamarc] with Federated Investors.\nKaren Lamarc - Federated Investors: Good morning. I wonder if you can give us a little bit more color on the step-up in the non-currency related CapEx, as maybe what changed or what made you realize that you wanted to step up the investment [side]? Thanks. \nGary P. Fayard: Thanks, Karen. Of the about $200 million step-up, as I said about half of that -- about $100 million of that is really just due to currency. The other 100 is really about the timing around our bottling investment group. If you think about it, they are growing nicely, as I said a few minutes ago when I was talking to Carlos, they are growing nicely, we continue to invest in the bottling investments group. Because of the planning cycle, we are going ahead and spending some money now in orders so that we\u2019ve got equipment, lines, et cetera in place for the summer selling season next year. So we\u2019re just accelerating some plans really from placing orders in January to now.  And additionally, we are starting to build a new concentrate type facility as well, and that\u2019s going to add a little bit of cost in this fall. \nKaren Lamarc - Federated Investors: Great, thanks very much. \nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Neville, Gary, and Sandy, and thanks to each of you for joining us this morning. I\u2019m excited to lead this great company and I am confident our strategies are working. The fundamentals of our business and the strength of our brands remain strong. We are focused on the initiatives that will drive our results, execution in the marketplace, and outward focus on our customers and consumers, and diligence with capital and expense allocation. I am very excited about the next phase of our journey to create a true, sustainable growth company. Thank you very much. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Coca-Cola Company\u2019s second quarter 2008 earnings results conference call.

Of Virginia Anthony Vocallo - Credit Suisse Marion Montagne\nOperator: Good morning. My name is Dennis and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s first quarter 2008 earnings results conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would like to now introduce Ann Taylor, Vice President and Director of Investor Relations. \nAnn Taylor: Good morning and thank you for being with us today. I am joined by Neville Isdell, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Muhtar Kent, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Gary Fayard, our Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions.  Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company\u2019s most recent SEC report.  In addition, I would also like to note that we have posted schedules on our company website at www.thecocacolacompany.com under the financial information tab in the investors section, which reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to by our senior executives in our discussion this morning and from time to time in discussing our financial performance to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. Please look on our website for this information.  Now let me turn the call over to Neville. \nNeville Isdell: Thank you, Ann and good morning, everyone. I am going to start this morning with just a few brief observations about our first quarter results and Muhtar will then provide details on the operational performance and the strategies we are employing, and that will be followed by Gary\u2019s overview of financials and some additional perspective on 2008.  Well, we are off to a good start for 2008 further building on our success in 2007. The strength of our brand portfolio, the breadth of our global system, and the winning culture that thrives throughout the system continue to drive our business forward.  I am particularly pleased with our performance in the first quarter given the very strong comparables from the prior year and the challenging U.S. economic environment. We once again proved our ability to successfully manage our portfolio of brands and geographies and through that over time to deliver balanced growth.  We continue to see the benefit of successfully executing our system strategies together with our bottling partners and thus driving strong top and bottom line results. We achieved volume growth of 6% in the quarter, successfully cycling 6% growth in the prior year. This is now the 12th consecutive quarter that we\u2019ve achieved volume results of 4% or greater.  Revenue growth was robust at 21%. The acquisition of bottlers contributed 5% to this growth, such that even excluding this impact revenues grew a very strong 16%.  Ongoing operating income increased 19%, with currency contributing 11%. So our currency neutral operating income increased 8% while as before, we are continuing to make strategic long-term investments behind our brands.  And notably, this is our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable EPS growth.  Now once again our international operations drove our results, delivering unit case volume growth of 7%, even while successfully cycling 9% growth in the prior year. Importantly, the growth continues to be sourced from developed and emerging markets. All operating groups delivered growth with the exception of Africa, which had a challenging cycle of 17% growth last year but also significant power shortages in South Africa which impacted the results. Even in North America, we achieved slight growth despite the difficult macroeconomic environment.  The current strength of our portfolio also enabled us to deliver balanced growth. Sparkling beverages unit case volume increased 3% in the quarter with our international operations delivery 5% growth on top of 8% in the prior year. This growth was led by trademark Coca-Cola and the continued expansion and strong performance of Coca-Cola Zero, which is now in 81 markets. This is particularly noteworthy given that we are now cycling the successful launches that took place in 2006 and 2007. Additionally, trademarks Fanta and Sprite delivered 2% and 6% growth respectively.  Still beverage unit case volume increased 17%, driven by robust growth across our portfolio of juice, tea, and water brands.  Clearly our strategies are working and we are expanding our volume and value share relationship position in the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry, as well as in sparkling beverages and key still beverage categories.  As I enter my final quarter as CEO, I am pleased with our accomplishments and our solid performance. We have put in place a strong foundation and I remain confident in our outlook for 2008. Our well-balanced geographic mix and broad portfolio gives us a unique position from which to manage through current headwinds.  So with that, let me now turn the call over to Muhtar to provide the details on our operations. Muhtar. \nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Neville and good morning, everyone. Overall, this was another solid quarter for the Coca-Cola Company, again characterized by balanced growth across countries and across brands. As Neville indicated, our performance in the quarter was once again led by our international operations, where we continue to reap the benefits of our scale, our world-class franchise leadership, and the successful execution of our clearly defined strategies to drive growth and address key issue markets.  We continue to make significant investments for the long-term in our BRIC markets. In the emerging markets, we focus on realizing profitable growth and continue to expand our leadership positions in our developed markets with value growth.  Our performance in 2007 and thus far in 2008 underscores this approach and we believe enables us to appropriately manage our portfolio for balanced and sustained growth as we track emerging macroeconomic trends.  The international business growth in our emerging markets remained strong. For the quarter we achieved double-digit growth in key emerging markets including China, India, Russia, Brazil, Turkey, the Philippines, as well as Eastern Europe. Double-digit unit case volume growth in trademark Coca-Cola drove the results in most of these markets, whilst we continue to rapidly expand our still portfolio with the continued success of Minute Maid Pulpy, the strong growth of our sparkling and still portfolio in Russia, and the launch of the new mainstream tea Original Leaf in China. Additionally, China continues to leverage the Olympic Games to drive positive performance.  In our Eurasia and Pacific groups, we delivered strong growth of 13% and 10% respectively, primarily driven by the solid performance of these emerging markets. In Eurasia, we are improving our share trend and are delivering balanced healthy growth across all key countries. And in the Pacific group, we are continuing to invest for future growth and achieving non-alcoholic ready-to-drink volume and value share gains.  Japan\u2019s performance reflects our efforts to successfully stabilize our business. Japan achieved slight unit case volume growth in the quarter, cycling 3% from the previous year. This is now the sixth consecutive quarter of growth in Japan. Sparkling beverage volume growth was led by trademark Coca-Cola, which increased double-digits, benefiting from the successful execution of our three cola strategy. Georgia Coffee for the second consecutive quarter also delivered growth.  We launched a new marketing campaign which is connecting well with consumers. We are continuing to innovate around the brand with new flavors, new packaging, as well as marketing initiatives to drive further growth.  The European group demonstrated it has established a solid foundation from which to deliver balanced broad-based geographic and brand growth. Europe achieved 3% unit case volume growth in the quarter, successfully cycling 11% from the prior year. Importantly, key countries delivered solid growth in the quarter -- Germany growing unit case volume at 2%, successfully cycling 11% as we continue to expand our availability in the fast-growing discounted channel.  We continue to be encouraged by our progress in Great Britain, which increased unit case volume mid-single-digits and delivered its second consecutive quarter of growth.  Europe also achieved balanced portfolio growth with sparkling beverages growing 2% and still beverages increasing 14%. Sparkling beverage growth was led by the continued success of Coke Zero and our three cola strategy which jointly drove category share gains in the quarter. Coca-Cola Zero has now been launched in 26 countries in Europe and continues to recruit drinkers back into the category.  We also continue to create innovation in the category with the launch of Coca-Cola Light Plus in France, a product offering vitamins and minerals and now in six international markets.  The expansion in still beverages was driven by double-digit organic growth in Nestea, Aquarius, Powerade, and Burn. The brand performance led to volume and value share gains in still beverages for the entire group.  Additionally, I am pleased that our global joint venture with illycaff\u00e8, a premium brand of ready-to-drink coffee is now launching in 10 European countries. European consumers will now be able to enjoy three premium espresso based offerings, and this is a great example of an idea moving from conception to the marketplace in less than a year. We believe this partnership is going to enhance our global leadership in the fast-growing, high value, ready-to-drink coffee category.  Latin America delivered strong results in the first quarter and continues to be a dynamic story for our company. Unit case volume increased 9% with all business units delivering solid growth. In Mexico, unit case volume increased 11%. Continued solid organic growth was led by a mid-single-digit unit case volume increase in trademark Coca-Cola.   Key marketing initiatives around Coke and [Mills] and the Happiness Factory 2 campaigns led to volume and value share gains. We are successfully integrating also Jugos del Valle into our system and while it\u2019s early days, it is performing ahead of our expectations.  In Africa, unit case volume in the quarter declined 1%, cycling strong growth of 17% in the prior quarter. South Africa in particular had a challenging 29% prior year growth rate to cycle, which reflected the replenishment of trade inventories due to CO2 shortages at the end of \u201906. Additionally, CO2 shortages in the current quarter also contributed to the 9% volume decline in South Africa.  Our system is currently investing in manufacturing capability that would allow us to produce our own supply of CO2 and therefore minimizes the impact on us in the -- which will minimize the impact on us in the future.  Now I would like to move to North America. As you are well aware, we faced a challenging macroeconomic environment in the first quarter which not only affected our North America business but also negatively impacted the U.S. beverage industry as a whole. Specifically, our food service and other on-premise businesses were hit the hardest. However, our consistent focus on executing our strategies and our commitment to winning enabled us to deliver slight unit case volume growth in the quarter.  While our performance in North America is not where we want it to be, I am encouraged by the steadfastness of our teams. Despite the overall U.S. industry volume declining in the first quarter, we actually gained volume and value share. I am confident that we have the right strategies in place to deliver against our goals. We will continue to invest behind our brands as well as customer relationships while improving our in-market execution.  We continue to execute our three cola strategy. In the quarter, our U.S. business achieved share gains in core sparkling beverages led by Coca-Cola Classic, Diet Coca-Cola, and Coca-Cola Zero each gaining share. Coca-Cola Zero continued to drive strong growth, achieving more than 40% volume growth, two-and-a-half years after launch, cycling in fact 27% growth from prior year.  On the marketing side, we are investing in brand building activities and connecting to the passion points of our consumers through our Super Bowl advertising, sponsorship of American Idol, the NCAA Final Four, as well as Daytona 500 activation.  Importantly, our still beverage portfolio continues to outperform the industry, driven by the strong performance from Glaceau, Fuse, and our warehouse Chill Juice business. Glaceau and Fuse continue to perform ahead of expectations, reflecting increased availability as well as velocity through our hybrid distribution model. These acquisitions remain a key catalyst for our overall business in North America, creating greater alignment between us and our bottling partners, as well as providing resources to continue to invest behind our total portfolio.  In the first quarter, we began the international expansion of Glaceau first in Australia. We will continue to strategically look at other markets to expand the brand throughout 2008.  As Neville and I have been saying for the past several quarters, we are committed to restoring growth to North America and have taken important steps to put us on the right track. Despite the challenging environment, in 2008 we will continue to invest along with our bottling partners for growth. We are aligned with our bottling system and our customers behind a strong marketing calendar for the remainder of the year.  Overall, I am pleased with our performance in the first quarter. However, we continue to recognize there is still much more work to be done, particularly in North America. Globally, our performance going forward will be underpinned by the successful execution of our five strategic priorities, which I have previously laid out. I am committed to continuing improvement in the execution of our strategies.  Even in the face of a challenging economic environment, I am confident that by leveraging the scale and power of our brands, our consumer base, customer network, and franchise system to capture the greatest share of opportunity while carefully managing our expenses, we will achieve another successful year of growth for the Coca-Cola Company and create value for our shareowners.  Now let me turn the call over to Gary. \nGary P. Fayard: Thanks, Muhtar and good morning, everyone. As Neville and Muhtar indicated, we are starting the year with solid financial results. As you saw in the release, we reported earnings per share of $0.64 per share on a diluted basis for the first quarter, an increase of 19%. This included a net charge primarily related to restructuring charges and asset write-downs of $0.03 per share. Therefore our adjusted EPS was $0.67 per share, an increase of 20% after considering items impacting comparability in both the current and prior year. This is now our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable EPS growth.  Net revenue in the quarter increased 21%, which included a 5% benefit from structural changes primarily related to our acquisition of bottlers. The growth was driven by 5% increase in concentrate sales, a 9% increase from currency, and a 2% favorable impact from price mix.  In the quarter, unit case volume increased 6%, which we report on an average daily sales basis. There was one less day this quarter than in the prior year quarter. Therefore on a reported basis, unit cases and concentrate sales are in line for the quarter.  In the quarter, the impact of one less day was offset by the shift of Easter into the first quarter, so really no net P&L impact. The second quarter will be impacted by the shift of the Easter holiday into the first quarter but also note that in the fourth quarter of this year, we will have two additional days.  We grew operating income by 15% on a reported basis. After considering items impacting comparability in the current and prior year quarter, operating income increased 19%, which includes an 11% benefit from currencies. So on an ongoing currency neutral basis, we grew operating income 8%.  SG&A on an ongoing basis increased 21% in the quarter. About 17 points of that increase was due to bottler and brand acquisition, increased sales and service expenses as we invested for growth in our bottling operations and from currency. The remaining four points were from our continued investment behind our brands, while controlling G&A expenses as we focus on productivity and expense management.  Additionally, we continue to see margins improve in both our core business as well as in our bottling investment group. Our continued focus on driving efficiency and effectiveness throughout our organization generated three points of operating expense leverage on our core business.  Cash from operations for the quarter increased 18% to $1.1 billion on the strong underlying business performance.  In the quarter, we repurchased approximately $309 million of our stock. We still anticipate that our range for share repurchase for the full year will be between $1.5 billion and $2 billion.  Now let me address some of the factors we see impacting the remainder of 2008. We remain confident in our ability to achieve long-term sustainable growth despite the slowdown in the U.S. economy, given our balanced geographic mix and brand portfolio. As you have seen from our results, our international markets, particularly our emerging markets, have maintained their strong performance even against a difficult economic environment in the U.S.  Globally, we have strong aligned plans in place with our bottling partners for the remainder of the year which reflect the realities of the local economic conditions. We will continue to portfolio manage globally as we expect solid performance in most of our markets with softness in North America, as our business in North America will continue to be impacted by the difficult economic environment in the near-term.  From a commodity cost perspective, our assumptions are unchanged. We would expect a slight increase for the system and essentially flat for the company. From a capital expenditure standpoint, we purchased approximately $372 million in net property, plant, and equipment during the quarter. For 2008, we continue to expect total company net capital expenditures to be approximately $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, as we make investments primarily in our acquired bottling operations.  With regard to taxes, we ended up the quarter with an underlying effective tax rate of 22% and we expect to remain at that underlying rate for the remainder of the year.  Finally, let me move to currency -- as I mentioned, we saw a positive impact from currency for the quarter on operating income of 11%. This was clearly ahead of our previous expectations, given the change in market rates late in the quarter.  We are effectively covered for the full year on the YEN and the Euro and I would remind everyone that in our hedging strategy, we use an option strategy so we maintain all of the upside in currencies.  Based on current market rate expectations for the remainder of the year and benefits of coverage in place, we would expect currency benefits on ongoing operating income for the full year to be in the mid single digit range.  Given the greater than expected currency benefit, the company is evaluating whether there might be opportunities to reinvest a portion of the currency benefit in marketing programs and productivity initiatives to drive long-term sustainable growth.  That\u2019s what I wanted to cover this morning. Operator, if we can now turn it over for questions. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from the line of Christine Farkas with Merrill Lynch.\nChristine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much. There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s growing here but I want to focus on the segment that isn\u2019t and that\u2019s North America. I\u2019m wondering, Muhtar, in looking at your margins for the quarter, which were down substantially year over year, we know that Glaceau is probably a lower margin business while your fountain business is also a lower margin business and that was down. Can you just kind of go through perhaps those factors or other factors and how they might have impacted structurally the margin structure in North America?\nMuhtar Kent: I\u2019ll just reflect on first the margins. Firstly, I think what you see is that Glaceau is adding of course revenue at a higher rate than it\u2019s adding obviously income in terms of how it comes into the business and how it is reflected in the P&L, so you do see a greater, a higher benefit from revenues versus income when you add Glaceau numbers to our total numbers.  Secondly, certainly in terms of the food service, both cost of goods sold are impacted by freight, by HFCS, and we are continuing to invest in our marketing programs. But overall, I think that we have also a lot of supply chain initiatives that we are working on in our North American business and not all of them have been coming and bearing fruit in Q1. \nGary P. Fayard: If I could add one thing to that, remember on Glaceau that while on a percentage margin basis, it would not be -- the margins are not as high. On a pennies, profit per case basis it is actually higher. So Glaceau is very positive for us from an absolute P&L point of view. So really what you are seeing is some cost of goods and some mix with food service and sparkling down for the quarter. \nChristine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: As well as some investment itself. Thank you. \nGary P. Fayard: Correct and we are continuing to invest behind the brands in fact globally in every market. \nChristine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Thanks a lot, gentlemen. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Bill Pecoriello with Morgan Stanley.\nBill Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley: Good morning, everybody. Congratulations on a strong quarter. I also had a question on North America. Aside from the weak food service business, the retail business was also flattish if you exclude acquisitions and I wanted to try and understand some of the other factors that could be playing a role there. Do you see -- you mentioned that you think the Coke system gained volume share. We saw Pepsi very promotional over Easter in some channels. Was that a factor? On the bottler execution, any distraction as the Glaceau, which is exceeding your expectations, is being integrated, is that having any impact? And then as you look at the balance of the year and trying to grow the business, would the U.S. be a prime candidate for getting any disproportionate reinvestment on the foreign currency upsides that you were referring to? Thanks. \nMuhtar Kent: Firstly, as I indicated overall industry declined in the U.S. but we have gained total beverage volume and value share in terms of the quarter, so I want to highlight that and our still beverage portfolio also continues to outperform the industry and Glaceau and Fuse continue to perform ahead of our expectations. And therefore, looking into the second half of the year, we remain confident that we do have the right strategies in place. It\u2019s a difficult environment and in terms of what is being impacted in the bottle and can side of the business is also the immediate consumption side of the business that is impacted more because of the way -- how the consumer sentiment is currently reflecting into the total industry.  So I want to just highlight that the retail performed -- our retail business performed better than the industry and there\u2019s a move from on-premise to more home consumption and we are reflecting our marketing programs to -- realigning our marketing programs all the time on a flexible basis to ensure that we can capture whatever opportunities are out there. But there\u2019s no question that the food side of the business is more challenging at the moment, the food service side. \nNeville Isdell: Just to add on the -- your comment about the end of March and our competitor, that does happen at the end of a quarter sometimes from a competitor. We have got a very balanced plan for the full year and we don\u2019t react as it were week by week, and you know we\u2019ve had a very strong quarter. So that -- from a share standpoint and that\u2019s because of the integrity of our programs and the way that we work in conjunction with our bottlers. \nBill Pecoriello - Morgan Stanley: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Lauren Torres with HSBC.\nLauren Torres - HSBC: Good morning. Latin America was once again a strong market for you in this quarter. I was just hoping you could talk more about how the weakness in the U.S. has or may carry over to potential weakness in Latin America, particularly in Mexico. Have you seen evidence of this or are you at least concerned about a slow down in these markets?\nMuhtar Kent: Lauren, we have not yet seen any evidence of any slow down in Latin America at the moment. There\u2019s -- we also -- we all read about the remittances from the United States having gone down significantly to Mexico at the moment but right now from -- in terms of the market sentiment, in terms of the consumer sentiment, we have not yet seen any impact not just in Mexico but across all of Latin America. We haven\u2019t yet seen any but certainly that could be a risk going forward but we have certainly not seen anything at the moment. \nLauren Torres - HSBC: But so far with respect to volume and pricing, it\u2019s been well accepted and you\u2019ve seen some good momentum there?\nMuhtar Kent: Absolutely, yes. \nLauren Torres - HSBC: Okay. Thank you. \nNeville Isdell: Lauren, just to add, I was actually in two of the smaller markets, Chile and Peru, a few weeks ago and there\u2019s a vibrancy in Latin America that I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen in decades and reflect in those some other markets, which are actually going to be -- they are not obviously of the size of the ones that we normally focus on but from an incremental standpoint are going to be important as we go forward. So I think this is also true globally. We look at the BRICs as we should and we will continue to but again around them are some other markets, the Vietnams, et cetera, Philippines, where there is significant incremental growth for us as we go forward. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of John Faucher with J.P. Morgan.\nJohn Faucher - J.P. Morgan: Good morning, everyone. I was wondering if you could update us in terms of any further thoughts on spinning off some of the company owned bottlers. The margin improvement there has been very impressive. It seems like you\u2019ve got great plans there. How is the spin-off of sort of the better functioning, the ones you\u2019ve made better going to impact your margin targets and your growth targets in terms of looking at the bottling operations? Thanks. \nNeville Isdell: John, let me give you a headline comment and then pass it over to Muhtar. We\u2019ve consistently said that, as you know, it will be our plan to divest. However, we really need to get these large bottlers, some of which we have only recently acquired, if you take China, if you take the Philippines, into really good shape before we move them on. So for the larger ones, nothing immediate whatsoever and I\u2019ll let Muhtar pick it up from there on some of the others. \nMuhtar Kent: The key for us is that first we need to assure ourselves that we\u2019ve got it right and working where we want it to be in terms of the conditions that we\u2019ve brought -- improved inside the operational side of the bottlers that we own. That\u2019s point number one and you\u2019ve seen us talk about -- you know, [Ramill] has now found itself the right home and you\u2019ll see us doing more of that as we move forward.  We\u2019re working on this investment of a portion of our equity in our Pakistan CBOs at the moment and again, that\u2019s because we feel the timing is right and we will move forward with that. And as we move into the future, you will see us employing different strategies. It\u2019s not just going out and selling but structural also strategies to make sure that we have the right structures in place for the right markets as we move forward into our bigger bottling investments, whether it be Germany or whether it be Philippines or whether it be China or whether it be India. \nGary P. Fayard: I guess I would add one other thing as well -- as we look to dispose of bottlers, and you\u2019ll see some of those as Muhtar said this year and in fact, this second quarter. The other thing we look for is ensuring that the bottling partner that we are going to sell to has the capability not only financially because we want a long-term sustainable successful bottler when we sell, but also has the management capability, the operational capability to maintain the momentum once we\u2019ve corrected these bottlers and continue for the long-term success of the system. So we are being very careful in who we sell to and what we do and we are selling for fair prices as well. We are not trying to maximize big gains. We\u2019re trying to maximize long-term sustainable results as we go forward. \nMuhtar Kent: Just one add-on, John, and don\u2019t -- take what we are doing also in the face of ensuring that we may now own a bottler but we may have a -- we may employ a structural difference that will benefit our system as we move forward. Example is Korea where now we have a local partner, very effective. We are working -- we have totally aligned and we\u2019ve actually generated growth in the quarter in Korea for the first time in many quarters and we are confident about the future there. So the main purpose is to ensure that we have the right structure in place for the future benefit of creating sustainable value and growth in that market. \nJohn Faucher - J.P. Morgan: Okay and then Gary, to your point on the second quarter, I mean, I\u2019m assuming you are going to sell off the smaller bottlers, so I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s not going to be much of a P&L dilution impact there but any advice in terms of how we model it or is it just too much of a rounding error to say there is really not going to be any noticeable dilution?\nGary P. Fayard: There\u2019s not going to be noticeable dilution and in fact on [Ramill], and for those that don\u2019t know [Ramill], it\u2019s one of the bottlers that we own in Brazil that we\u2019ve announced that we are selling to Femsa, we actually had planned to sell it. It was in our plan so everything we\u2019ve said about 2008 off the year-end call today, we\u2019ve had it in our plans the whole time so it\u2019s not that significant. \nJohn Faucher - J.P. Morgan: Thanks. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Good morning, everyone. I wanted to go back to North America and I appreciate the comment that you guys are gaining market share here but just looking at the broader industry and looking at the significant slowdown that we\u2019ve seen in some of the higher growth segments in the still segment, like ready-to-drink teas, sports drinks, energy drinks, et cetera, I\u2019m just wondering if you can talk about what are really the drivers of the weakness. Is it purely just a consumer weakness? Is there any concern that these segments are now becoming a bit more mature and that the growth rate is slowing down in some of these segments? Because it looks like the total LRB segment has seen a slowdown and it really seems to be coming from the slowdown from some of these higher growth segments. \nMuhtar Kent: Good morning. Firstly, just reiterating that our strategic focus is to ensure that we are the fastest growing still beverage company in North America and our still beverage portfolio is outperforming the industry. Total still beverages for us grew 10%, double-digits, in the quarter. Warehouse chill juices, led by simply trademark and Minute Maid enhanced juices grew and gained share. Glaceau and Fuse are continuing to perform ahead of our expectations and we do still see growth ahead in those categories, in the still categories and the challenges around North America, as I said before, are about the food service side and about the immediate consumption side and those are -- we are addressing those as I said with refocus programs. \nGary P. Fayard: Judy, I would add a couple of things. We have always said that our food service business is a leading indicator of the U.S. economy and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing now. It by the way as a leading indicator will be one of the things that tell us actually that we are coming out of the economic issues that we are currently seeing in the U.S., so you are seeing a lot of channel driven issues, food service, and it\u2019s just traffic is down. And you are also seeing the impact of the price of gasoline and people are staying at home, more future consumption versus immediate consumption, and that is truly just the economic conditions that we are seeing. \nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay, and then Gary, if I could just get a clarification on your comment about the outlook for the remainder of the year, I think you said that you are confident that you can achieve the long-term growth targets. I think in the beginning of the year, you\u2019ve talked about your picture of success this year being -- exceeding those long-term growth targets and I\u2019m just trying to see if there is any change in the thinking there. \nGary P. Fayard: No, in fact -- thank you for asking that. We were, in all candor, debating before the call whether we put it in the script and told you or waited for you to ask the question, so I\u2019m glad you asked the question.  Our picture of success is that we should exceed our long-term growth targets and I\u2019ll go further and tell you, without telling you exactly what they are, the metrics in our incentive plans for our compensation are in excess of our long-term growth targets. \nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay, and then just final question, Gary, on your corporate expense line, it was down significantly year over year. Is that basically driven by some of the cost-savings initiatives bearing fruit and is that a pretty good run-rate to use going forward?\nGary P. Fayard: It\u2019s a good run-rate for this year and it is definitely part of our productivity initiatives. A lot of that is coming through in some health costs that we\u2019ve taken some real initiatives around that to control some of those benefit costs. We\u2019ve been doing -- and we are doing that in all areas of the business, so you\u2019ll see us continuing with a real focus on controlling G&A expenses as we go forward. \nMuhtar Kent: Judy, just to add on to that, what we strive for always in all the productivity initiatives is that they result in some leverage on our P&L and if you look at the core business, you see that we have achieved leverage on our P&L quite substantially also in the quarter, so that\u2019s how -- that\u2019s the measure of success, in a way. \nGary P. Fayard: And I would add -- let me just add one thing to that -- as we continued to drive productivity in G&A, we continued very solid investment in the brands globally everywhere, so we are continuing with very solid investment on the brands and marketing. \nNeville Isdell: Let me just add to that as well in that when there are times of economic difficulty, it\u2019s the weaker competitors that tend to suffer more. That\u2019s why we are continuing with the investment. And just as we\u2019ve outlined that food service often is an indicator of what\u2019s happening in the broader economy, one of the early indicators of our ability to grow share is economic difficulty because other companies will pull back on their investment in marketing. The noise level broadly in the marketplace, not just with regard to non-alcoholic ready-to-drink, goes down and therefore the impact of our investments is greater. And we\u2019ve seen that over many cycles and we would anticipate that to be the case as we go ahead, so that is the mitigating factor for us as we meet the same headwinds that everyone else does and that is why we are maintaining that confidence behind our marketing programs and investing behind them. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Muhtar, trademark Coke, it\u2019s your largest trademark. If I have my facts right, it slowed appreciably in the quarter to up 2% after accelerating to up 4 in \u201907. I guess first, do I have the facts right and if I do, to what extent do you think that\u2019s purely a function of North America and to what extent are there other factors at work here?\nMuhtar Kent: No, I think actually we\u2019re pleased with the growth of our sparkling beverages overall, as well as trademark Coca-Cola. I think what you have to take into consideration is that now we are cycling an international that\u2019s up 4% and we are cycling now Coca-Cola Zero and in fact, despite cycling Coca-Cola Zero, we are still growing trademark Coca-Cola, which is really the litmus test for success for us. And you\u2019ve got two factors that happen in the quarter. One is that North America is down but also Africa, for specific reasons related to South Africa, which is a big trademark Coca-Cola market, was down as a result of the specific shortages for CO2 resulting from energy shortages in the country and we are taking mitigating action to correct that.  So we feel good about the results overall, both internationally and overall as a total global basis. \nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: And the interaction between Coke Zero and the other trademark Coke names continues to be as favorable as you have seen it in the past?\nMuhtar Kent: Positive and the same kind of dynamics in terms of incremental growth. \nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up to John Faucher\u2019s question about the bottling assets. In India, Neville, when you first came back to the company there was a lot of work that had to be done to fix that business and it seems like it is on the right track, at least volumetrically. So if you could talk a little bit about the profitability of the bottling operations in India now relative to where they were.  And then also, I understand you made a management change there during the first quarter, so if you could talk a little bit about the thinking behind that management change and what happens going forward there.\nNeville Isdell: Well, the Indian bottling operations were profitable in 2007. We see that profitability expanding in 2008. I\u2019ve just spend 12 days in India, actually, and I was out in a number of markets. Some of them are CBO markets and the quality of execution against what we had four years ago is actually chalk and cheese, which is what we are trying to do around the world.  We are still not there yet in India. There is still a great deal to be done. I think that\u2019s true of all of the CBOs. Again, I think that comes back to the question that we answered earlier on CBOs. We\u2019ve made an awful lot of progress. Generally profitability is improving. It is masked somewhat by the new acquisitions and the drag that they bring to it. You don\u2019t see it within that but if you look at the ones that we\u2019ve been working on for some time, every single one is reacting positively to the new management that we\u2019ve brought in four years ago in terms of Irial and the people that he\u2019s brought in. So we have a really strong professional team now that\u2019s doing an excellent job.  On the management change, Muhtar can comment on it as well but that essentially was just a normal cycling. We sent John [Ustavson] there on a specific period of time to really put an expert in to change many, many things in a short period of time. John\u2019s a very experienced executive. But that was the agreement with John. We have an Indian executive who\u2019s been trailing him who has now taken over, so we have local management.  And what happens with a turnaround, the first real big difficult piece is the first tranche. You need a really strong individual to do that. Then once it\u2019s in place, you can bring someone who sees the strategies are all there and can continue to do that, and I\u2019ve spent some time with him actually in India and we are confident we\u2019ve got very good Indian management leading that business.  Muhtar, I don\u2019t know if you want to add to that. \nMuhtar Kent: The only add-on would be that I am also very pleased to see in India that it\u2019s not just the CBOs, that the company-owned bottling operations that are performing but it\u2019s the franchise bottlers and their increasing appetite to continue to invest in the marketplace is driving results in every part of the country in all markets, so it\u2019s not just the CBOs that are performing but also the franchise business is performing very well and all the -- we have a much stronger brand portfolio in India. We\u2019ve launched organically some still beverages that we believe will do very well in the area of juice and juice containing beverages. We have a very good trademark in juice in Maaza as well as Minute Maid, so we think that India is on track but as Neville said, a long way to go before we can be pleased about -- it\u2019s still very low per capita when you think about it. So we\u2019ve got a long road ahead of us in terms of sustainable growth. \nNeville Isdell: I just want to build off Muhtar\u2019s comment because there is a very important piece here, and that is the new level of respect that the bottlers have for our ability to run bottlers and what that actually does in terms of the overall system. And I will give you some anecdotal stories but let me go back to India; four years ago, I met a very, very unhappy group of franchise bottlers. I was with all the franchise bottlers, as I say, a couple of weeks ago. I have never seen them more bullish. Muhtar has given you some facts around that.  We were with the Mexican bottlers a few weeks ago. I can tell you four years ago I had a very difficult meeting with the Mexican bottlers. We had a very good meeting with the Mexican bottlers and that -- I can tell you stories of those sort of pictures around the world, so -- it\u2019s A, what we are doing with the portfolio, what we are doing with the marketing, what we are doing on the franchise leadership side but also the confidence that we actually know what to do with regard to our bottling investments as well. I think there really is a positive synergy that comes out of this. \nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Ann Gurkin with Davenport.\nAnn Gurkin - Davenport & Co. Of Virginia: Good morning. As you look at many of your faster growing international markets, is there any reason right now to change your economic outlook for those markets? Any reason to suggest a slowdown? And then, is there any likelihood you\u2019ll use greater cash flow to buy back more than expected shares?\nMuhtar Kent: Let me take the first part, Ann, and then I\u2019ll hand it over to Gary on the share purchase. As far as -- we had again a very, very good quarter in terms of how we grew both in the BRIC markets with China leading the way, but also in Brazil, also in Russia, very good results in Russia, both in the sparkling category, trademark Coca-Cola and also in the still beverage category in Russia, in India, as we just talked about. But also in key emerging markets, such as Ukraine and such as Turkey and such as some other Asian markets. I mentioned Korea also, that we had some growth for the first time in many quarters.  So in general, we are very, very happy with the results and with the market conditions, with the investments, with the portfolio, with the alignment with our bottling partners and with the programs that we have in place for the balance of the year and going into the future.  In terms of economic contagion and what happens, we haven\u2019t seen any results right now. What will happen in terms of the impact of the food prices around the world, we\u2019ll have to wait and see. You know as well as I do that there\u2019s a lot of current dislocation in terms of the staple goods, wheat and rice and corn, and we\u2019ll see how all of that plays out. \nGary P. Fayard: Ann, as we go through that and because -- well, we are seeing obviously, IMF last Friday I believe revised downwards some GDP growth estimates in a lot of the markets. Our expectation is you will see some slowdown in GDP around the world but I think those countries we continue to believe will still remain healthy and continue to grow maybe a little slower.  But recognizing that fact, that\u2019s why we said at the beginning of the year that our share repurchase would actually be in the $1.5 billion to $2 billion range, because it is kind of uncertain economic times.  So each quarter we\u2019ll revise that number based on what we see. We\u2019re still at the 1.5 to 2, but obviously cash flow is coming in significantly ahead of what we would have expected even six weeks ago, just from the currency upside that we\u2019ve seen and we\u2019ll be revising that as we go through the year. \nMuhtar Kent: And just one last comment on the macroeconomic situation; based on my experience from past previous macroeconomic headwinds, what we do have a difference of this time is that across the world in terms of BRIC countries, in terms of the macroeconomic indicators of the emerging markets, the fiscal discipline and the monetary dynamics and ratios of all the economies have never been better. In other words, all the emerging market economies are going into this economic environment with actually better fiscal discipline in terms of budget deficits, inflation, et cetera, than they\u2019ve ever, ever faced such a situation in past years. So there is that piece to consider also. \nAnn Gurkin - Davenport & Co. Of Virginia: Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Anthony [Vocallo] with Credit Suisse.\nAnthony Vocallo - Credit Suisse: Good morning, everyone. On the expected currency benefit reinvestment, you touched on that in your press release and I think Gary touched on that in his comments. Are those plans in place? Are they being created now? And if so, how and where could we expect those to materialize for your company and for your -- \nNeville Isdell: Well, the headline is they are not in place yet. We are still working on them. Let me make -- let Muhtar make some additional comment. \nMuhtar Kent: I think the important thing is where we see opportunities, we will proactively make decisions to ensure that we continue to reinvest behind our brands for sustainable growth. That\u2019s the real bottom line that I\u2019d like to underline.  We don\u2019t have plans in place but we see this as an opportunity and therefore you will see us taking those opportunities where we see they will deliver long-term, continue to deliver long-term sustainable growth. Gary. \nGary P. Fayard: That\u2019s exactly what I would say. On every opportunity that we see, we are being very rigorous as we go through, looking at long-term returns, the things you would expect us to look at. We do have an opportunity but we are going to be very prudent and review everything -- is it a valid investment that we think we should make?\nNeville Isdell: I just want to keep emphasizing the word long-term that you hear because I\u2019m sure the fear might be that we take short-term actions because of the currency gains that we have, by just pricing actions, which are non-replicable as we go forward, and I just want to point out that that is what we are not going to do. You heard the words -- we\u2019ll only do it if it is expenditure that is going to benefit the long-term. \nAnthony Vocallo - Credit Suisse: So there\u2019s no specific broken bone that you are going to treat this year?\nMuhtar Kent: No, I mean, we\u2019ve addressed our issue markets rapidly in past periods and you won\u2019t see us doing that. I think the two areas that you will see us focusing on opportunities will be investing in certain programs that will give us sustainable growth, long-term sustainable growth and secondly also some productivity initiatives, behind some productivity initiatives that may require some investment up front. \nAnthony Vocallo - Credit Suisse: Great. Thank you very much. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Marion [Montagne] with [inaudible]. \nMarion Montagne: At the European Union, you seem to have some pretty good numbers versus year-ago, at least on the volume side. And as I look further down, I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s an area where you\u2019ve started to put it more into marketing. Could you give us a little more color around that area?\nMuhtar Kent: Yeah, what I\u2019d like to say is that as I mentioned, we\u2019ve cycled a very strong quarter from previous year and the good news is that all our major countries -- Great Britain and also France and Italy and Germany, Spain, they all grew in volume and we also gained both volume and value share across the categories in Europe.  I think that the key word here is that we have the foundation in place to continue to generate long-term growth. We are cycling many programs, particularly Coca-Cola Zero, very successful launches from previous year, and we\u2019ve got great programs ahead with the European Football Championship happening in two key locations in Central Europe this year, with most of the summer, particularly early summer will be soccer fever. And we\u2019ve got good programs across the Olympics and we feel that we can continue to generate long-term growth in this very key geography. \nMarion Montagne: Okay, since you threw out the word Olympics, can I ask is the marketing going to directed towards the -- what was it, a universal table kind of theme and then local theme? Is that how you are going to approach this?\nMuhtar Kent: It\u2019s going to be local from market to market, with customer -- specific customer related programs as well as brand related programs mainly across trademark Coca-Cola. \nMarion Montagne: Okay. Thank you. \nAnn Taylor: We have time for one last question. \nOperator: The last question will come from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Muhtar, on vitamin water, clearly as you\u2019ve noted here, it\u2019s outperforming your expectations. I was hoping we could get a little bit more update on where the -- from a North America perspective, where the ACV in convenience for vitamin water and smart water is versus the 50 and 15 you had at the start of the year.  And then also when you look at same-store sales growth for that particular brand or family of brands, in some of the older markets like New York and L.A., what are you seeing there versus some of the newer markets?\nMuhtar Kent: I think that we, as I said, we see some very robust consumer reaction to vitamin water. We\u2019ve got basically ACV up to now 98% in the supermarkets, up from about 90% in pre-acquisition. Both vitamin water and smart water increases in velocity. The hybrid distribution system is really working well and you\u2019ve seen us in the quarter almost doubling the business versus prior year and again, sourcing volume from across the board and generally creating a very good category platform for active lifestyle beverages, sourcing volume from the sports category, from energy and very, very powerful again in particularly the convenience channel, as well as the supermarket channel and also with some customer-specific distribution in some food service, selected food service customers as well as airlines, as well as almost now 40 extra campuses around the country, et cetera. \nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: And when you look at the more -- I wouldn\u2019t call them developed but some of the older markets like New York and L.A., how are they performing on a same-store sales basis?\nMuhtar Kent: Very good vertical growth continuing, organic vertical growth. \nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Excellent. Okay, thank you, Muhtar. \nNeville Isdell: Well, that being the last question, I just want to say thanks to Muhtar and Gary and also to each of you for joining us this morning. As you hear from our tonality and I guess even the tonality of your questions, we are off to a very good start in 2008. I know what you are focused on is is this going to continue through 2008 and we are actually confident that our strategies are working and as I mentioned earlier, that we expect 2008 to be another successful year for the Coca-Cola Company.  Just as a headline, we\u2019re going to just continue to leverage our leading brands, our global footprint, and also our strategic acquisitions to continue to drive growth and, most importantly, long-term value for our shareowners. Thank you very much indeed. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Coca-Cola Company\u2019s first quarter 2008 earnings results conference call.

Which reconciled certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to by our senior executive in our discussion this morning. And from time to time in discussing our financial performance to our results are reported under generally accepted accounting principles. Please look our website for this information. Now, let me turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Jackson and good morning everyone. Before I begin I\u2019d like to acknowledge the victims of the terrible tragedy in Haiti. The global Coca-Cola family continues to focus its efforts and resources in support of the millions of Haitians who are suffering following last months devastating earthquake. And I\u2019d like to urge everyone who\u2019s listening to this call to contribute to one of the many worthy organizations that are helping to provide relief in this time of great need. Now, let me begin by saying that I\u2019m very pleased to report that we ended 2009 with solid growth for both the quarter as well as the full year. We achieved this through strong system alignment. Guided by the shared values and strategies in our 2020 vision which is our roadmap for winning together with our bottling partners. As we enter a new decade, I\u2019m pleased to say that the foundation of our business, our wonderful dynamic brands, our strong financial position and our unmatched global footprint is stronger than ever. Our global share is growing. This is our tenth consecutive quarter of winning total non-alcoholic ready to drink volume and value share. At the same time we are generating consistently strong and steady cash flow. While investing in our business for the long term.  We\u2019re also thinking and acting like an integrated global enterprise while intensifying our local focus. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver consistent long term sustainable results as we usher in another exciting decade of growth for our Coca-Cola system.  This past quarter we delivered strong international unit case volume growth of 6%, cycling 6% growth from the prior year quarter. And total world wide unit case volume increased 5%, cycling 4%. I think it is important to remember that we achieved these results despite the ongoing impact of the global recession across many markets.  Strong economic headwinds are still impacting the broader consumer good sector, especially in the developed world. Key international markets are fueling significant volume growth for us. China was up 29% in the fourth quarter. The 26th consecutive quarter of double digit growth. For the full year 2009, China was up 16%. This has widened the share gap against our primary competitor in this key market. India was up 20% for the quarter and 31% for the full year. We\u2019ve captured volume and value share across both the sparkling and still categories for the quarter and the year.  And in Latin America, we delivered consistent growth across our entire portfolio, also gaining share in both the sparkling and stilled categories for the quarter, and also for the year. Brazil was up 8% for the quarter and 4% for 2009 full year. And Mexico was up 4% for the quarter and 6% for the full year. Just to put this in perspective, the 2009 incremental volume from China, India, Mexico and Brazil, four countries alone was equal to adding another Germany, our sixth largest market to our business. No question, absolute growth is vital. That said, we remain laser focused on delivering profitable growth. Today, we\u2019re pleased to report full year comparable currency neutral operating income growth of 7%. This is in line with our long term growth target which we have met or exceed for the fourth straight year. Equally important, we continue to implement three constant strategies with our bottling partners. The first is investing ahead of demand in the immerging markets. Secondly, maximizing capture of value in developing markets. And thirdly, driving profitable growth in developed markets. Along with our global bottling partners, we are winning together locally by effectively executing the strategies in order to best serve each markets unique consumer and customer needs. Our results are a testament to our seasoned system wide operating teams. But regardless of the market conditions, remain focused on engaging consumers, providing value for our customers and building our brands. We shared our 2020 vision with many of you during our investor and media event in Atlanta last November. Now, as we enter 2010 and embark on another era of growth for our Coca-Cola system, we remain very positive about the broader macro trends. We also remain firm in our belief that there is absolutely no better business than the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage business. Consumers all around the world enjoy our brands on average 86 times per year. What we refer to as our per capita consumption. Of course, there are many countries across each continent where per capita consumer is much higher. But we also have many other countries, like India, like China, Indonesia to name a few that are far below 86, and therefore offer us significant growth opportunities. And as our 2009 results attest, we believe that we are well positioned to continue capturing growth in these and all other markets. In the coming decade, as a billion new consumers enter into the middle class around the world we see great opportunity for our per capita to continue rising. So while we are selling moments of pleasure it says at time, 1.6 billion servings every day. We feel that there is tremendous opportunity both today as well as tomorrow. And we firmly believe that our great Coca-Cola system and our 700,000 associates, who refresh the world with our brand every single day, are ideally positioned to help us capture this opportunity and achieve and surpass the goals of our 2020 vision. Looking forward to 2010 and beyond, we remain intently focused on what critically matters to the long term growth and success of our business. Communicating with our consumers and investing in our brands. Let me just quickly walk through you both of these priorities. First, communicating with our consumers. We had wonderful platforms in place to expand our communication and connect with consumers all across the world. Our plans include engaging consumers in a way that only Coca-Cola can. Through our long standing partnerships with the world\u2019s most iconic global sporting events, both occurring this year. First, for the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games. We launched a 12 month brand activation plan in Canada. We also launched a widespread program across 11 countries, that include the Olympic torch relay, consumer as well as customer events. In addition, our Open the Games, digital experience has been fully activated in the United States as well as Canada and also in six European nations. In addition, we are executing our FIFA 2010 World Cup program. This global football event is the single largest sporting event in the world. It is watched in over 200 countries. Given that the 2010 World Cup will be held on the African continent for the very first time, we\u2019re likely to see a global television audience of well over one billion viewers for the final match alone. In other words, 10 times the size of the Super Bowl. So it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that our FIFA 2010 activation will be our most comprehensive campaign ever. It will include global commercials, online programs, commemorative packaging, and a 225 day World Cup trophy tour touching 86 countries. In addition to sports, we\u2019re also undertaking our most ambitious social media program ever. It is called Expedition 206. A team of three young happiness ambassadors traveling to the 206 countries where Coca-Cola is sold all to seek out what makes people happy. This exciting program engaged consumers both online and on the ground. Allowing fans to interact with and follow our teams real-time updates as they criss-cross the global. Let me share how this program is quickly becoming global phenomenon. In January the team spent most of their time making stops across Latin America. At the same time, the program generated nearly 400 million media imprints in China alone. And of course, our award winning Open Happiness global campaign continues to connect with more and more consumers around the globe. At the end of 2009 the campaign was running in markets representing approximately 95% of our global Coca-Cola volume. Our most recent Open Happiness television commercials were prominently displaced during this past Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl with MS-NBC naming our (inaudible) hard times commercial the game\u2019s number one spot and our Street Walker ranking in the top five on USA Today\u2019s add meter. The common thread in all of these initiatives is that they enable us to speak efficiently and effectively directly and passionately to consumers in every single nation. And they do so in a way that is uniquely Coca-Cola, inspiring moments of optimism and happiness. Now, for the second part, let me turn to investing in our brands. As in 2009, we will maintain a relentless focus on growing our sparkling portfolio and on expanding our stilled beverages faster. Momentum is on our side. While unit case volume for sparkling beverages grew 1% for the full year, in the fourth quarter of 2009 we saw 3% growth, with our sparkling international performance up 5%. Pacific increase sparkling beverages 9% for the quarter and 6% for the full year. Latin America grew sparkling beverages 5% for the quarter and 3% for full year. Eurasia and Africa, sparkling beverages gained 4% for the quarter and 3% for the full year. And while sparkling beverages in Europe were down 1% for the full year due to the difficult economic challenges faced throughout the region, they were actually up 1% for the quarter. Importantly, brand Coca-Cola grew 4% this past quarter, positive proof that our strategy, winning with Coca-Cola is leading the charge for us all around the world. And while sparkling beverages in North America declined 2% in the quarter as a result of continued macro economic pressures, this performance was a sequential improvement relative to the first nine months of the year. In fact, let me take a moment to reflect on our (inaudible) program in North America this past year. We made critical investments in our brand and provided greater consumer choice by developing innovative packaging and industry leading labeling practices. Our $0.99 cold contour bottle, two litter contour package and new sleek mini cans that make portion control easy, a great examples of how we provide consumers with affordable value and our system and customers with profitable growth. In addition, Coca-Cola Zero delivered double digit volume for the 15th consecutive quarter. At the same time, we expanded key initiatives and best practices to drive benefits across our North America system, including extending our incidence based pricing model to bottlers representing more than 90% of our sparkling volume. Further deployment of read or right execution daily and also continued progress with Coca-Cola supply on track to exceed our three year goal of $150 million in supply chain productivity. All of these are ample evidence that our North America system is operating from a position of increasing (inaudible).  Now, let me move to our still beverages, which are also experiencing tremendous momentum in the market place. Overall, our global still beverage portfolio grew 9% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year. This growth was consistent and widespread. Each of our five operating groups registered positive still beverage growth for the full year.  Latin America stilled beverages grew 24%, expanding a portfolio of well established and emerging brands. Both Pacific and Eurasia and Africa groups stilled beverages gained 8% and Europe stilled beverages increased 2%. And North America stilled beverages were up 1%, growing both volume and value share in this still category for the second consecutive year. In addition, simply, our premium North America juice brand joined the ranks of our billion dollar brand at retail becoming our 14th billion dollar brand. We see great opportunity in 2010 to grow still beverages faster by leveraging our unique geographic footprint. Let me just give you a couple of examples. Take vitamin water for example, by the end of 2009 vitamin water was in 60 international cities, adhering closely to our influence of model strategy of focusing on select premium outlets that build brand equity. We have captured over 20 miles of incremental shelf space in over 100,000 stores through these international expansion efforts. In 2010, we plan to expand into more influential cities abroad while strengthening and growing our presences in existing markets. Similarly, with Powerade, we will launch our first ever integrated campaign across our top 20 markets. These markets make up 95% of the brands body.  All of this will be done in conjunction with our FIFA World Cup activation program. And with Minute Maid, we are leveraging a common global identity system to drive marketing productivity in our leading juice brands while maintaining our local relevance. This also enables us to quickly expand successful brands across boarders, as in the case of Minute Maid Pulpy, which began in China and was launched in eleven markets by the end of 2009. We also introduced Minute Maid Pulpy in Mexico last month and plan to expand additional markets in Latin America as well as Africa in 2010. You will recall that we indicated to you at the start of last that 2009 was going to be challenging year for our business. And in fact, for all business. We also said that we might miss our long term growth targets in quarter or two over the course of the year. Yet, it is clear that 2009 was a very solid year for us. And we are very pleased with our results despite the challenging environment.  We stayed true to our word and remained confident that we will keep winning together with our great bottling partners in 2010.  That said, with consumers still challenged by a mixed global recovery, there again may be bumps along the way with some quarter to quarter volatility still possible as we move through 2010. However, we look forward to another exciting decade of growth for our Coca-Cola system.  Our 2020 vision is clear. Our strategies are sound. And system is well positioned. And we remain focused on meeting or exceeding our growth targets over the longer term while always driving sustainable shareholder value. With that, let me turn the call over to Gary.\nGary Fayard: Thanks, Muhtar. And good morning everyone. As Muhtar indicated in 2009 we continued to deliver consistent sustainable quality growth growing volume, share and comparable currency neutral revenue and profit. Importantly we delivered against our 2009 commitment, growing volume and profit inline with our long term targets on a full year basis. First, let me remind you that in the fourth quarter of 2009, we had six fewer selling days than in the same period in 2008. And I\u2019ll try to call out the impact of these days as I review our results for this past quarter. As outlined in our release, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.66, up 3% versus a prior year. Full year reported earnings per share were $293, up 18%. While comparable earnings per share were $3.06, down 3%, but reflecting a large negative currency impact. For the quarter, our business delivered 5% revenue growth, driven by a 1% increase in concentrate sales and a 5% positive currency impact. We estimate fourth quarter net revenues would have been inline with our long term targets if adjusted for the impact of the six fewer selling days.  And excluding structural changes, our comparable currency neutral net revenues increased 4% for the full year. For the quarter, comparable currency neutral operating income was flat, again, impacted by the six fewer selling days that I mentioned earlier. Adjusting for the impact we estimate the currency neutral income would have been ahead of our long term growth targets. For the full year comparable currency neutral operating income was up 7% inline with our long term currency neutral profit target. And in fact up 8% adjusting for structural change. SG&A expenses were up 9% in the quarter. And increased 2% on a currency neutral basis. So seven points of currency in that 9% increase. This increase was partially attributable to an increase in incentive costs as well as increase in pension costs due to a decline in the value of (inaudible) assets of 2008 and lower discount rates. And I do want to highlight our continued commitment to our brands. As I highlighted last quarter, we\u2019ve increased our spending our point of sale marketing and activation programs to engage and win with consumers within the four walls of our customer outlets. When taken in combination with our direct marketing expenses, we increased our overall marketing investments for the fourth quarter. And sustained them for the full year.  As I shared last quarter, we expected our operating expense leverage to be negative for the fourth quarter due to the six fewer selling days. Accordingly, our leverage for the fourth quarter was slightly negative offsetting the operating leverage benefit we recorded in the first quarter when we had five more days in the quarter. Importantly, on a currency neutral basis, our operating leverage for the full year was a positive three points in line with our expectations.  Our cash flow from operations increased 8% to $8.2 billion for the full year in spite of the currency headwinds reflecting the strength of our underlying business performance.  For the full year 2009, we repurchased approximately $1.5 billion in stock, which is more than the $1 billion that I indicated in our last call. Given the strong performance of our stock in 2009 we experienced greater activity in our stock option programs in the fourth quarter. And we ramped our repurchases in response to that activity. As for 2010, we expect to repurchase an additional $1.5 billion in stock over the course of the full year.  Lastly, let me touch on price mix. We achieved positive pricing for both the quarter and the full year. We\u2019re particularly pleased with this result as it was accomplished while implementing brand building affordability programs across many markets in response to the challenging consumer system.  As for geographic or country mix, as anticipated our emerging markets are recovering from the global recession at a quicker rate than our developed markets. Resulting in unfavorable geographic mix at a consolidated level. Therefore, in the fourth quarter of 2009 we saw price mix slightly down at minus 1%. Yet for the full year price mix was even. All while we grew volume and gained global volume and value share. These results reflect our continued efforts, focus and commitment to both play and win in every type of market as they come out of this global crisis. As for 2010, it would be reasonable to expect similar price mix results to 2009. As consumer sentiment continues to improve at varying rates across our geographic portfolio. And looking beyond 2010 we would expect to see positive price mix over the long term. Now, let me take a moment to provide an initial outlook on some of the other key factors that we see impacting 2010. Many of you are aware of the recent devaluation of the Venezuela Bolivar and the country\u2019s designation as a hyperinflationary country for accounting purposes. As a result, in the first quarter of this year we will incur a one time exchange loss from remeasurement of approximately $100 million, and that remeasurement of our net assets in Venezuela will be recorded below operating income. As for currencies overall, after considering current spot rates before what we\u2019re seeing happen to the dollar this morning, the anticipated benefits of our hedging coverage, the cycling of prior year exchange rates and the impact of the Venezuela devaluation on our local operations, we expect currencies to have a slightly positive impact on operating income for the full year 2010, with a benefit more heavily weighted in the first half of 2010. And you may have seen that the dollar started weakening again this morning. We will maintain our disciplined approach to SG&A in 2010. While we\u2019ll be cycling the initial benefits of our productivity initiatives, we expect to capture between one and two points of operating leverage in 2010 from our productivity programs. Importantly, we remain on track to deliver $500 million in annual savings from these productivity initiatives by year end 2011. From a capital expenditure standpoint, we expect to maintain our capital investment levels in line with the levels of the past several years. For 2010 our best estimate is that the full year underlying effective tax rate will be in the range of approximately 22%-23.5%.  And then two other modeling items. First I\u2019m happy to tell you we\u2019re not going to have a day swing of five and six days like we did in \u201909. But we will have a day swing of one day, the first quarter of 2010 will have one less day. The fourth quarter of 2010 will have one more day.  Lastly, let me take a moment to address some recent accounting rule changes. As required by the financial accounting standards board effective January 1 of this year, we are no longer consolidating certain entities primarily some bottling operations. And let me emphasize, this will not impact our consolidated net income, earnings per share. But it will impact our 2010 reported results when compared to our \u201909 results, especially within our bottling investments group. Specifically, and this for the full year 2009, the entities that were deconsolidated as the first part of this year accounting for 3% of our consolidated net revenues and 2% of our consolidated operating income. We\u2019ll let you know how the change impacts our comparable results during each quarter this year.  In closing, as I look back at 2009, it was a successful year. And I\u2019m very happy with our results. Despite challenging economic conditions, we delivered against our volume and profit growth targets. We strengthened our brands, our company and our global system. And thanks to the efforts of our experienced management team and our system bottling partners, we are much better positioned as we begin to emerge from these difficult economic times. So while we expect the economic environment to stay challenging in 2010, our success these past 12 months reaffirms our confidence that we will continue to gain global share, enhance the value of our brands and drive long terms profitable growth and value for our shareholders. Operator, we are ready for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. (Operator\u2019s instructions). Thank you. Our first question is from Marc Greenberg with Deutsche Bank. \nMarc Greenberg - Deutsche Bank: Thanks and good morning. Muhtar, using history as a guide, what kind of system boost do you think you might see both in local markets and overall as a consequence of World Cup and Olympics? And as for the media, how do you think the African consumers will appreciate the Simpson\u2019s ad?\nMuhtar Kent: I think it\u2019s fair to say that the World Cup property really does generate a tremendous amount of excitement across the world. Particularly in Europe and Latin America. But this time, of course, Africa is completely engulfed by it as well. And I think that it\u2019s unique that it is on the African Continent, special treat for South Africa, of course, but also for \u2013 and the most important thing also is that when it\u2019s played in Asia you have some issues with timing in terms of view ship. But this time Europe time zone and Africa is identical, pretty much.  So that additional benefit. I think the last time we had the World Cup we saw some very encouraging results in our business with both very small, medium and large customers across the whole word, particularly in Europe and Latin America. And this time I think certainly that we will see tremendous excitement in addition to those continents from also Africa.\nMarc Greenberg - Deutsche Bank: Great. If I can just follow up briefly. Gary, on the bottler investments, you saw some benefits from volume leverage and input cost deflation on the bottler group. If we take out a lot of the currency shifts, where do you think the underlying bottler investment margins are right now?\nGary Fayard: Well, one thing I\u2019d say about bottling investments is remember the hospital ward (ph) time (inaudible) and that the only reason those bottlers are in there is for some kind of issue that was with bottler when we took it over. I think (inaudible) has been very consistent that forget commodities, forget currency, forget everything else, that over time we\u2019re going to see continuing improvement in margins within the bottler investment group. And we\u2019re seeing those. We\u2019re seeing the quarter by quarter and year by year. And I think you\u2019ll continue to see those where we\u2019re now seeing some of those bottlers actually coming up to, kind of, world class types of margins. We\u2019ve still got margin issues in others. But they\u2019re improving over time. And so I\u2019d say we\u2019re very comfortable with where it is. And there still improving.\nMuhtar Kent: Just one thing to add on that remark is that, the way I look at all these bottlers that are being \u2013 currently where we have equity majority and most of the time and manage them, is I put them into three groups, really. I say, group one ready now, group two ready in one to two years and then group three ready in three years plus. And we have some in all three groups.\nMarc Greenberg - Deutsche Bank: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Pecoriello with Consumer Edge Research.\nBill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research: Gary, you talked about for 2010 price mix probably remaining flattish and one or two points of leverage from productivity programs. In 2009, you delivered three points of leverage you referring to on the full year. So when you consider media rates and spending plans for 2010 do you think you can maintain overall about three points of leverage to offset the continued price mix drag versus the long term growth? Thanks.\nGary Fayard: I think where we are is because we\u2019re cycling some of those productivity programs in 2009. That\u2019s why we\u2019re saying that our leverage from SG&A will probably be in the one to two points of leverage versus the three points that we got in 2010. But some of what Muhtar is talking about, the first ever integrated global campaign for Powerade, etcetera, we\u2019re going to be able to get a lot of leverage out of better integration across markets where we\u2019re getting a lot of productivity in our marketing as well as we continue to reinvest, but actually not have to spend a lot more money and getting the same kind of leverage from it. So it\u2019s a different way of saying we\u2019re getting \u2013 some leverage you won\u2019t see for some things we\u2019re doing. But in addition to that we\u2019ll get one to two points, we think, in 2010.\nMuhtar Kent: Bill, provide one other commentary on that. No question that as you go up the air get thinner. And we are cycling some pretty big numbers that we\u2019ve been able to achieve in productivity gains in 2009 and even 2008 we\u2019ve achieved significant. And we\u2019re ahead of the $500 million program at the end of 2009. Now, the $500 million that we had put out there does not include, of course, the marketing effectiveness. It does not include supply chain gains and so forth. Those come on top. But I think you will see us striving towards \u2013 exceeding the $500 million and the time frame for that as you know was 2009, 2010, 2011. But no questions, I think we are \u2013 you need to consider that we\u2019re also cycling some of those gains. Yeah.\nGary Fayard: And Bill, just one other little piece of granularity as we talk about leverage within SG&A and things. One of the things we talked about that really hit us kind of hard in 2009 was pension expense. And I think this would go for all companies, and it\u2019s really you measure that \u2013 actuaries measure it at the end of year and then you reflect that expense over the following year. So what we saw in \u201909 was a result of the pretty dismal performance of all investment types coming out of \u201908, that hit us over $100 million of additional expense in \u201909. And we still got the three points of leverage. I was actually hoping to see some more leverage coming out of those pension expense numbers going down. They\u2019re going to go down somewhat. But the offset to much better investment activity and the assets going up in value is that we\u2019re not an environment where interest rates \u2013 and this helps in some ways but it hurts in others. Interest rates are kind of at historical lows and so your discount rates are very, very low. And that offset the investment gains we had. So we\u2019re not seeing a swing in the pension expense that we had kind of hoped. And so that\u2019s kind of holding us to that one to two points as well.\nBill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research: Thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment Research.\nWendy Nicholson - Citi Investment Research: Hi, two questions. First the guidance for the buy-back. Given how much cash you\u2019re sitting on I\u2019m surprised the guidance isn\u2019t more than just a $1.5 billion. And then second, is stilled beverage in Latin America, I know it\u2019s still really relatively immature business. But how sustainable is the 20% plus type growth you\u2019re seeing there?\nMuhtar Kent: Wendy, just let me make some commentary and I\u2019ll Gary to comment also on the share buy-back. But first I want to just stress the importance and how pleased I am with the fact of our cash generation in our business. I mean, in an era and in a time period of the last 16 months when so many businesses, so many companies were in trouble and strapped because of lack of cash, we grew our cash by 8% in the year. And went over $8 billion for the first time. So that gives a tremendous, also, flexibility as we move forward into this year and beyond. And I\u2019ll ask Gary to comment on that as well as on the share buy-back. On the distilled beverages side, I\u2019ve always said the journey for still beverages in Latin America really began for us only, sort of, fully in 2009. We started in the middle of 2008 with the acquisition of (inaudible) and also Mate Alaha (ph) and the herbal beverage business in Brazil. And we\u2019re rolling out Kuat Divio (ph) now in almost 20 countries already that brand. And not just in Latin America, we\u2019ve also rolled it out in some other countries across the world. So we see that it\u2019s still a very small base. And again, the picture of success is for us to continue to grow both sparkling in Latin America as well as still and understanding that because still is coming from a much smaller base it\u2019ll grow faster. And Gary, you wanted to comment on the share buy-back.\nGary Fayard: Yeah, Wendy. On the share buy-back, here\u2019s where we are. There\u2019s a couple of aspects to it and you\u2019re right we are sitting on a lot of cash. And I\u2019m well aware of that. But number two, I think we\u2019re still being somewhat conservative in our views and how we\u2019re investing. The other major thing is that around credit rating, and you\u2019ve heard me talk about this in the past, around holding those system credit ratings. We will be meeting with a credit agencies, rating agencies next month. And as we do that I\u2019ll update you each quarter as to where we are on share repurchase. And it very well could change. And I\u2019ll update you on that as we go through the year. Much as it did, it changed in the fourth quarter. And we very quickly changed as I saw stock option exercises ramping up. We accelerated our share repurchase programs. So we\u2019re very prepared to do that. I can just, kind of, give you a view right now. But at the end of the first quarter we\u2019ll give you an update on where we are.\nMuhtar Kent: Wendy, let me just also make a broader commentary on the juice business at large. I think we made juice a very major priority two years ago. And it is really important to remind ourselves of that. In the past, sort of, seven, eight years, the Coca-Cola system has nearly tripled its volume and almost doubled its share of its juice business globally growing at a double digit taker (ph). And we see still ahead tremendous opportunity. A tremendous opportunity in brands like Minute Maid, Cappy, Maaza the Kuat Divio malted made investments.  We continue to invest simply. And now I mentioned that it\u2019s now 14th billion dollar brand. And in Q4 of 2009 we announced the launch of our first global common look and feel for our leading juice brands beginning with Minute Maid in the USA as the first step in the strategy to create a single global juice brand architecture which unites different brand names under common logos. And I think you need to see that our partnerships with leading global juice experts like Cotrala (ph) are (inaudible) our investments, our partner\u2019s commitment, the system commitment all will continue to drive juice as a major opportunity in the coming years.\nWendy Nicholson - Citi Investment Research: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from John Faucher with JP Morgan.\nJohn Faucher \u2013 JP Morgan: Good morning, thank you. So, want to ask a couple of questions about Pacific, sort of following up on the results this quarter. First off, the China results were tremendous given the very difficult comparison. And obviously you\u2019re benefiting from some new product launches there. So can you talk about how we should view, sort of, the longer term run rate in China? Does your success over the last 12-16 months give you confidence that you maybe can even grow faster than you though maybe a year and a half, two years ago? And then secondly moving over to Japan, you\u2019ve talked a lot about the marketing changes that you\u2019re making to try and get the business moving.  Realizing there\u2019s a lot of category issues. But can you talk about potentially what we might need to think of from a restructuring standpoint in terms of the bottling system? Can west Japan work to consolidate the system more aggressively? How involved do you guys need to be in maybe changing the system over there? Thanks.\nMuhtar Kent: First China, again, you go up, oxygen gets thinner. We\u2019ve been growing double digits for the past 26 consecutive quarters. 26 quarters ago the base was significantly smaller, almost half of what the base is today. So, I want to first draw your attention to that. And I want to go back to the whole notion of investing ahead of the curve. I was in China in 2008, at the opening of our Shanghai global innovation center there in Shanghai and announced a $3 billion investment program in China. We\u2019re aggressively investing with our bottling partners, creating horizontal growth, creating vertical growth and expanding our outlet coverage and out with investments in China. You\u2019ve heard us talk about 6 million customers in China. Of the 6 million customers we\u2019ve still got a huge way to go in order to cover all of them properly in the way that we would say is best practice and the right execution daily. So we continue to invest in people, train people, thousands and thousands of people every year in our Coca-Cola University China. Investing in equipment, investing in distributing, investing in production.  We just opened a state of the art last year still beverage plant in China. I was there last year opening two new plants, one in the west and one in central China, inaugurating plants. So we continue to invest in China, invest in the consumer.  The Olympic Games really helped our brand. Us being the only sponsor of Shanghai Expo as an international company is again going to provide great returns for us.  But I think over time \u2013 and we are now building scale, we\u2019re building relevance with our portfolio, with our brands. Our brands are getting stronger. And I think this past quarter was the first time we\u2019ve widen the gap to more than two to one versus our principle international competitor. I think we\u2019re just getting started in China. The per capita's are still so low in China we\u2019re just getting started.  But again, it takes a lot of investment, a lot of effort to generate a quarter of a billion cases of incremental growth a year in China. I think we\u2019re the only ones who can really realize that kind of growth. And you will see us continue to focus on generating annual double digit growth rates in China. I think that\u2019s the picture of success, annual double digit growth rates. As far as Japan is concerned, John. Japan is a very challenging environment. I am pleased with the results in the last quarter in Japan where we continued to gain and drive share gains. But I think looking ahead, it\u2019s really important to understand that we are in the midst of extracting more saving from our system in China so we can continue to increase our investment in our brands. That is the picture of success. It\u2019s more about what we can, how quickly we can do. In Canto (ph) we now manage two of the four bottlers in Canto where we have equity positions in those. And I think you will see us being very active in that area in structural changes going forward.\nJohn Faucher \u2013 JP Morgan: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS. \nKaumil Gajrawala \u2013 UBS: Two questions, the first on margins. These countries that you identify with the low per capita consumptions, to the extent that you can, can you give us some help on what the profit dynamics looks like in those countries versus your global average? And then second, the lack of operating leverage between volume growth and profits, is that entirely due to the fewer selling days or is there anything else in there?\nMuhtar Kent: Yeah. I\u2019ll have Gary talk about the profits. And what were the first \u2013 I didn\u2019t catch your first question, Kaumil. The profit \u2013\nKaumil Gajrawala \u2013 UBS: The difference in the profit dynamics in the low per cap countries versus the more developed markets?\nGary Fayard: Kaumil, I\u2019ll go in reverse order. But the leverage in the fourth quarter has a negative expense leverage in the fourth quarter it\u2019s exactly what we expected, exactly what I referenced in the third quarter call. And it was entirely due to the six fewer selling days. Since we have a 100% of the expenses but not as many revenues because of the six fewer days. It\u2019s entirely due to that. And so you come back to, how was it for the full year. And it\u2019s three points of operating leverage. And again, we\u2019d expect operating leverage going forward into 2010.  Relative to margins in the emerging markets versus the total KO average, I\u2019m going to give you a couple of different views on that. Number one, our view of the world is that \u2013 and you\u2019ve heard this from us as we took you through our 2020 vision. Our view of the world is we\u2019re going to grow volume and we\u2019re going to grow share in every market in the world of which \u2013 where there is value. And so we\u2019re going to grow as fast as we can grow in every market.  What that means is, is particularly in environment where we are today where a lot of the emerging market countries are actually recovering faster than the developed markets is giving us negative geographic mix. But the point being, we\u2019re playing to win and we\u2019re playing to win in every market. So we\u2019re continuing to drive those.  Now, within \u2013 let\u2019s take some of those emerging markets. Take, China, take India, etcetera, what you see is margins that are much lower than company average. But I would go back to, and I think we probably talked in the past about this, if you go back 15-20 years ago and look at Mexico, you\u2019d see the same thing. At the time Mexico was delivering a lot of volume, but the margins were much lower.  What you have to do is build out as Muhtar was talking about. As we build out both vertically and horizontally in those markets, there is a point, and this is one of the keys to our business model, there is a point where you gain that critical mass of infrastructure. And when that happens your margins then actually start really increasing significantly faster than your volume or revenue growth. And it\u2019s because of lower marginal spend against every incremental case, if you will, because you\u2019ve built out that critical mass. So, we will continue to build out and growth the emerging markets. As we approach the critical mass you\u2019ll start seeing the margins improve and coming back towards the company average. But today, yes, they are less than the company average. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019d expect. That\u2019s why we would expect to see even in 2010 probably some continuing pressure on total price mix, but just being very specific. We had positive pricing in every geographic group for the full year 2009. It was geographic mix that was a negative. We expected it, we want it because we want to grow every market which we operate so we're very happy with it. We expect it could happen again in 2010. Overall we'll be fine, and long term we'll definitely come back to a more balanced \u2013 particularly as the rest of the world starts emerging from this economic environment in which we operate today. Just one other commentary on that. You've heard me often say that when a country reaches around 100 per capita something pretty incredible happens in that the pace of growth of bottom line significantly exceeds the pace of growth of revenue \u2013 of volume and revenue. And I think that is the case. It doesn't only start exactly at 100 per capita \u2013 it begins to show it's positive face, you know even at lower per capita's.\nMuhtar Kent: And one other just reference point would maybe be interesting. If you look maybe 10 years ago, and you look at Japan's profit base for us in the world \u2013 10 years ago as a percent of total was more \u2013 above the 20's. In fact sort of mid-20's. And over the last 10 years we've grown the base significantly \u2013 of our Japan profit base. But now as a result of what's happened in the rest of the world, it's only mid-teens. And not because Japan isn't growing, it has grown. It's because of what's happening in the rest of the world. Just as a reference point.\nKaumil Gajrawala - UBS Warburg: Got it, thank you.\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question is from Christine Farkas with Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nChristine Farkas - Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  Thank you very much. My Asian questions have been answered but I do want to follow up on some comments about marketing spend. Gary, you indicated a step up in marketing in the fourth quarter. I'm curious how much of this is ahead of the Olympics and World Cup and will we see easier comps when we cycle back going into 2011? Thank you. \nGary Fayard:  Thanks Christine. What we saw is we saw our business start improving in the fourth quarter obviously with the 5% volume growth well ahead of all of your expectations, I think. And as part of that we saw that we could start improving our marketing and lifting it up and increase the spend in the fourth quarter. Now \u2013 and remember the way we do marketing normally it's all on a curve, so it's spread across the full year, but when you get to the fourth quarter you catch it all up and we started spending more and it all caught up in the fourth quarter.  So that will give us some easier comp in the fourth quarter of next year. But really it was not so much directly to the Olympics and see for World Cup in the fourth quarter, particularly Olympics because we had those already planned and were implementing those programs as planned. So this was just \u2013 we saw the opportunity to increase, we did increase somewhat from where we had been full year as we saw our business actually doing very well in the fourth quarter.  \nChristine Farkas - Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  Okay, that's helpful, thank you.  \nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question is from Carlos Laboy from Credit Suisse. \nCarlos Laboy - Credit Suisse: Good morning, everyone. Two questions, one for Gary, one for Muhtar. Gary, you've accumulated some great returns on some of these minority equity investments you've made in bottlers over the last twenty years, and those minority investments were made when the bottlers had issues. So is the reason for making those equity investments as stated do you see an opportunity to sell down some of those positions and to reallocate that capital to new opportunities? Can you give us some guiding principles on how you think about unloading minority equity investments?\nGary Fayard: Yeah, Carlos. Thanks for the question actually. When you're talking about the equity investees I assume you're talking about the ones that we own more than 20% of but not the VIG consolidated investments. I just want to confirm so I'm answering the right questions\nCarlos Laboy - Credit Suisse:  Correct, the equity investment in bottlers that are independent.\nGary Fayard:  Yeah, and what I would say there is we have made those investments and have in fact realized some very nice returns on them. It's actually \u2013 you have to look at each one individually to understand exactly what our investment percentage should be. I would say that in all of those we would want the minimum to always be 20%, the maximum in the 40's somewhere. But each one is different and it kind of depends on the ones you're talking about. So I can't give you a hard and fast rule on any of them but we do evaluate them every year as we go through our strategic plans every summer, and are looking at all of them. But there is no hard and fast rule.   So I \u2013 without naming names, I can give you an example. One of our equity investees, because we and another shareholder together jointly control the bottler, we would not want to reduce our investment because as a group we'd probably lose control. So that one's kind of where it needs to be. So there are different reasons for different investment levels, but we're constantly looking at those to the extent \u2013 circumstances changed and we no longer needed an investment at the level we were, we will definitely look at that and might reduce them in fact, but we'd reduce them in an orderly fashion so we would not create any issues for the holders overhangs on the stock and that kind of thing. But as of today there are no plans to reduce any of those. \nCarlos Laboy - Credit Suisse:  Great, thank you. And Muhtar, could you comment briefly \u2013 expand briefly on the Philippines? You know, what bucket do you see it in? Is it in the ready now, or ready in one or two years, or is it ready in the three years plus time frame? \nMuhtar Kent:  Yeah, Carlos. I'm not going to \u2013 well firstly from the bin side it's a good quarter \u2013 and our investments and the leadership from our bossing investment group is beginning to show and the Philippines was one of those markets actually that was very negatively impacted as an emerging market from the macroeconomic environment, but I think we are hopeful as we move forward that we will continue to see positive results from our business in the Philippines. However, I'm not going to give you which bucket it's in. You know from what I'm saying that we're still in the midst of restructuring roster market, in the midst of restructuring production alignment across the whole country, across the islands, so we have some more work to do in the Philippines before we can say we are where we need to be. \nCarlos Laboy - Credit Suisse:  That's helpful, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today is from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Thank you, and good morning. Hey Muhtar, just a couple of questions on Europe here. First, you know \u2013 among the developed markets you're looking at pretty nice improvement in markets like Germany and France, so I'm just wondering if you could give us some perspective on what's driving the improvement in those markets? And then with what's going on in Greece, do you see any risks that the issues there and some of the regions around it could impact consumer demand in Europe broadly? And then I have a question on currency for Gary.\nMuhtar Kent: Yeah, Judy, I think as far as Europe is concerned, I think we have seen some good results in our business in 2009 in Western Europe. In fact, France was one of the top 10 contributors of volume overall in 2009 for the full year. So I'm very pleased with the growth rates in France and in Italy, in Germany in the quarter, in Britain. But I think Europe \u2013 Eastern Europe is much more trouble than Western Europe. It's an anomaly to think in that respect but it is. Southeast Europe, Romania, Bulgaria, Former Yugoslavia, countries of Former Yugoslavia as well as Russia, Ukraine.  Trouble in terms of what the consumer mindset is. But I think overall our marketing \u2013 our brand strength, our marketing, our investments our alignments with both Coca-Cola Enterprises as well as Coca-Cola Hellenic has proven results in some of those markets in Western Europe like Italy, like France and I think we continue to invest heavily in our brand, we continue to see opportunities for growth. And as far as issues in terms of what's going on in Greece \u2013 I think the international community will come to terms and I think we're close to seeing some finalization on what will happen in terms of the current financial situation in Greece. \nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs:  Okay. And then Gary, just in terms of currency clarification. You talked about the 2010, a slight benefit in terms of the FX impact. You know, historically you've talked about the practice of hedging on the hard currencies, so can you clarify that at this point you're protected in terms of the downside risks of the Euros and really whatever you get on the upside with respect to the Euro strengthening against the dollar that will flow through in terms of the EPS impact? \nGary Fayard: Yeah, Judy, thanks. In fact we continue to hedge. Our normal hedging programs are in place. We do use an option strategy such that we are protected against the downside. And we maintain and keep all the upside. So Euro for example as it really weakened over the last couple weeks due to just kind of risk aversion, we actually went into and are using our hedge coverage. So we're covered, we were using hedge coverage yesterday when the Euro was down at 135, 136 we're seeing it start to strengthen again some today. So yes, we've got the upside on the Euro, I think we'll wait and see.  I think the markets are probably \u2013 and this is going to be a currency forecast and you know what those are worth, but the markets are probably \u2013 have overreacted a little to risk aversion, have probably gone into the dollar and strengthened the dollar a little more than it should have. I think that will work itself out over the coming weeks. Probably four, six weeks, eight weeks whatever particularly with IMF it looks like going in to help Greece today, that's going to help significantly I think. So I think we'll see the dollar continue long term to weaken but there will be these risk aversion spikes, but as that happens we continue to put coverage in place to cover ourself against that. \nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay, thank you.\nGary Fayard: Thanks Judy. \nOperator:  Thank you. This concludes our question and answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Kent. \nMuhtar Kent:  Thank you Gary and Jackson. Before we conclude this call it's my pleasure to remind all of you that Patcho (ph) Reyes, the President of our Latin American group is going to speak at next week's Cagney event. He will provide a great overview of our Latin American business where we are realizing strong success. Our achievements in Latin America serve all of us as a wonderful example of long term growth opportunities that exist for the Coca-Cola company and Coca-Cola systems around the world. And in closing we feel very good about our company today and where we are headed tomorrow. We see great opportunity ahead in all of our global markets and remain intently focused on executing out key strategic priorities. All the while generating long term profitable growth for our system and sustainable rewards for our shareholders. Thank you for joining us this morning.  \nOperator:  Thank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

(Operator Instructions) Now I would like to introduce Mr. Jackson Kelly, Vice President and Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Kelly, you may begin.\nJackson Kelly: Good morning and thank you for being with us today. I'm joined by Muhtar Kent, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Fayard, our Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for questions. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report. In addition, I would also like to note that we have posted schedules on our company website at www.thecoca-colacompany.com under the Reports and Financial Information tab in the Investor section, which reconciles certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to by our senior executives in our discussion this morning and from time to time in discussing our financial performance to our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Please look on the website for this information. Now, let me turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that the fundamentals of our business remain strong. We continue to both grow and invest in our business, while generating a strong and steady cash flow. We've built a solid foundation, allowing us to focus on executing a consistent set of strategic priorities with our bottling partners and we are continuing to deliver consistent sustainable growth. During the third quarter, key international markets delivered significant volume growth with China up 15%, India up 37%, Mexico up 9, and Brazil up 3 yielding strong total international unit case volume growth of 4%, cycling 7% growth in the prior year quarter. Total worldwide unit case volume increased 2%, cycling 5%, despite the continued effects of the global recession across several key geographies including North America, Europe, Japan and Russia. In these and other markets, strong macro economic headwinds continue to impact consumer spending, and therefore the entire consumer goods sector. Despite this, we consistently delivered quality results above and below the line. On a comparable currency neutral basis, net revenues excluding structural changes have increased 3% for this quarter and 5% year-to-date. Operating income has increased 9% for both the quarter as well as year-to-date. As a result, despite the challenging economic environment I am pleased to say that we have achieved our revenue and profit targets for the first nine months of the year and we remain committed to our long-term growth model going forward. We know that during difficult economic times, consumers gravitate toward and reward the brands they know, the brands they love and trust. That is why we were pleased to see Coca-Cola once again recognized as the world's number one brand in the last BusinessWeek/Interbrand list of best global brands. Our brand value increased at that time when the overall value of the top 100 brands declined for the first time in this studies history. Further, we recently received our first ever Emmy award for the Coca-Cola Open Happiness Heist television commercial. Year-to-date, we have now launched our Open Happiness campaign successfully in markets representing over 80% of Coca-Cola volume with encouraging results. Cultivating love for our brand is translating into winning in the marketplace with brand Coca-Cola growing 2% total volume for the quarter. In fact, we continue to outperform the industry across many of our key categories and geographies. We once again grew total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink volume and value share making this the ninth consecutive quarter of winning global share. Further, we continue to drive solid volume growth with our Top 10 global retail customers without sacrificing value share in the process. This is the result of strong customer service, value creating programs and execution of market-specific brand pack and pricing architectures all around the world. It is clear that global economic challenges have impacted people in every market around the world. As I have said before, no single consumer has been immune to these challenges as we anticipate these economic pressures will continue to weigh on consumers through 2010. However, it is also just as clear that our companies focus on a consistent set of strategic initiatives is proving successful. We are operating with realism about current challenges but remain excited about our global opportunities ahead of us. In the short term, not unlike the rest of the industry, we remain challenged by the timing of the consumer recovery across markets, but we also see a growing opportunity to leverage the strength of our brands as well as our geographic footprint to drive share gains and position our system for profitable sustainable growth. In the long-term, we remain very positive about the broader global macro trends and can say with confidence that there is no better growth business to be in than the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink business. Our seasoned leadership team and our strong bottling partners are focused on investing together for growth to achieve our 20/20 vision. You have heard me speak about our 20/20 vision in previous communications. We will continue to expand upon it throughout this year, including at our upcoming investor and analysts event in Atlanta, which we all look forward to. We are focused on executing against three consistent strategies. First, driving global beverage leadership; second, leveraging our balanced geographic footprint, and strengthening system capability. Let me go into more detail on each of these strategies and how they continue to support our growth and solid results this quarter. First, driving global beverage leadership. Our business starts with growing sparkling beverages particularly trademark Coca-Cola. Every one of our key markets has Coca-Cola recruitment strategies in their plans. While I previously mentioned that brand Coca-Cola grew total volume 2% for the quarter, Coca-Cola Zero grew 7% in the quarter and 10% year-to-date while Trademark Sprite was up 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date. Further, we are continuing to drive global beverage growth in our 120 countries with per capita consumption of less than 150. For the third quarter in these countries, we grew total beverage volume by 6% cycling 10%, and sparkling beverage volume by 4% cycling 8%. We are also focused on faster still beverage expansion, with our still beverage unit case volume increasing 7% in the quarter driven by the organic growth of our megabrands and continued expansion of our recent strategic acquisitions. Internationally, still beverages are up 10%, led by 21% growth in Latin America, driven by our expansion of our Jugos del Valle business across the entire region. We have also expanded the footprint of our glac\u00e9au vitaminwater brand, which is now live across 50 influencer cities in a total of 12 international markets. Overall our total global still beverage portfolio gained volume and value share driven by our strong share performance in global juice, tea, sports drinks, enhanced water and energy brands. These were complimented by the successful launch of several new products. For example, we just launched our Minute Maid Pulpy dairy drink in China, a mixture of fruit juice, milk and coconut bits that will be sold across the entire country by the end of this year. So these are just a few of the many ways that we are meeting our consumers evolving needs through new, innovative and differentiated brands. Our global beverage leadership effort is supported by our world class innovation and marketing programs enabling us to build real brand value and win at the point of sale with our consumers. From an innovation perspective our Coca-Cola design progress was featured in the October issue of FastCompany magazine as part of their Masters of Design recognition program. We will highlight more of our latest innovations at our upcoming investor and analysts events in Atlanta. I also want to call out a few examples of how we are creating value through our marketing programs and proprietary global partnerships. First, we are leveraging existing global partnerships to connect directly with our consumers. For example we have just launched our FIFA activation program, including a 225 day, 86 country FIFA World Cup Trophy tour. Simultaneously we are well into our preparations for the in upcoming Winter Olympics in Vancouver including the launch of our Olympic Torch Relay event. Second, we are expanding our strategic sponsorship and marketing alliances as in the case of our recently announced agreement with Live Nation. Coca-Cola has a long history of connecting with consumers through their passion for music. So it makes perfect sense for Live Nation the world\u2019s largest concert promoter and Coca-Cola to team up and Open Happiness across Live Nation venues. Third, shifts in our marketing and media spend strategies are enabling us to communicate effectively and stay even more relevant with today's consumers. Specifically we are increasingly spending more in point-of-sale marketing and activation programs. For example, in Europe, we have shifted more marketing dollars toward in-store activation, and improving shelf impact by our on pack and point-of-sale promotions and shopper marketing activities like loyalty point programs, sampling and gifts with purchases. Further, in North America, we have increased our overall in-store direct investments. In addition, we have co-invested with our bottlers to accelerate our ability to offer consumers affordable value, and inspiring new products and packages that meet their needs while creating value for our system, and for our customers. We believe these strategies represent value creating ways to engage and win consumers within the four walls of the customer outlets. Importantly we have sustained our overall direct marketing spend in 2009, while also increasing our overall marketing effectiveness. We can confidently state that we continue to invest heavily in building our brands with consumers. Now, let me turn to our second strategy that is driving our growth, leveraging our balanced geographic footprint. As I shared with many of you earlier this year at (inaudible), we view our global markets falling into one of three growth segments; emerging, developing, and developed. We are actively managing our strategies to effectively grow our markets across each and all of these segments. In emerging markets our strategic focus is on driving consumption. As such our strategies are primarily focused on maximizing volume and investing in infrastructure. Some of these markets have been more insulated from the global recession than others, while some are experiencing a more volatile recovery. Accordingly, our quarterly results mirror these different paths to recovery. One emerging market that continues to accelerate rapidly for us is India, which saw us outstanding 37% growth, gaining volume and value share across all categories, in which we sell our brands. Another emerging market, China was up a solid 15% for the quarter, driven by our continued direct investments in the country, a strong push behind sparkling beverages and a simultaneous building of scale for still beverages. In fact, our overall portfolio in China has achieved solid double-digit growth for the last 25 consecutive quarters. We are consistently growing faster than our nearest global competitor and we are now more than twice their size and volume. We are the clear sparkling category leader in China. In still beverages in China, we have now obtained leadership in the juice and juice drinks category and our overall still portfolio is seven times the size of our nearest global competitor. One emerging market where consumers continue to be challenged by a weak economy is Russia. However, we have continued to win absolute share. We remain positive about the long-term growth opportunities for us in this critical market and will continue to invest for long-term growth. Turning now to developing markets, this segment represents important value growth opportunities for our company. As such our focus is on maximizing value, and building consumer loyalty. We continue to see the benefits of the strategy across many key developing markets, particularly in Latin America up 7% this quarter. Mexico, as I said was up 9%, led by an 8% increase for brand Coca-Cola. Argentina and Brazil both grew 3% and Chile grew 2%. Similarly other developing markets are also growing, including Thailand up 5% in the quarter and 7% year-to-date, and Vietnam up 12% in the quarter and 11% year-to-date. Finally, let me turn to more developed markets, such as Japan, Europe, and North America. Here consumers are experiencing a reset in terms of how they view the marketplace. We believe it is going to take a while for the consumers psyche to settle to a new normal. In these markets, we are focused on sustaining our brands as the most relevant and valuable proposition for consumers. And while absolute performance in these markets remains challenging, we continue to capture real value and volume share gains. First in Japan, this quarter\u2019s performance was impacted by the severe economic challenges, as well as, unfavorable weather. That said we still are outperformed the industry gaining share in both the important supermarket and convenience channel and making this the sixth consecutive quarter of share gain for our business in Japan. While the vending channel remains the challenge, we have successfully executed marketing programs and segmented strategies, driving consumer enjoyment of our beverages. As a result, we were pleased to see growth restored to our Georgia coffee brand this quarter, driven by both new flavors in the low calorie segment and our successful new \u201cWelcome to Georgia\u201d campaign. Second, our Europe volume remained soft in the quarter, driven by weak economic conditions across the region, while cycling 3% prior year growth. Despite these headwinds, we see growth reemerging in several key European marketplaces, including Belgium, Netherlands, France and Italy, all up low to mid single-digit and Germany up 1%. In total, we gained market share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in all key markets. This is notable considering the strong competitive pressure from B brands and private label brands in Europe and demonstrates the resiliency and value proposition of our powerful brands. Finally, as expected North America volume was impacted by the shift of the July 4th holiday into the second quarter, as well as, by deep competitive still beverage discounting in the back half of the quarter. While total North American beverage industry performance remained soft this quarter, we outperformed the industry on value share, while holding volume share on a year-to-date basis. Let me take a moment to remind you of how we continue taking action to restore growth in North America. Our North America sparkling business is focused on reminding consumers why they love our brands and providing them with the right size to enjoy our brands in new and relevant ways. Last quarter I -- last quarter I highlighted how our $0.99 cold contour bottle is providing consumers with affordable value and our system and customers with profitable growth. A couple of more examples today include the expansion of our two liter contour bottle, which today represents almost 40% of our US two liter volume, as well as, the recent introduction of our new 90-calorie sleek mini can, that provides consumers another great choice. These actions are representative of our on going efforts to correct the brand-price-pack architecture in North America, to drive results today and sustainable growth for the long-term. As for Coca-Cola Zero it continues to deliver registering double-digit volume growth for the 14th consecutive quarter. In still beverages our portfolio grew volume share for the ninth consecutive quarter and value share for the fourth consecutive quarter. An example of how we continue to win across our North America -- North American still beverage portfolio is the growth of our Simply brand, which we believe is on the path to becoming our next billion dollar brand. We have recently expanded our offerings to include chilled single-service packages, which now account for four of the top five fastest selling single-serve juice offerings in both supermarkets as well as convenience retail as measured by Nielsen. Lastly, we've made excellent progress as a system this past two years not just in addressing our brand portfolio but also our system economic model, alternative routes to market and customer governance. On this last topic of customer governance, bottlers representing over 99% of U.S. volume have just signed a customer governance agreement for joint business planning and execution with large retail customers. This demonstrates how we are working with our system to create healthy value-creating relationships with our customers. One theme, company and bottler. One face, one unified value story. Finally, let me address how we continue to strengthen our total system capability. Our strong cash flow and profitability continue to enable us to make strategic investments in our business with significant long-term return potential. This past quarter I've had the opportunity to travel across many of our key markets and visit with our bottling system partners as we jointly explore real investment opportunities for long-term sustainable growth. These include China, where we are investing $2 billion over the next three years. Just last week we announced the opening of a new $88 million still beverages plant in Wuhan in the heart of China to meet growing consumer demand. Mexico, where we opened a new state-of-the-art Jugos del Valle plant and recently announced our plan for our system to invest $5 billion over the next five years, primarily in infrastructure technology, equipment, environmental initiatives, marketing and training. In Russia, where our system has invested $2 billion since the early 1990s and where we are planning to invest another $1 billion in the next three to five years. And, finally, Vietnam, where our system has invested more than $200 million since 1994, last month in conjunction with our bottling partner we committed to invest an additional $200 million over the next three years. Further, we continue to invest in sustainable innovations like our new plant bottle, the first bio-based beverage bottle that can be recycled along with other PC bottles. Made with up to 30% plant-based materials, plant bottle is rolling out with Coca-Cola products in Denmark and with Dasani in selected areas of the US in the fourth quarter of 2009. This investment represents the kind of innovation that is critical for our continued success in the next decade and beyond. Finally, our global productivity initiatives are well on track to achieve our $500 million target by the end of 2011, and we will deliver more than half of the promised savings by the end of this year. To recap, I am pleased with the results we've delivered year-to-date. Our global system is better than ever and was built to grow and win in all environments. Our business fundamentals are strong. We are an attractive cash generator with a commitment towards investing diligently for the future. We are positive on both the short and long-term outlook for our business and strongly believe there is no better business to be in. We believe we have the right strategies and initiatives in place to drive long-term growth. Importantly, we recognize the need to actively execute these strategies in a tailored way to effectively build our brands and grow volume and value share across all types of marketplaces. While we may continue to experience some quarter-to-quarter volatility during these difficult economic times, our focus remains on the long-term opportunities before us. We have the unprecedented reach, scale, and brands to capture this opportunity and we are well-positioned to effectively manage our business for growth both in today's economic environment and as we look towards our future. With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary.\nGary Fayard: Thanks, Muhtar and good morning. As Muhtar indicated, we are continuing to deliver consistent sustainable quality growth, growing volume, currency neutral revenue, profits and share. I am pleased with our performance and our seasoned management team's ability to continue to navigate these challenging economic times. Because of their collective efforts, we remain on track to deliver against our commitment growing profits above our long-term target for both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. As outlined in our release, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.82 for the third quarter of 2009. If we exclude the impact from reducing our underlying effective tax rate on operations for the full year, which we now estimate to be approximately 23%, earnings per share would be $0.81. For the quarter, our business delivered sound and balanced 3% currency neutral revenue growth driven by 2% increase in concentrate sales and a 1% favorable impact from price and mix. On the year-to-date basis, our currency neutral revenue growth excluding bottler divestments stands at 5% in line with our long-term growth. For the quarter, reported operating income declined 2%, impacted by an 11% currency headwind. Comparable currency neutral operating income for the quarter increased a strong 9%, exceeding our long-term currency neutral profit target. And on a year-to-date basis, our comparable currency neutral profits are also up 9%. Let me take a moment to provide some detail on our SG&A expenditures. Our operating performance is a direct result of our continued investment in our brands all while maintaining disciplined cost measures and leveraging productivity benefits. We have benefited from productivity efforts across our marketing organization, leveraged more effective media buying, and made strategic decisions to adjust spending behind initiatives, with our bottling partners and customers to deliver the value the consumers expect in premium branded offerings. With respect to margins, our core business remains healthy, expanding margins on a year-to-date basis, despite incurring higher pension costs. Our Bottling Investments group continues to improve margins as well. Now let me address some of the factors that we see for the remainder of the year. First, building on Muhtar's earlier comments we are on track to deliver against our profit target for the year. With regard to currencies, as expected, currency has continued to improve throughout the year, as I mentioned earlier, currency negatively impacted our third quarter operating results by 11%. Based on current spot rates and our hedge positions, we expect currency headwinds to impact operating income by low double-digits for the full year. This implies that for the fourth quarter, we anticipate a low to mid single-digit currency tailwind. And it is certainly good to finally be able to say that. Further, if current spot rates hold we would not expect currencies to have the same severe headwinds as they did in 2009. However, our focus will continue to be of managing and investing in our business at the local market level and in local currencies to drive long-term growth and increase consumption of our brands. Next let me move to operating expense leverage. First, we continue to cycle the initial savings benefits of productivity programs while we incur higher pension costs. Second, and as I advised last quarter, we will have six fewer selling days in the fourth quarter. This means that while we will continue to reduce our expense base in the fourth quarter, much as we are able to in the third quarter the six fewer days will preclude us from capturing the operating expense leverage we have realized year-to-date in direct contrast to the significant benefit we experienced in the first quarter, when we had five additional selling days. Therefore despite this quarters positive leverage, you should expect operating expense leverage to be negative for the fourth quarter, and as such slightly positive for the second half of the year. Finally an update on our cash flow and cash usage. We continue to see strong cash flow from operations increasing 11% on a year-to-date basis. As we announced in our last call, we have reinstituted our share repurchase program by the end of the third quarter we had repurchased $241 million of our stock and are committed to repurchasing up to $1 billion of our stock by the end of this year. In closing, we believe we are meeting our commitments to our shareholders, delivering consistent quality growth, and investing for the future while also returning value via stock appreciation and dividends. We continue to be an attractive generator of strong free cash flow, with a fundamentally sound balance sheet. And while we recognize that the economic environment will likely remain challenging for consumers and customers as we move into 2010, we remain committed to driving profitable growth, gaining global share, and enhancing the value of our brands. Operator, now turn it over to questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from John Faucher, JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJohn Faucher: Yes. Thank you very much. A quick question, as you look across the weakness on the developed markets and I know you sort of talked about this. Can you focus on sort of how long-term you think these problems are? You know it seems like everyone is surprised by the weakness generally in the more developed markets. Is this a permanent retrenchment from the consumer or do you think we will see a fairly quick snap back when the economies normalize?\nMuhtar Kent: Yes John, good morning. I think you've got to look at it this way. Firstly, there is a lag between the macro economic growth coming back and consumer sentiments, and I think that we don't really all know how long that lag is, but there is a lag. And give you an example of Japan, although we've heard some positive news about the macro trends in Japan, when you look at the consumer psyche, when you look at supermarket spend in Japan over the last quarter is minus 7%, department stores down 16%, household expenditures down 3.5%. There's is some significant weak consumer sentiment. On the other hand, we see exports beginning to rebound. And I think, we will all watch and see how long this consumer sentiment is going to remain depressed and pressure on household expenditures. Similar -- not quite the same story in Europe, but I think Europe is a tale of two cities, Eastern Europe, Russia as well as, Central and Eastern Europe, very, very poor. But when you look at some key European marketplaces like, Belgium that was up 6% for us in this last quarter, Netherlands was up 4%, France was up 3, Italy was up 2, Germany up 1. So you see a different kind of consumer out there in terms of how they feel about their future and how they feel about their pocket book. No question that consumers have shifted their spending, spending more time at home, patterns of consumption are changing, restaurants are under a lot of pressure. But you've got Spain and really the worst kind of economic situation in Western Europe, together with Eastern Europe and you\u2019ve got some others like I have just mentioned in a fairly good space. I still believe that, the US is going to have to pull the general consumer sentiment up in the world, and the US consumers resiliency, we will probably see that happening. But I just don't have an idea about the timing and how that\u2019s going to occur in terms of exact timing. But there is a lag, I want to stress between macro trends that we are beginning to see some improvements in the recent IMS report, that significantly up the anti for macro growth trends for 2010 and the consumer sentiments. So, I just want to stress that. I just don't know what -- we will all watch and see how the lag is going to be. And then, I mentioned to you also before about my quadrant of four, in terms of how I see the recovery in general. I think China, India, Brazil, and others in that area, like Indonesia, Vietnam, places in the Middle East, Eurasia are all showing that recovery is on the way, we feel it. Continued volatility in Eastern Europe and Russia and Ukraine although the current oil price should be stabilizing things at the moment, as far as Russia and as far as some stimulus packages that we are hearing the Russian government is considering. And then, slower recovery in Western Europe and USA, and continued difficulty in Japan for the time being as far as the consumer is concerned. But I do -- I would be disappointed let me stress that if our volume numbers did not improve in Japan as we go forward.\nOperator: Our next question cops from Bill Pecoriello, Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.\nBill Pecoriello: Morning, everyone. My question on North America, if you could help us out. It looks like the still retail business might have been down double-digit in the quarter. Was that all bottled water, you mentioned aggressive price competition, so if you could expand on that? And I am wondering with the foreign currency upside coming and may be increasing US supply chain savings, are you looking to reinvest some of that back in the US, what might be more competitive spend coming ahead? Thanks.\nMuhtar Kent: Well answer to your first question is certainly we will look at all investment opportunities as we look forward into some possible benefits from currencies, and you\u2019ve seen us do that before, Bill. So I think you will just continue to see us always investing in our brands and in our business as we\u2019ve done throughout this year. In fact if you -- if you look at our total marketing spend this year, to coupled with in-store spend you\u2019re talking about 5 -- around 5% year-to-date. So we continue to spend even in times where we've had currency headwinds. So, we will certainly take advantage of that. As far as stills in the quarter, what you really see is certainly water is significant down, and that's really what\u2019s pulling our business, and that is mainly the bulk water business.\nBill Pecoriello: And the aggressive price competition was that in a certain segment?\nMuhtar Kent: That was more in the active lifestyle and sports segments in the latter part of the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlos Laboy, Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nCarlos Laboy: Yes. Good morning everyone. Two question, Muhtar. One is what has to be in it for Coke, if Coke is to see any merit in beer and soft drink integration going forward as you look at your vision for the year 2020? And the second one is single-serve and Minute Maid Pulpy is now becoming larger than brand Coke in some markets like Indonesia. Could you speak to where you see that brand going over the next couple of years?\nMuhtar Kent: The second question was on \u2013 Carlos good morning. The second question you had was on Minute Maid Pulpy, is that right?\nCarlos Laboy: Yeah, correct.\nMuhtar Kent: First, let me just address the Pulpy. I mean, we're now in eight countries and year-to-date June unit cases were up for the first half of the year, more than 50% certainly driven by China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Pakistan. I mean our business in juice and juice drinks now in China is almost 20% of the 1.3 billion case business, and driving really hard and certainly we see tremendous organic growth going forward in many markets including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Pakistan, Indonesia. We intend to continue our horizontal expansion, continue to innovate. We've got new products like white grape, (aloe vera), lemon tropical mix and now super milky pulpy in China. We've sold in the first few days 24 million bottles and we will sell in the next 120 days, 240 million bottles or more of this product in China. We certainly see a lot of opportunity in both horizontal expansion, secondly innovation and further vertical growth in this juice drink area, and you will see us also expanding into other continents from where we are. As far as mere consolidation is concerned, I've shared with you previously my view. And my view of soft drinks integration has not really changed since the day that I was managing aboard on bottling terms, and that is the strategic functions need to be separate and you can for benefiting both businesses. If there are synergies in non-strategic areas like freight warehousing, back office, I think in this day and age you can't leave those on your table. You've got to take advantage of those. But at the front end, which is, you are talking about a different consumer, different consumption pattern, different regulations I think it's absolutely important to keep the strategic functions dedicated to each side, and that's been my view on it and that remains my view on it. And I do not think that there is long-term significant synergistic benefit to combining totally the two businesses and having the same sales system, having the same market development system because this fundamental differences between product distribution servicing and also in velocities, channels, price compliance, other issues. And there is never the same footprint between aisle of carrying sparkling beverages and beer. And there is a huge difference in the number of channels and a significant difference in consumption patterns and also the consumer itself. So that remains my view on the subject.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christine Farkas, Bank of America. Your line is open.\nChristine Farkas: Muhtar, I was wondering if you get just a little bit more into detail on North America. The price mix was described up as 1%. Just in light of concentrate pricing model, the mix that you talked about the shift of the holiday also would be helpful to understand how much that holiday shift hurt volumes and maybe impact from energy drinks, if any. If you could just shed a little bit of light on the North American trends. Gary, I just want to understand in terms of the buyback, why we don't see the dollar amount on your cash flow statement in the third quarter.\nMuhtar Kent: Well, let me just address the first piece and Gary will take it on a second. We believe there are three keys to achieving healthy sustainable growth in North America. Healthy brands, healthy customer relationships and a healthy system that's capable of working in unison to serve our customers in the most effective and efficient way. With regards to healthy brands, we continue to build strong value-creating brands as evidence by our improved brand health on Coke trademark and increased revenues and system profitability. With regards to healthy customer relationships, we work very well with our entire U.S. system on cooperative customer program I mentioned one in my remarks and that's increasing our ability to create healthy value creating relationships with the customers. And healthy system, we accelerate system collaboration. We have accelerated system collaboration on supply chain productivity through Coca-Cola supply, which is on track to exceed our three-year goal of 150 million. The successful integration of our recently acquired businesses and the implementation of procure to pay and other operating disciplines, which are removing waste at a fast pace in areas of operating expense. And then we continue to build on our strong aligned position of the system, driving the expansion of key enterprise initiative and best practice that are designed to increase our ability to drive the benefits of what we call virtual integration, expansion of our incidence-based pricing model across other bottlers, deployment of the right execution daily, looks of success, the new architecture for brand-price-pack-channel really looking well, local integration of our food service business in select markets this summer and learnings from there. So, I think there is a lot of things going on and I just want to stress one thing, you know as of today, I stated I think before, bottlers representing almost all of the U.S. volume, 99% that are members of our counsel where we have pricing unity, SKU agreements, the big event support to coordinate selling periods, like holidays with key customers across regions and so forth. So all of that I think are working in our favor for the long-term. You asked a question about holiday shifts and we don't usually disclose the impact. What is the exact impact of that holiday shift, but obviously you know from past experiences that it's not insignificant. And Gary, you want to take the question on share buybacks?\nGary Fayard: Yeah. Number one, there are quite a few people on the controllers groups that will be happy that you asked the question proving that someone actually reads the statements in detail. But there is a reason, we have several things going on within the quarter, such as the special dividend that Coca-Cola Hellenic has announced now, and because of that, felt like we needed to be out of the market for legal reasons. And then once all of that was announced in public and all, we went into the market but it was actually at the very end of the quarter and therefore their shares had not settled and so you don't see on the cash flow statement, but we had actually bought them. They just didn't settle until the following Monday.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Swartzberg, Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.\nMark Swartzberg: Muhtar, also on North America, with the sparkling down 5% I was hoping you could give us some more detail on how broad based this was across channels and whether any particular channel led that pick up in rate of decline. And then similarly as you look at packages, how did single serve perform sequentially in there and any commentary beyond what your prepared remarks were on package changes in trend for a particular package sizes.\nMuhtar Kent: I think there is no question as certain channels still remain challenging and we expect them to continue to be a challenge. But we do, our brand house as I said scores are improving. I think the packaging innovations like the big bottle shrink multi-pack, the 50-ounce twin pack, two-liter contour, are really getting traction despite the price increases in revenue per bottle, significant increases. The expanded multi-pack can offers are performing well, entry price packs like $0.99 continue to generate incremental transactions and then we expect some very good momentum from our new calorie conscious offerings like 90 calorie (inaudible) mini can. I think we have made excellent progress, I would say on resolving system business issues over the last year or so including our brand portfolio, system economic model. And I do think that generally speaking, there has been a shift as we said from the July 4th impacting the total volume for the quarter, but we believe that our single packs particularly still are performing very well. The $0.99 offering is providing extra transactions in the convenience store retail channel and we see, we think that all these initiatives together with our strong brand held should see us, I would be disappointed if we didn\u2019t improve our results in North America going forward. And I don\u2019t think, I the impacts on retail is not tied to a specific channel, its more broad based tied to overall consumer sentiment.\nMark Swartzberg: Great. And if I could on the single serve element in there. Is it fair to think that the trends there got a little more challenging in the third quarter?\nMuhtar Kent: It\u2019s difficult to say, Mark. I think you\u2019ve got to take it into the realm of the shift in the holiday, and we are still seeing continued challenges in the convenience store channel in single-serve and also eat and drink channel certainly more people spending time at home, more consumption shifting to the house, but we are still seeing growth in our single-serve packages incremental transactions.\nMark Swartzberg: Great, thanks.\nMuhtar Kent: That's the key.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Marc Greenberg, Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMarc Greenberg: My question relates to the bottling investments. I wanted to get some sense from you as to how much potential margin improvement we should be think about in the coming year. The margins were just under 4% in the quarter, wanted to get a sense as how much incremental benefit might come through from lower inputs as well as continued volume growth. I know Gary in the past you have talked about benchmarking this to other bottlers. Where do you think we are in this process and is the 10% bottler investment margin still a reasonable goal? Thanks.\nGary Fayard: As Irial has said in the past his long-term goal for the Bottling Investments Group would be to go for a 10% kind of margin, we are at four now which is a significant improvement from a couple of years ago when it was negative. So we are seeing a really good sequential year-on-year and quarter-by-quarter improvement. But I would say the 10% is still a long-term target multiple years away. Because remember most of the bottlers we have, we own because they were in trouble or they were troubled bottlers. So we are fixing them, if you will. While there's going be a lot of commodity relief particularly as you look at some of the US bottlers et cetera particularly around aluminum, and probably around corn sweetener, if you look at them and juice actually looks like it is going to be down in price next year as well. Actually for the Bottling Investments group there will be some pressure because sugar actually has gone up pretty significantly in pricing, just because of some shortages of sugar. In fact there is some rationing of sugar going on right now in India. And PET prices have increased as well, just due to the part of the price of oil. So I don't see a lot of that upside from commodities within our BIG group itself. But they continue to improve year-on-year and I would expect to see that continue kind of like we have seen in the past.\nMuhtar Kent: Just let me add, Mark. Firstly I am pleased with the progress that Irial and his team are making in improving the financial dynamics of our BIG, Bottling Investment Group and company at bottling operations. I certainly also expect improvements to continue and as Gary said, the double-digit margin is certainly a long-term target, but every single year, all of the time, we expect the business to generate better financial results, as well as continuing to invest and really world class execution in all of the markets. I go a lot of Bottling Investment Group markets and visit the marketplace with people who run those businesses. I was recently in Sweden just crossed over from Denmark and again saw that both the opportunity as well as the improvements that they have made all that, and this is true for every market that they operate in. So, I think as we move forward, certainly Germany is a very key and important piece of this improvement, we will have sequential improvement. China under the leadership of Martin Jansen, our Chinese bottling operations will continue to see. Philippines, again we just also have new leadership in the Philippines and we will continue to see improvement coming from the Philippines. I expect the improvement to come as well as in India of course and I expect to see these improvements coming every year leading up to double-digit margins.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson, Citi Investment Research. Your line is open.\nWendy Nicholson: Can you talk a little bit more about the North American market and what you are doing in terms of shifts in your marketing mix? I know you said that, I think marketing was up 5% year-to-date. But how much of that is advertising and given the weakness in the consumer sentiment that you have talked about. Are you finding still higher promotional levels to be more effective than advertising, and what strategy is going toward?\nMuhtar Kent: Wendy, I think you need to see that in the realm of what we have completely as we said before re-architecting our brand-price-pack-channel mix inside the four walls of the customers, be it supermarket, or hypermarket, or convenience retail. And we have a lot of initiatives also in the food service area. So taking all of that into context, that\u2019s why we see a great opportunity to communicate more with the consumer at the point-of-sale, more effectively using better innovative tools, and therefore we have increased our overall direct in-store merchandising and advertising and indirect sampling investments behind our brands, that is reflected in our strong brand held growth for Coke trademark, vitaminwater and Powerade. And we continue to co-invest with our bottlers in funding design to accelerate our ability to offer consumers affordable value and inspiring new products, new packages, just like the two liter contour twin-packs, the new can, the $0.99 et cetera. And I think what we are fining is all of that plus the digital media is really beginning to come together and creating a really effective marketing mix for us in the US marketplace.\nWendy Nicholson: And is it fair to say that that's working particularly well simply given the macro environment we are, but that that's still in the broader context. Just correct me if I am wrong. The price-pack architecture has been around for a little while, and certainly has become more important. But I guess longer-term kind of the marketing mix algorithm for you in the US has that changed permanently to de-emphasize traditional media?\nMuhtar Kent: How much of it is due to our new brand-price-pack architecture, how much of it is due to the current marketplace dynamics is difficult to say. Firstly the price brand-price-pack-channel architecture is an evolution. We have only got if I said 40% distribution with our two-liter contour bottles. So we are continuing to roll all of this out. So it is not something that has been around for a long time. We are just rolling out the new 90 calorie mini cans. We are still expanding the $0.99 contour bottle. So there's a lot going on in the marketplace. If you go into the marketplace today in the United States, and you don't have to even go into one of the blue stones of CC, but if you actually go into the normal marketplace, visit any supermarket where our brand-price-pack-channel architecture is being changed you will see the difference. You will see how we are communicating, you will see the points of interruption, you\u2019ll see how the in-store media and marketing is coming together with our new packaging.\nOperator: You have a further question from Judy Hong, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJudy Hong: Muhtar, just some color in terms of Russia and Eastern Europe, obviously the macros are still challenging in those marks and you have talked about the lag in some of these markets. But now it has been three or four quarters of sort of high single to double-digit volume decline in Russia. I am just wondering if you do get a sense of whether the consumers are close to bottoming there and how we should think about the trend going forward in some of those more challenging markets. And then in those markets are you also really expanding some of these affordable packaging and price mix or price-pack architecture, why aren't they responding as well as maybe some of the other markets?\nMuhtar Kent: Well, because I think Eastern Europe is a land of volatility and things always are deeper and much more colorful based on my experience. And again, firstly, the volatility is much higher in Russia and Ukraine than it is in eastern, traditional Eastern Europe and Central Europe like Baltic\u2019s and Poland and so forth, Central Europe, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia and so forth. So it\u2019s not as deep and the volatility is not as apparent and significant in East and Central Europe as it is in Russia. I think we have seen most of the volatility already take place in Russia. I feel that. I was there in Russia a couple of months ago with the Chairman of our bottling partner Coca-Cola Hellenic, and the CEO and we sat down and looked at the market, visited the customers and looked (that\u2019s law) of distribution and stores in the market. I think the consumer sentiment that we see is one that past most of the volatility. That's my feeling, although it is always difficult to say with Russia and Ukraine. But I do believe that we have seen a significant dips in consumer spending, real estate has toppled, consumer spending has come down, supermarket revenues are down, retail revenues are down and every shop owner you speak to they talk about revenues being down. I think we have past most of that going into the future. As far as East and Central Europe is concerned, the dip has been lower in places like Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary even in Southeast Europe, Romania, probably Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Former Yugoslavia is a little worst than the other parts. So I would say probably Russia will see some more bright sunshine as we move forward although not fully out in terms of consumer sentiment and then East and Central Europe probably still a slow recovery than that.\nJudy Hong: Then Gary just a follow-up on currency you have talked about 2010 not being as the sizable headwinds as 2009, but I mean are there any hedges that you've already layered in that might mitigate the benefit that you would see on the currency side if you just look at the spot rates of the major currencies?\nGary Fayard: No, Judy. No, in fact our hedging program is more an auction based strategy. So, even if we called it wrong, in all we would still have the upside. So no, the only hedge that you heard in my comments was I know where the spot rates are today, I do not know where the spot rates will be next year. So I think we just as -- and I will keep you updated as we go into the year and all but there is no negative on our side that would cause anything other than what you see today.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Gary and Jackson. As mentioned at the outset of our call, and as part of our continued efforts to provide you with a broader view across our business, and our 2020 vision, as we said we will be hosting an investor and analyst event here in Atlanta on November 16th and 17th. Gary and I together with members of our global company and bottler system leadership will discuss how we intent to usher in a new era of winning for our company and our system. So, I look forward to continuing our conversations around the opportunities that lay ahead for the Coca-Cola Company at this event and I thank if you for joining us this morning.\nOperator: Thank you participating in today\u2019s conference call with thecoca-colacompany.com.

I am joined by: Muhtar Kent, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Gary Fayard, our Chief Financial Officer; and Pancho Reyes, our Latin America Group President. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions. Before we get started I would like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report.  In addition, I would also like to note that we have posted schedules on our company website at www.thecoca-colacompany.com under the Reports and Financial Information tab in the Investor section which reconciles certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to by our senior executives in our discussion this morning and from time to time in discussing our financial performance as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. Please look on our website for this information. Now, let me turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: Good morning everyone. I am pleased to report another excellent quarter of growth for the Coca-Cola Company despite difficult global market conditions. Today we are positioned better than ever to grow share and build value in the dramatically changing world. The fundamentals of our business remain strong. Our company is growing: growing volume, growing revenue, as well as profits on a currency neutral basis, building share, and strengthening brand health. And importantly, we're delivering against our expectations with first half results in line or above our long-term growth targets. For the first half of the year, unit case volume increased 3%, adding another 200.0 million unit cases, or about the size of our annual volume in Chile, our 18th largest market globally. On a comparable currency neutral basis, net revenues increased 3% and operating income increased 9%. For the first half of the year, comparable EPS is down 7% due to the expected currency translation impact. We continue to invest our robust cash flow and profits into key markets and growth strategies, which in turn enables us to deliver solid performance in fast-growing economies like India, Brazil, Mexico, and China. These investments also give us the ability to expand our footprint in these key market economies. Consider China, for example, where we just opened two new plants last month and the PanAsian Innovation Center at the end of last year. We now have 38 fully operational factories in this growing and dynamic country. I am also pleased with how our associates are acting as true owners, running this high-margin business with a low-margin mentality while redoubling their efforts to identify areas of cost savings, savings that are being prudently reinvested back into the business. And we are executing on our productivity initiatives and delivering tangible results. We are on track to achieve our $500.0 million target by the end of 2011 and expect to deliver more than half of the promised savings by the end of this year. I am confident that our strong brands and solid business fundamentals are the assets that are being leveraged by our seasoned management team to meet our long-term targets this year. And while we are on track and performing well in the first half of the year, as I said on our last call, there may be bumps along the way, given the continued global recession and economic volatility. For the quarter, we continued to deliver consistent and balanced top- and bottom-line performance results. Globally, our unit case volume for the quarter increased an outstanding 4% at the top end of our long-term growth targets. Our international operations remain significant contributors to our solid performance results and increased unit case volume by 5%, factoring 5% from the prior year. Our franchise system leveraged the strength of our leading brands geographic footprint and global reach and scale to drive unit case growth around the world. In Latin America, Mexico and Argentina grew 6% and Brazil was up 5%. In Europe, Northwest Europe was up 6% on strong performance in Great Britain as well as France. And in Eurasia and Africa, India was up 33%, Nigeria grew 9%, Southern Eurasia was up 5%, and Turkey up 4%. And in the Pacific, China grew 14%, the twentieth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Viet Nam was up 12%, Korea and Thailand increased 9% and Japan volume grew 2% despite GDP contracting 8%. Finally, we continue to gain strength in many emerging markets. For example, in our 120 countries with per caps less than 150, our volume growth was 8% for the quarter, factoring 6% from the prior year. Our volume results also underscore the continued efforts of our system to deliver our consumers the right brand, in the right pack, at the right price, in the right channel, for any consumption occasion. We can do this because of the strength and alignment we have with our bottling partners across the world. As we have said before, share gain and brand health are key success metrics. For billions of consumers around the world, Coca-Cola and all our brands remain an affordable luxury. In fact, once again this quarter, we gained non-alcoholic, ready-to-drink volume and value share, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of globally winning share in both. We have continued to outperform the industry across most key categories and geographies and are aggressively looking for opportunities to profitably gain share from competitors. Sustained and increasing levels of consumer spending are driving improvements in our brand health scores, which measure consumers' favorite brands. Our scores have improved in markets that account for over 75% of our current volume. We are leveraging this growth in brand health by creating the perfect shopper experience, outlet by outlet, with a unique system that visits 20.0 million customers weekly. These improvements in share and brand health provide us confidence that we will continue to experience growth across key categories and geographies. Our system must also continue working together to commercialize innovations faster than ever before and to accelerate growth of trademark Coca-Cola to win with consumers, both today and tomorrow. This is a wonderful growth business to be in. Alongside our system partners, we are focused on investing together for growth to achieve what we call our 2020 Vision. You will continue to hear more about this throughout this year. Now let me move to our strategic initiatives by taking a look back and a look forward from our vantage point, halfway through this year. At the beginning of the year, we told you that we believe there would be continued and even increasing challenges for our global economy and that these challenges would create a tough environment for our consumers, our customers, and our franchise system. However, we also told you that we remain resolute in our belief that the unique value and quality of our brands, the strength of our system and the result of our people would deliver sound performance despite these headwinds. Our management's clear focus on a consistent set of strategic initiatives is proving successful and we're taking advantage of all opportunities to emerge strong from this crisis. We remain realistic about the risks and excited about the opportunities that we face in the short term as well as the long term.  We must win every day: win with consumers; win with customers; and franchise partners\u2014the three pillars of our business. All of this starts with consumers and winning with our portfolio, first and foremost with Coca-Cola and sparkling beverages.  Globally, Coca-Cola, the world's most valuable brand at almost $80.0 billion in retail sales grew volume 3% and Coke Zero grew 11% for the quarter. Unit case volume for sparkling beverages was led by broad base international growth of 4%.  Some highlights for sparkling beverage growth from around the world include: India, up 35%; China, up 14%; Great Britain growing 7%; Japan, 6%; Brazil, 4%; Argentina, 3%; and South Africa, 2%. Sprite was driven by international growth of 11%, led by China, India, and Pakistan. An interest and highlight is brand Coca-Cola's performance in Latin America. In what many would consider as one of the world's most developed sparkling geographies, we grew brand Coca-Cola 3% in both Mexico and Argentina and 6% in Brazil this past quarter. We're often asked how we are able to do this, given the strength of our per caps that already exist in this part of the world. Simply said, it is a result of the pure strength and momentum of a brand that has been built in Latin America over a hundred years. Revenue growth strategies based on consumer and customer insights provide us with the capabilities to clearly figment with packaging, pricing, and channel initiatives. Across Latin America and in close alignment with our bottling partners, we are focused on special price points to drive consumption, adjusting packaging initiatives towards refillable and value propositions, expanding cooler placements to ensure our products are within an arm's reach of desire, and I know Pancho Reyes, president of our Coca-Cola Latin America group looks forward to answering your questions about our business and inner geography during our Q&A session this call. Our integrated Open Happiness campaign is now running in markets that represent 75% of total Coca-Cola volume. This is the fastest global roll out of a campaign from our company and it speaks to speed as a strategic initiative as we operate in a real-time world. Recruitment, as well as retention, are the focus of strong point-of-sale execution targeted towards moms and teens, as well as Coke and Meals programming. If you dialed into the call early enough this morning, you will have heard the number one pop song in China, Open Happiness. The single recently hit the number one spot on four leading Chinese music charts and the Open Happiness music video premiered just last week on MTV in the U.S. While traditional marketing avenues will continue to play a critical role as a key medium to connect our brands with consumer passions, we are also shifting to more digital media.  Globally, 19.0 million consumers, of which over 40% are under the age of 25, are registered in our databases to engage with our brands by our loyalty and online brand experiences. In the United States My Coke Rewards, with 12.0 million members, is the largest online consumer packaged goods program. Our still beverage unit case volume increased 8% as we focused on organic growth and leveraged our recent strategic acquisitions. Internationally, still beverages were up 12%. We gained beverage volume and value share globally, driven by VitaminWater and our global juice, tea, sports drinks, and energy brands.  We continue to provide consumers with innovative products across diverse beverage occasions. Valley Fruits is delivering significant results in juice drinks across Latin America and building the Hugos de Valle acquisition using an innovative product formula developed in the Pacific under Minute Maid Pulpy. Also late in the quarter we launched Hugo. This dairy and juice beverage, introduced in Chile, represents our commitment to create new categories that meet new consumer needs. We are also making strategic investments in exciting new beverages like Innocent, the premium smoothie and juice brand in the United Kingdom.  Glauceau, led by VitaminWater and SmartWater continues to gain volume and value share. In the U.S. VitaminWater 10 is is generating incremental transactions and reaching an expanded consumer base with strong repeats and minimal cannibalization. We'll be launching four brand new VitaminWater 10 flavors early in the third quarter. Our second pillar is winning with our customers. When we sit down with our customers, it's a simple conversation. We want to understand their growth plan and then develop programs for our brands to drive revenues at rates in excess of our customers' plans. We want our customers to be as excited about investing in beverages as we are.  And our conversations are working. In this difficult environment, larger retailers are the ones taking share and we are winning with our key customers. Through May, we grew volume 8% in our top ten global retail customers. Part of the success is continuing to innovate with equipment that engages consumers and drives traffic for customers. Freestyle, our break-through fountain dispensing technology, which enables consumers to select from over 100 branded beverages, continues to test well in field trials. Our interactive video vending machine won the global award at the 2009 Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival. This video vendor transforms simple transactions into dynamic brand interactions. In North America, Fuze is being significantly expanded in a fountain format. This past quarter we announced the addition of Fuze in 22,500 subway outlets.  Additionally, McDonald's has agreed to introduce VitaminWater Triple X into a majority of their U.S. restaurants over the next 18 months. These are just a few examples of our commitment and clear focus on finding the right solutions to grow together with our customers. Our strategy is winning with our franchise systems. During the quarter we continued to deliver balanced growth and performed well in Latin America with volume up 6% and we remain optimistic about growth in Latin America for the remainder of the year. Also China and India both continue to be strong contributors to our growth in the way of winning volume and value share in both sparkling and full categories in these important geographies. To drive continued growth in these critical geographies, we are investing significantly in route to market strategies, technology, infrastructure, and consumer marketing, as well as in our talented people. Japan outperformed the non-alcoholic beverage industry resulting in our fifth consecutive quarter of share gains. Our success in growing sparkling beverages in Japan continues with trademark Coca-Cola up 10%, the eleventh consecutive quarter of growth.  This demonstrates that by applying the basic Coca-Cola way of marketing and selling and by executing flawlessly, we can keep growing Coca-Cola in one of our most developed markets in the world. Additionally, Coca-Cola Zero continued its strong performance in Japan, further winning category share. SokenbichaTea rebounded with a 9% growth and we recently launched two high-value brands, En Caf\u00e9 and Glauceau VitaminWater. Georgia coffee's results were disproportionately impacted by the economic slowdown in vending channels but we are optimistic that this brand will turn around as market conditions begin to improve.  We continue to work hard to ensure that we are delivering solid performance in Japan during this challenging economic climate. In Europe we are weathering the storm better than many despite the fact that the economic crisis is a constant reality for consumers. Volume in Europe increased 1% for the quarter. We are winning where it counts, with consumers in the market. We gained volume and value share across key countries as the non-alcoholic beverage industry slowed, especially in away-from-home channels. We are applying consistent global strategies in Europe with a clear focus on winning at the point of sale, appealing to moms and teens through programs such as Coke with Meals, offering value propositions and positive price points and adjusting packaging for the right occasions. We expect the retail environment in Europe to remain challenging throughout 2009 but we continue to proactively identify opportunities to capture share and maintain a strict focus on winning behind our key brands, particularly trademark Coca-Cola. In North America, just like everywhere else in the world, our operations are focused on building healthy brands, healthy consumer and customer relationships, and a healthy system which are the keys for sustainable growth. During the quarter volume was down 1% as we continued to outperform the industry, gaining slight volume share and significant value share. Separately, our still beverage portfolio led the industry in growth for the eight consecutive quarter, driving volume and value share gains in sports drinks, active lifestyle beverages, teas, and energy drinks, as well as the continue value share gains in juice. We have a clear and aligned systems strategy for delivering sustainable, profitable growth and we are leading the industry in building value creating brands. And in concert with our bottlers we are building on our successes to get our vocation, brand, price, pack, and channel architecture right. The implementation of incidence pricing is going well and is being applied to more than 80% of our volumes. Our new pricing model supports our new sparkling package architecture, including the new immediate consumption recruitment packs. This enables our company and bottling partners to jointly focus on building consumer occasions maximizing brand reach and generating value. Importantly, having the right pricing architecture in North America as we do internationally is part of how we will unlock sustainable, profitable growth. For example, we believe that today's equivalent of the old nickel Coke is our ninety-nine cent cold contour bottle. Today, in 90% of the U.S., we offer an ice-cold contour bottle of Coca-Cola for ninety-nine cents, an affordable price point that recruits new consumers. This initiative is generating 1.0 million new and incremental transactions for our system every single week.  Additionally, on the productivity side, Coca-Cola supplies already delivering savings which are being reinvested by the system to build sustainable, competitive advantages. We are encouraged about our growth opportunities in North America. We believe we have the right strategy and a system that is jointly committed to being more effective and efficient. To recap, I am pleased with the results we have delivered in the first half of the year. Our business fundamentals remain strong. We continue to be a consistent and stable cash generator with increasing dividends and a commitment to investing diligently for the future while rewarding our shareholders. We have the brands, the reach, and the scale to capture real opportunity, both today and tomorrow. And we remain relentlessly focused on effectively operating in what I consider to be world's best consumer business. And with that, let me now turn the call over to Gary.\nGary P. Fayard: As Muhtar indicated, our company is growing in volume, revenue, profits, and share. The fundamentals of the business remain strong. Our further share gains and brand health improvements reflect our experienced management teams ability to utilize the assets of the Coca-Cola system to deliver tangible results and value for our shareholders. We delivered on our commitments, growing volume and profits in line with our long-term growth model for the first half of the year, even excluding the impact of the five additional selling days that we had in the first quarter. For the second quarter, we delivered solid results across a diverse geographic footprint with unit case volume growth at the top end of our expectations. This, of course, includes some benefit to our volume growth from the holiday shifts of Easter and the Fourth of July, and the cycling of 3% volume growth in the prior-year period. Reported operating income declined to 9%, primarily related to a 14% currency headwind. Comparable currency neutral operating income for the quarter came in better than we expected at 4%, cycling 9% from the second quarter of last year. For the first half of the year we exceeded our long-term currency neutral profit target, increasing operating income 9%. As outlined in our release, we reported earnings per share of $0.88 per share on a diluted basis for the second quarter of 2009. As expected, this included charges related to our restructuring and ongoing productivity initiatives at both the company and our equity invested bottlers. In total, we had a net charge of $0.04 per share. Therefore, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.92 per share, a decrease of 9% after considering items impacting comparability in both the current and prior year and again, significantly impacted by currency headwinds in the quarter. Additionally, $0.01 per share was related to the timing of expenses in corporate, which we expect to reverse in the second half of the year. Net revenue in the quarter decreased 9%, which included a 9% effect from currency headwinds and a 2% drag from structural changes primarily related to our divestment of bottlers. At the same time, net revenue was positively impacted by a 3% increase in concentrate sales. Price mix for the quarter was slightly negative, reflecting our current focus to drive greater affordability initiatives across many markets to ensure we continue building brand relevance and equity with consumers. Additionally, our Japan business was impacted by shifts away from the at-work vending channel, due to the economic environment. We believe this is temporary and will moderate as more manufacturing facilities in Japan come back on line. As a result, net revenues, excluding the structural changes, were up 2% for the quarter. Now let me address some of the factors that we see for the remainder of the year. First, our picture of success for 2009 remains the same: to meet our long-term growth targets.  On currency, as expected, global currency fluctuations negatively impacted the translation of reported results this quarter, however, our operators, who are held accountable in their local currencies, are driving local investments to support sustainable growth. While currency exchange rates have generally improved throughout the year, it is important to look at today's rates relative to the prior year. For example, the average spot rate was $1.54 for the Euro in Q3 2008 versus our current spot rate of around $1.42. Also, note that the U.S. dollar has appreciated significantly against a basket of emerging market currencies. Therefore, based on current expectations, including the rates we're cycling and hedges in place for key hard currencies, we anticipate a 12% to 14% currency headwind for the third quarter and a low single-digit currency headwind for the fourth quarter. Of course, there are many different scenarios that could play out as the market's risk perspective continues to evolve. But I can assure you we will continue to carefully manage our risk exposure and keep you updated as we move through the remainder of the year. Next let's move to operating expense leverage. First, as we move in the second half, we will begin to cycle the initial savings benefits of our productivity programs. Second, we will continue to incur higher pension costs and cycle lower incentive costs for the remainder of the year. And third, we will have six fewer selling days in the fourth quarter. This means that while we will continue to reduce our expense base in the fourth quarter, the rate of reduction will be lower than the revenue decrease we will experience as a result of having six fewer days in the quarter.  So essentially, the opposite of the significant benefit we experienced in the first quarter when we had five additional selling days. Therefore, you should expect operating leverage to be essentially flat for the second half of the year, even as we continue to benefit from our ongoing productivity initiatives. Below the operating profit line, we will have the full impact of higher interest costs related to the $2.25 billion in term debt that we placed in March and the continuing impact of currencies on equity income related to our bottlers. As a reminder, our revenues will continue to be impacted by the sale of our Pakistan bottler investment at the end of the third quarter last year. Next to taxes. We ended the quarter with an underlying effective tax rate of 23.5% and we estimate that our underlying effective rate will remain in the range of 23.5% for the remainder of the year. Finally, a comment on our cash. Given the 14% increase in year-to-date cash flow from operations, we are restarting our share repurchase program and expect to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our stock during the remainder of 2009. In closing, I believe our first half performance is indicative of a company that is growing and delivering in a challenging market while continuing to build on our record of success. We are on track to meet our long-term growth targets for the year and are optimistic about the tremendous growth opportunities in the beverage industry. Our 2020 Vision lays out a clear road map for our system and we have a skilled leadership team with the right plan and capabilities to achieve our goals alongside our bottling partners. Again, Muhtar and I are pleased that Pancho Reyes has joined our call this morning. I know he looks forward to addressing any of your questions related to our Latin American operations. We are now ready for questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Faucher - J.P. Morgan.\nJohn Faucher - J.P. Morgan: A question for Pancho. Can you talk a little bit about some of the regional differences in performance in Mexico. We had been hearing that the north was a little bit weaker, given concerns about swine flu and the U.S. economy, but looking at the overall numbers it seems that the south must be holding it's own. And secondly, we're that Big Cola may be expanding in Brazil, so any thoughts on that in terms of with the economy having softened a little bit whether you're seeing it a little more right from a B brand standpoint.\nJos\u00e9 Octavio (Pancho) Reyes: Our performances in Mexico, they are pretty stable throughout the country. The north and the south have performed relatively in the same terms so the overall numbers that you are seeing are comfortable both in every geography in Mexico. B brands, yes, B brands are always a consideration, especially under tough economic situations like the one we're facing. But I have seen in the specific was the birthplace, if you will, of the B brands, back twenty years ago probably, so therefore it's not unusual for somebody else to come into that market. I would think that it is a crowded B brand market, by the way. And we welcome the competition come in from Big Cola if that would be the case. I think that we have a system that can deal with that threat and hopefully we will continue to prove it, as we go along in this environment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge.\nBill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge: If you could flush out a little bit more for us the price mix that was down around 1% in the quarter and you made comments about driving affordability. The underlying kind of concentrate revenue per unit, is that going up in line with the bottlers raising price around the world to recoup offsetting effects and commodity increases? And also, what exactly is happening in the price mix in the bottling division in markets like Germany, Philippines? How much is that a drag on the price mix? Should we expect that to continue into the second half?\nMuhtar Kent: I'll let Gary talk about this, but just in general, basically our price mix generally improved around the world with a couple of exceptions that somewhat relate to those deterrents with BIT certainly. But in general terms I think we are on track and on target with our price mix plan and we are actually progressing better than our plan in many of our geographies.\nGary P. Fayard: A little detail, if you looked at price mix, it was about 1% negative in the quarter and flat year-to-date. Something like that, or plus 1% year-to-date, I guess. If you look at it, we have positive price mix in every operating group across the world except for two: Bottling Investments Group and the Pacific. On Bottling Investments Group it is pretty much entirely a function of what's happened in the Philippines and in Germany, two markets that are significantly impacted economically.  And within the Pacific is almost entirely all because of Japan. And there it's really a function of channel brand function. It's really Georgia Coffee primarily in at-work vending. And what we've got is you've got a lot of automobile factories, etc., that have been closed due to the economic environment. We are seeing those start to come back on line now and that's why we are cautiously optimistic that this thing is going to turn around. But you've got a high revenue channel and high profit brands in that at-work vending. Basically the Japan vending at-work and Germany and the Philippines is the whole thing. Everybody else was positive. Just to follow up one other piece on your question, generally, most of the world, I'd say, is on some type of incidence pricing and therefore we and the bottlers are both benefiting, and both investing jointly together in driving the right brands, the right packages and the right channels. So we're doing it together and we 're in this together.\nBill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge: So maybe a little bit of improvement in the back half as Japan vending comes back a little bit?\nGary P. Fayard: Yes, I would expect so. I think we will continue to see, probably a difficult situation in the Philippines. Probably in Germany as well. You've got a little negative just because kind of channel and all in Spain, because as you know, the Spanish unemployment is sky-high right now. So much related to the construction industry. So it's some specific markets.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Carlos Laboy - Credit Suisse.\nCarlos Laboy - Credit Suisse: Pancho, Muhtar referenced the strength of the brands in his comments in Latin America. But how critical is it to the performance of the region that Latin American is anchored by a bottler with a 10-year concentrate price model? In a core market in a 50/50 long term profits but for non-cores? But could you be hitting these numbers without this kind of clarity and profits with looking out over the long term. And on a related basis for Muhtar, as you go into the round of planning sessions with bottlers, why not embrace some of these multi-year incidence agreements?\nJos\u00e9 Octavio (Pancho) Reyes: I cannot speculate on how important that is. I believe that our bottlers in Latin America, and I've said this time and time again, are perhaps the best bottlers in the world. I think we have a great system. I believe that we have a great brand. I believe we have a firm belief on the power and on the potential of brand core cola. And I believe that we have a system that knows what to do and how to do it and that is the important piece.\nMuhtar Kent: I think the key question, the key thing, in this business is how do you really ensure that you have constructive dialogue and constructive alignment and constructive tension in this business that moves the business forward in one direction continuously and that it operates as a single system, focused on generating consumer occasions and customer partnership. And I think incidence does that in many respects and I have always, as a bottler, worked very well under incidence and have instituted many incidence programs with our bottling partners. So I you ask me in terms of multi\u2014and it has to be multi-year because the picture of success in this business, as I've outlined before, is you get into a room of bottlers and you actually agree on a picture of success, five, ten years down the road. Long-term planning is key. And continuing to invest in this business, always with a focus is key, with both innovation on our side, inspirational marketing on our side, equipment on the side of the bottlers, and new sales systems and socioeconomic segmentation that drives revenue in a proper way. And I think incidence does all of those in the best way. So you're talking to someone who believes it's a great way to align the system.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company: Muhtar, can you give us your assessment of the macro, the consumer environment, particularly markets like Russia or Eastern Europe where trends have been pretty weak. Are you seeing trends stabilizing and as you think about the 4% volume growth number in the fourth quarter and as you look out maybe 6 to 12 months out where GDP growth broadly should start to accelerate, are we at a point where now volume growth, even that 4% number, could start to show even better trend going forward?\nMuhtar Kent: Think of four different quadrants. That's how I like to think of the future that's going to be ahead of us. Think of four different quadrants as far as the consumer sentiment is concerned.  On the top left quadrant, you've got Europe, you've got North America, and maybe a couple of other economies where we will probably be experiencing resets in terms of the consumer psyche where they will probably do things differently than they have done in the past. And mostly related to probably non-durable, you know, in terms of durable consumer consumption habits. But also in general, there'll be a reset in the mind.  And then on the top right you've got markets like China, India, other parts, Brazil, where I think very strong, quick rebound. Then on the bottom left quadrant you've got a Japan, stagnation.  And then you've got part of the question that you asked about Eastern Europe, Russia, Ukraine, on the bottom right quadrant, which is basically I call volatility. More zigs than zags. It could come back quickly and then it could go back down quickly. I think we're in for some few years of zigs and zags for Russia, Eastern Europe and so forth. So that's sort of a quadrant of, you know, tale of four different cities, I think in terms of how we are going to look at what's happening in the world.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company: Just a follow-up on the share repurchase question, Gary. Can you help us understand the $1.0 billion announcement today sort of in the context of obviously your balance sheet is still very healthy, generating a lot of cash. It seems like the billion could be read as a conservative number. In the past you've also talked about acquisition opportunity. Maybe help us flush out those issues.\nGary P. Fayard: There are a couple of things there and you've heard me talk about it in the past. One of the real items that you've got to consider are credit ratings and those are important to the system of maintaining those. We are very comfortable that with up to $1.0 billion in share repurchase that we maintain the credit ratings and where we are relative to all of the rating agencies. And we are being somewhat conservative but in the environment in which we're operating I think it's prudent to be conservative, and we will continue to update you on our plans of where we are relative to that as we go through the year. I think you saw us start the year being very conservative with not being in share repurchase at all. We're through half the year, we've announced we'll do up to $1.0 billion and then I'll just continue to update you as we go forward.\nMuhtar Kent: Just on that, we said to you in the last call that we would be looking at it as we approached the summer and as per what Gary said, we have looked at it and we believe that it's right to reinstitute it. And I think you will always be seeing us look proactively for bolt-on acquisitions as we go around the world. And in this environment we see increasing opportunities in that area. Just like the Innocent announcement.  But again, I reiterate, organic growth is the key to our success and the key to our business and I think that when you look at our volume results this past quarter, organic growth was strong. I mean, we had basically less than 0.5% of acquired volume in our numbers. And I'm pleased to see that as we go forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala \u2013 UBS.\nKaumil Gajrawala - UBS: You spoke a bit about 2020 Vision. Can you talk about as you went through studying 2020, how the conclusions might have varied from the manifesto? And specifically, are there some strategic tweaks that you might be making that we need to be thinking about?\nMuhtar Kent: It's an evolution coming and it's important that all our bottlers, we develop the 2020 Vision together with our bottling partners, that's perhaps one of the major differences as to how we saw the manifesto from the previous years. And I think importantly, we've added a sixth \"P\", which is productivity. It's embedded into everything we do. It's part of our transformation exercise and what we continue to want to do to even deliver even more than what we've said.  But I think it's a very sound 12-year vision with very specific strategic initiatives attached to it. It's a system document and we believe that we've put a stake in the ground in terms of where we want our system revenues to go from where they are today, from the base of around $90.0 billion today to where we want the system revenues to go to.  And we believe that it's a real road map and we are very actively, today as we speak, double-clicking that document into each geography and applying it to different geographies with all our bottling partners across the world. All our senior leaders, as Pancho is doing in Latin America, is generating Vision 2020 for each of the geographies, each of our 39 business units around the world.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Lauren Torres \u2013 HSBC.\nLauren Torres - HSBC: In the quarter in North America we saw retail volume down 4% with food service up 7%. I was curious to get your thoughts of what was behind these numbers. I guess being somewhat surprised to see food service doing so well. I was hoping you could talk about trends, be it by channel or by product category, for seeing some changes here.\nMuhtar Kent: We held our food service at 4% versus Q1 2009 in the United States in the second quarter. I am very pleased with the dynamics of our food service business and our retail business. As I said, we held the 4% in our retail business versus Q1. And I think that we are seeing some very good results of very good strategies being applied in our food service business. But I'm also very pleased with the developments that are taking place in terms of our brand, price, pack, channel architecture and working very closely with our bottling partners in the United States and what we're doing in our retail business.  And I think that what I'd like to say, I mentioned the ninety-nine cent single cold drink pack which is now in 90% of the United States generating incremental transactions every week. And that's proving very successful. But also the contourization of our 2-liter which is now in a quarter of the United States.  Our pricing is generating significant value share gains for us in the retail business. That's very positive compared to previous quarters. So we're holding volume at where it was and we're generating revenue growth, both for us and our bottling partners. That program is, we believe, sustainable and is getting good customer traction across the United States. And I think looking forward, we basically see sequential improvement from here on in our retail bottling-can business in the United States.\nLauren Torres - HSBC: And with that said, we're seeing sparkling beverages do better here in the U.S. so just curious could you talk on that and what's really driving that, how sustainable that is. How should we think about those trends as we course through the second half of the year?\nMuhtar Kent: As I've said, you should think of it as sequential improvement. We are pleased with the results of all the actions that we're taking. New package initiatives, new brand initiatives. Coca-Cola Zero driving growth. And the strength of our brands, the metric of our brands, with how our consumers see our brands getting better in the United States, which leads us to believe, again, that you will see sequential improvement in retail and in sparkling.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Christine Farkas - BAS-ML.\nChristine Farkas - BAS-ML: I have a global question, but just to clarify back on the North America top line, we saw net sales drop 3%, there was a negative point from currency, shipments were down 1%, which implies price mix was slightly negative. I just want to understand, given how strong the retail pricing environment was and your concentrate\u2014incidence phase, concentrate model, was this a channel shift switch or with fountain being so much stronger than retail, is that what impacted the price mix part of the top line?\nMuhtar Kent: I'll let Gary also reflect on this, but I think generally speaking what we see is a shift, some shift from cold drink due to the economy. So there is a shift in retail more to the home market, so cold drinks continues to be under pressure in North America and there's more movement to quick service in North America, some movement to quick service from bottling can cold drinks. You're seeing some of that being reflected in that number. And also the shift in general, as we said in terms of the pressure on pricing in North America. So I think overall, though, we are confident that our activity, all the actions that we're taking to drive sparkling, to drive cold drink with new price points, will bear fruit as we go into the second half of the year.\nChristine Farkas - BAS-ML: On the global question, you've noted certainly potential bumps along the way but your volume growth in the second quarter did pick up from the first quarter. When you look at the year here, is it fair to say that perhaps first quarter really was the bottom in terms of volumes or is there anything you can foresee that would suggest a hiccup like that in the second half of the year?\nMuhtar Kent: I can't say that with confidence, given where the economies are. All I can say is that all the programs that we have in place with our bottling partners are bearing fruit so what you've seen is improvements in key geographies compared to the second quarter of 2008, so you've got improvements in many geographies compared to the second quarter of last year.  And certainly sequential improvement in many, many geographies versus the first quarter, if you look at Europe, if you look at many parts of the world, in Eurasia and Africa, in the Pacific. You know, the Pacific group went from 4% to 6%. China went from 10% to 14%. Japan went from flat to 2%. So you've got sequential improvements from Q1 2009 to Q2 2009.  I think we are very pleased that we've been able to have a volume growth of 4% versus the 2% in the first quarter but certainly I think, and certainly we have comps of 5% in Q3 and 4% in Q4, so there are pretty significant comps as we go into the second half of the year, and we will continue to drive our business forward. Invest in our business and drive our business forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Damian Witkowski - Gabelli & Co.\nDamian Witkowski - Gabelli & Co.: On currencies, are you still actively hedging your Euro in the first half of 2009 even as the Euro was weak against the U.S. dollar? You mentioned you're proactively always looking for acquisitions. Is it more domestic or more international.\nGary P. Fayard: On currency, on the hard currencies, we do use an option strategy so that we participate on any appreciation of the currency, but to protect us against downside. And we do continue to do that even in the environment in which we're in on Euro, yen, All-C dollar, sterling, etc.\nMuhtar Kent: On acquisitions it's absolutely not focused on a single geography. At any point in time we are always talking with our group presidents around the world, like Pancho here, and all our other group presidents, about opportunities on a very, very regular basis. And then if we see any opportunities then our M&A team gets involved and we'll look at it very rapidly. So it's not related to a focus in North America or international per se. It's across the globe.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus & Company.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus & Company: A question on marketing spend per case globally. If we think about that number on a currency neutral basis, am I right in thinking that number was up in the quarter and can you tell us how much it was up, or at least tell us how it compared to rate of growth in the first quarter and in 2008?\nMuhtar Kent: Yes, I mean I think you see us continuing to drive efficiencies in our opex line and you see us continuing to invest. I've said before, there is no better time to invest in our brands than today. And we are trying to ensure that we manage this business on both a long-term basis and a short-term basis, on a quarterly basis.  But one of the key drivers of what we're doing every day is to make sure that we come out of this crisis stronger. Stronger with our brands, stronger with our system, than when we went into this crisis. We are driving efficiencies in media. So when you look at our spend, which was about even for Q2 in marketing, in 17 of our top 21 countries in the world, we drove efficiencies in marketing. That means our GRP costs were down and therefore look at our marketing spend with a view that there's tremendous pressure on pricing in terms of advertising.  So we're getting really good deals, in all markets. In Europe particularly, in Latin America Pancho has driven efficiencies together with Joe Tripoti, our chief marketing officer in media programs. So I think that's the way you should look at our media spend and our marketing spend.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus & Company: And what about impressions? What would you say rate of change on that is, given the efficiencies you are seeing.\nMuhtar Kent: I think our target is always to get more for our money and steadily build up our impressions.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus & Company: And is that happening?\nMuhtar Kent: Absolutely. And that's why you see our brand health improving around the world.\nOperator: Your final question comes from Ann Gurkin - Davenport & Co.\nAnn Gurkin - Davenport & Co.: First of all, we've heard some comments that perhaps consumption of soft drinks in the on-premise channel in China is slowing, so if you could comment on that. And then secondly, switching back to the U.S., any comment on the prospect for a tax on soft drinks and what is Coke doing and the industry doing to combat that?\nMuhtar Kent: On China, we haven't seen that happening. I think what you see is in China not a shift in channels but a shift in geographies. We have traditionally, you know, the stronger parts of China for our business have been the coast, have been the export-driven areas of China, and I think some of that dynamism of growth has shifted to the inland, as most consumers have moved in fairly large numbers. Millions and millions, tens of millions of consumers have shifted and moved back into the country into their home towns. But now, with the very effect of stimulus plan of China, those consumers have more money to spend and I think we're seeing a shift from the coast into more central and western cities, but not shift in channels. I think what you referenced as a possible tax issue around non-alcoholic beverages, and I think we're certainly doing our fair share to impress upon all parties concerned that this would not be the right move and that we have never seen a move like that work and we don't believe it will work this time and I think that as far as the Congress bill is concerned, there is no evidence of it in the Congress bill and we are waiting to see what happens in the Senate bill.\nMuhtar Kent: So with that, I would like to thank you all, thank Gary and Pancho and Jackson, as part of our continued efforts to provide you with a deep exposure across our business. I hope that you found the information that we've shared with you today valuable. I would like to say also that Abmet Bozer, our group president of our Eurasia and Africa group will be speaking on behalf of the company at the upcoming bottlers conference in early September.  As you can tell, all of us at the Coca-Cola company see tremendous opportunity and remain intently focused on our key strategic priorities to generate long-term sustainable growth. Our robust business model is built to withstand tough times. Great companies always plan with external trends in mind but do not over-react. While these trends help shape the future, the Coca-Cola system is creating its own future. And as we move through the halfway mark of 2009 we remain optimistic about our business and the future we are creating together with our system for long-term sustainable growth. Thanks for joining us this morning.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call."}, {"symbol": "KO", "quarter": 1, "year": 2009, "date": "2009-04-21 14:21:24", "content": "Executives: Jackson Kelly - Vice President and Director of Investor Relations Muhtar Kent - President and Chief Executive Officer Gary P.

Damien Witkowski - Gabelli & Company Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS \nOperator: Welcome everyone to The Coca-Cola Company first quarter 2009 earnings results conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce Mr. Jackson Kelly, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Kelly you may begin. \nJackson Kelly:  Good morning and thank you for being with us today. I am joined by Muhtar Kent, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Gary Fayard, our Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks this morning by Muhtar and Gary we will turn the call over to you for questions.  Before we get started I would like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report.   In addition, I would also like to note that we have posted schedules on our company website at www.thecoca-colacompany.com under the Financial Information tab in the Investor section which reconciles certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to by our senior executives in our discussion this morning and from time to time in discussing our financial performance as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. Please look on our website for this information.  I would now like to turn the call over to Muhtar Kent. \nMuhtar Kent: Thank you Jackson and good morning everyone. Before we get into an overview of our performance let me just say how humbled and honored I am to take on the additional role and responsibility of Chairman of the Board for our company. I am honored to succeed my good friend, Neville Isdell in this capacity. Future histories written about Coca-Cola will show that Neville helped lead our company out of some very tough times. His statesmanship and passion for improving the environmental, social and economic well being of our planet has been invaluable for everyone touched by our company, our system and our brand.  I am pleased to report another solid quarter of growth for The Coca-Cola Company despite severe global economic headwinds. We again exceeded our long-term profit targets, delivered volume growth in line with our expectations and executed on productivity initiatives ahead of schedule. Importantly, we delivered consistent and balanced top and bottom line performance results.  Globally, our unit case volume increased 2%, successfully cycling 6% growth in the first quarter of last year. Our international operations increased volume 3%, cycling 8%. These sound results reflect a company-wide disciplined focus on balancing the volume value equation to deliver consistent, quality revenue and operating income growth. We delivered quarterly revenue growth of 7% and operating profit growth of 17% on an ongoing currency basis. Our worldwide team continued to drive productivity initiatives and cost savings throughout the business, routinely adjusting and tweaking our actions to changing market conditions.  We remain well on track to deliver $500 million in annualized savings from these productivity initiatives by year-end 2011. The continued acceleration of these efforts is enabling our cash to be redeployed to drive investments for growth. As expected, global currency fluctuations negatively impacted results this quarter. We continue to monitor this activity and actively manage this risk where appropriate. As a reminder, we manage our global businesses in local currencies in order to make more effective decisions that deliver long-term, sustainable growth.  Our international markets remain significant contributors to our solid performance results. Our systems reach provides expanding opportunities to touch more and more customers every day and in turn create new revenue streams for our sparkling as well as still brands. The company achieved unit case volume growth across a diverse geographic footprint. Many key markets delivered at or above expectations this quarter with Mexico up 6% and Brazil growing 4%, both cycling 11% growth from prior year.  Northwest Europe was up 3% on strong performance in Great Britain. Also, Korea increased 5% as our new bottling partner continued to improve execution in the market place. We continue to gain strength in many emerging markets. In our 120 countries with per caps less than 150, our volume growth was 4% for the quarter cycling 10% in the prior year. India was up 31% and China up 10% both cycling double-digit growth. In Southeast Asia, Thailand was up 7% and Viet Nam up 8% while Nigeria was up 6% and Southern Eurasia 7%.  Importantly, our highly experience operating team continued to navigate current challenges by making well-focused, disciplined decisions geared towards further building our brand. The real strength of our franchise model is demonstrated in difficult times and we are working harder than ever to continue to bring value to our consumers and customers. All these efforts and opportunities are supported by a very strong balance sheet. This provides us the flexibility to leverage opportunities this environment may offer and to continue rewarding our shareholders with consistent dividend growth.  Unlike many companies that decided to cut dividends during this difficult period, we announced an 8% increase in dividends per share, the 47th consecutive annual increase. I am pleased to report that our system is more aligned than ever before. The franchise model in its broadest sense is still the best way to win in the market place. It gives us the focus we need, the global breadth and scale and the local leadership. Nothing is more important than exceeding our customer\u2019s expectations and sending our brand portfolio every single day in every single outlet.  We continue to work closely with our bottling partners to improve our capabilities, further strengthen our brands and leverage our significant marketing and distribution investments. We have established market presence far beyond our nearest competitor and we are in a uniquely strong position to drive continued solid growth. With a system that generates up to $50 million in cash every day, we will continue to invest in our system and make it stronger.  Together with our bottling partners and customers we remain committed to executing real equity building brand propositions to ensure we emerge from these difficult times even stronger. Simply said, as the world\u2019s leading beverage company we strive to create brand value through world-class integrated marketing, innovation and segmented execution with our customers. While our competitors may choose a different path through heavy price discounting and promotion, we do not believe this builds the enduring brand equity that sustains our business.  As we have said before, brand health and share gain will be key success metrics over the coming year. In fact, once again this quarter we gained non-alcoholic, ready to drink volume and value share, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of globally winning share in both. Despite tough market conditions, we continue to out perform the industry across most key categories and are aggressively looking for opportunities to profitably gain share from competitors. Our brand health scores which measures consumer favorite brands continue to improve as we invest in our consumer marketing and activate at the point of sale, always striving to create the perfect shopper experience outlet by outlet and market by market.  We firmly believe our business will continue to experience growth across all categories and all geographies. Current population and personal expenditure trends indicate that consumers will increasingly have the opportunity to pause of the simple moments of pleasure that we already provide nearly 1.6 billion times a day for cents at a time. The global economic crisis, while big in scale and scope, has certainly been less daunting for businesses like ours that provide affordable, high velocity products that are a staple in consumers\u2019 daily lives. For billions of consumers around the world, Coca-Cola and our other 500 brands remain an affordable luxury. This is a wonderful space to be in today and tomorrow.  In my recent travels around the world I have been encouraged by discussions I have had with leaders from various business and government sectors who all seem to be focused on incorporative, multi-lateral approaches to solving the global economic crisis. The recent G20 summit was certainly reflective of this move and we believe a harbinger of more positive actions to come.  For these and other reasons, we feel good about not only weathering this crisis but preparing ourselves to come out of it stronger and more nimble than ever. I am confident that our strong brands and solid business fundamentals will enable our management team to meet our long-term targets this year. Given the environment, however, there may be bumps along the way and we may experience some quarter-to-quarter volatility. We credit our continued solid results to a consistent set of strategic priorities and these priorities are the foundation of our sustainable growth.  First and foremost, we are focused on driving growth in sparkling and still beverages. Unit case volume for sparkling beverages which are the oxygen of our business was led by broad based international growth of 1%. Some highlights from sparkling beverage growth from around the world include Japan up 12%, India up 31%, Brazil up 3%, China 4%, Great Britain 9% and South Africa 2%.  Coca-Cola, the world\u2019s most valuable and loved brand, increased brand health scores in most of our key countries including the U.S. and we gained sparkling beverage share across most of our key global markets. Coke Zero continued its success increasing 14%. Sprite, now our third 2 billion unit case trademark, was driven by international growth of 5% led by China, India and Egypt.  On the marketing front our new Open Happiness campaign was launched. The campaign is successfully connecting the brand with key target audiences; teens and moms, driving recruitment and retention. As part of our fully integrated campaign we released our Open Happiness single on iTunes. This spirited and positive single has already reached over 400,000 plays on MySpace Music and made it into the top 40 on the iTunes Pop Chart.  Our stilled beverage case volume increased 9% as we focused on organic growth of our Mega brands and leveraged our recent strategic acquisitions. Internationally, stilled beverages were up 13%. We gained still beverage volume and value share globally driven by Vitaminwater and our global juice, tea, sports drinks and Energy brands. We remain the world\u2019s number one juice and juice drinks company and are gaining share with our key brands, Minute Maid Pulpy, Minute Maid Enhanced, Simply Orange and Jugos de Valle. Also, we recently announced an investment in Innocent, which is quickly becoming one of Britain\u2019s top brands by marketing its healthy ingredients and social commitment. While we are disappointed that we did not receive approval for the proposed Huiyuan acquisition, we remain firmly committed to our long-term growth model in China. We have made significant incremental investments in the past several years and remain focused on driving organic growth across our still brand portfolio.  Glaceau, led by Vitaminwater and Smart Water continued to gain value and market share as we introduced Vitaminwater 10, the first ingredient innovation behind this dynamic brand. We will expand Vitaminwater\u2019s footprint aggressively including launches in 10 more international markets this year bringing the total to 15.  Accelerating innovation is our second priority. We are applying new thinking to quickly and rapidly leverage our R&D investments across our global operations. For example, our breakthrough fountain dispensing technology which we highlighted at Cagney allows consumers to select from over 100 branded beverages. This product has entered into commercial testing in both Atlanta and Southern California. Our digital vending machine which marries sight, sound and refreshment at the point of sale and was first used at the Beijing Olympic Games can now be found at selected malls across the United States.  Our third priority is leveraging our geographic footprint. During the quarter we continued to perform well in Latin America with our strong franchise model delivering balanced growth as well as sparkling and still share gain. Coca-Cola increased 2% and still beverages increased 33% as we continued to integrate and expand the Jugos developed business. We remain optimistic about Latin America for the remainder of the year.  Japan held volume out performing the non-alcoholic beverage industry resulting in our fourth consecutive quarter of share gain. Our success in growing sparkling continues with trademark Coca-Cola 14% and Fanta up 16%. We expect to deliver consistent performance in this challenging climate and will continue to focus on our key mega brands in Japan including further strengthening Georgia coffee and returning Sokenbicha Aquarius to consistent growth.  The acquisition of a 50% stake in the TONE bottler will further improve our capabilities in the critical [Canto] region. Europe gained share in both sparkling and still categories and across key countries as the non-alcoholic beverage and drink industry slowed, especially in away from home channels and consumer confidence has been at historically low levels throughout the continent of Europe. That said, we remain focused on winning in the market place behind our key brands and are executing programs to leverage the current economic environment.  Strong performance in Great Britain was offset by Central and Eastern Europe where economies were impacted by severe currency devaluations. We continue to proactively navigate this environment using a number of Pan European initiatives. For example, we are communicating value propositions by integrating advertising, in-store and on pack messaging for both immediate and future consumption packages. This approach is working well in Italy and is now being carried to France and Spain.  We are also intensifying or promotional activity and in-store activation with new Coke and Meals programs. The aim here is to drive traffic and educate our customers on the Coke value proposition while maintaining margins. In particular we are using these tactics in Eastern Europe to address rapidly shifting consumer shopping behavior.  Finally, we are accelerating new product launches in many markets including new packaging for our successful Energy drinks and increasing multi-pack format more broadly across Europe. We expect the retail environment in Europe to remain challenging throughout 2009. Our European leadership team continues to proactively identify opportunities to capture share and maintain a strict focus on strengthening brand health in order to emerge in an even stronger position from this crisis.  In North America we again out performed the industry, gaining volume share for the fifth consecutive quarter and value share for the second consecutive quarter. Our determination to become the undisputed beverage leader drove gains in sparkling and still beverages led by our focus on juice, sports drinks and active lifestyle beverages as well as teas. We have a clear and aligned system strategy that is delivering sustainable growth and we are leading the industry in building value creating brands.  Effective marketing campaigns have led to across the board increases in brand health driven by the new Open Happiness consumer campaign for brand Coke, the NCAA Coke Zero March Madness activation and the Diet Coke Hard Truth integrated marketing program. In addition, our still brands continue to lead the industry in overall growth for the seventh consecutive quarter driven by a robust pipeline of innovation. We continue to see strong performance from PowerAde, Gold Peak Tea and Minute Maid Enhanced as well as Simply Chilled juices which are fielding leadership growth in the category.  Glaceau brands continued to gain share and we expect growth from this business for the remainder of 2009 as we leverage our new innovation and execute strong marketing programs. Our alignment with our North American bottling partners continues to strength and we have already progressed the strategy that we put into place almost two years ago. Importantly, a number of strategic priorities that are designed to reshape the system\u2019s future are delivering tangible results.  The $0.99 entry package now available at over 60% of the U.S. is driving significantly more transactions and retailer dollar sales while gaining share. We are also driving positive mix benefits in future consumption packages for our bottlers and customers. Also, our all-important test for contour 2 liter packaging is being expanded across the Southeast and initial reads are very positive.  The Coca-Cola Supply Company is up and running, focusing initially in freight and logistics and we expect to exceed year-one targets. We are excited about our strategy for North America and we are confident that we will return the business to growth while driving long-term profitability for our customers and for our system.  Our picture of success this year remains clear. Number one; maintain focus on a consistent set of strategies with measurable deliverables. Second, increase the speed and efficiency of execution to capitalize on opportunities while mitigating risk. Third, remain constructively discontent in all that we do in order to deliver against our long-term growth targets and enhance our long-term brand and system health.  I am pleased with the results we have delivered in the first quarter. We are performing with great resolve in this time of uncertainty and believe that we will come out of this period a much better company and system than when we entered it. We remain relentlessly focused on effectively operating for the long-term in the best consumer business in the world.  With that let me turn the call over to Gary. \nGary Fayard:  Thanks Muhtar. Good morning everyone. As Muhtar indicated, the fundamentals of our business remain strong. We continued to gain share and enhance brand health. We are sustaining and improving our operational and financial discipline while building on our firm foundation using consistent, strategic priorities.  Our volume growth results were in line with our expectations and there was growth across a diverse geographic footprint. We delivered ahead of our long-term currency neutral profit target, increasing operating income 17%, cycling 8% last year. Reported operating income declined 1% primarily related to the 17% currency headwind. We again delivered significant operating expense leverage in the quarter. This was driven by our continued focus on productivity, disciplined cost management and the benefit of revenue generated by the five additional selling days without significant corresponding operating expenses, all of which more than offset higher pension expense that we noted last quarter.  Looking at SG&A we continued to invest solidly behind our brands, principally reinvesting savings to increase our share voice and build brands across integrated marketing initiatives. As outlined in our release, we reported earnings per share of $0.58 on a diluted basis for the first quarter. As expected this included charges relating to our restructuring of the German bottling operations and ongoing productivity initiatives at both the company and our equity investee bottlers.  In total, we had a net charge of $0.07 per share in the quarter. Therefore our adjusted EPS was $0.65 per share, a decrease of 3% after considering items impacting comparability in both the current and prior year and again significantly impacted by currency. Our results were impacted by the five additional selling days we had this quarter versus the prior year. This will reverse in the fourth quarter which will have six fewer selling days as compared to last year.  We estimate that even without the five extra selling days we would have delivered currency neutral operating profit essentially at the high end of our long-term growth targets. Net revenue in the quarter decreased 3% which included a negative 10% impact from currency and a 2% drag from structural changes primarily related to our divestment of certain bottlers. At the same time, net revenues were positively impacted by a 7% increase in concentrate sales, partially reflecting the five extra selling days in the quarter and a 2% increase from price and mix.  Now let me move to currency. As I mentioned earlier we saw a significant impact from currency in the first quarter. In fact, the 17% headwind was higher than what we had anticipated at our last earnings call in February. Despite some recent improvement, the dollar continued to strengthen significantly against many of the emerging market currencies following our call, increasing our unfavorable translation exposure.  Specifically, as we look to the second quarter we will begin to cycle the height of the Euro\u2019s strength last summer which is more favorable than our current hedged rates. Therefore, based on current expectations including the rates we are cycling and hedges in place for our key hard currencies we anticipate a 14-16% currency headwind for the second quarter. However, we are all observing the continued evolution of the market\u2019s risk perspectives which may move to mute the attractiveness of the dollar as the year progresses. There are many different scenarios that could play out and I can assure you we are carefully managing our risk and the corresponding opportunity.  As Muhtar mentioned, we manage our business in local currency to ensure our operating management always makes the right investment decisions for the long-term health of the business.  Now let me address some of the factors that we see impacting the remainder of this year and specifically the second quarter. Our picture of success for 2009 remains to meet our long-term currency neutral profit growth targets. For the first half of 2009 we would expect to deliver in line with those targets. Based on our strong first quarter results this implies a second quarter will be below our profit targets due to the timing of concentrate sales, higher pension costs and cycling lower incentive compensation costs in North America.  Finally, we do not expect to drive additional leverage below operating income due to the full impact of higher interest costs related to the $2.25 billion in term debt we placed in March and the continued impact of currency on equity income from our bottler investees. Let me reiterate though we are confident in meeting our long-term targets for the year.  We continue to have discussions with our board about uses of cash. We are taking into consideration a number of factors including the implications of the current global economic environment and ensuring we maintain our financial flexibility. We are considering options that will enable us to continue to pursue opportunities such as Innocent that may arise and/or reinstitute our share repurchase program. We will keep you updated as we continue through the year.  Before I move to taxes let me remind you of one last modeling point. As in the first quarter our revenues will continue to be impacted due to structural changes primarily related to the disposal of bottlers. We would expect a similar drag as we cycle the sale of the Remil bottler in Brazil at the end of Q2 and the Pakistan bottler investment at the end of Q3.  Finally, on taxes, we ended the quarter with an underlying effective tax rate of 23.5% and we estimate our underlying effective rate will remain in the range of 23.5% for the remainder of the year. I know the current U.S. budget proposal to substantially increase the taxation of income earned outside of the U.S. is top of mind for many of you. However, it is too early to estimate any potential impacts as the budget details have yet to be released. We are working alongside other multi-national companies to inform the administration and Congress as to the negative impact any such change on the competitive of U.S. multi-national companies and the impact on U.S. jobs.  So we are off to a good start in 2009. We recognize there may be some ups and downs over the course of the year given the macro environment. However, we feel real opportunity to leverage this environment and drive our business for the long-term and build on our track record of success. Our seasoned management team remains committed to delivering profit targets while driving share gains and further enhancing the health of our brands. We have a clear picture of success and believe we have a skilled management team with the right plans and the right capabilities to achieve our goals.  Operator, we are ready for any questions. \n :\nOperator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of John Faucher - J.P. Morgan. \nJohn Faucher - J.P. Morgan:  On PepsiCo\u2019s announcement yesterday about purchasing PAS and PBG. Obviously you have had this hospital ward policy for the past 4-5 years. Can you talk about any thoughts you have about what PepsiCo is trying to do, how it affects you competitively realizing that it is fairly short notice here? Looking out do you feel you need to make any changes to the hospital ward policy in terms of maybe holding on to some of these bottlers longer? Even consolidating the U.S.?\nMuhtar Kent :  I will not comment on any one other than what we are trying to do. What I would like to say here is I believe the question you are really asking is do we believe we have the right system structure, particularly in North America. As I said earlier, fundamentally we believe the franchise model is the best way to win in the market place. We are pleased with the positive forward momentum we are generating here in North America and the spirit of collaboration with our bottlers not just here in North America but across the whole world has never been better. We are aligned with all our bottling partners to take cost out of the system, reshape our brand, price and back channel architecture. Here in North America that is beginning to yield results. This is not something that we have just been doing in the last few months. We have been at this for the last two years working very hard with CCE\u2019s leadership.  In fact, some of the things that were announced yesterday we are taking cost savings already, significant cost savings, out of our key initiatives with our principle bottling partners here in North America. The Supply Chain company is up and running. I think you heard before in calls that is going to generate over $150 million of synergies for our system and that now basically bottlers representing almost 90% of our business in the U.S. are participating in this initiative. The incidence based model that again almost 90% of our bottlers are participating, 85+% is yielding very good results, eliminating duplication.  The Fountain Harmony and outlet service solution initiative that we have embarked upon with again Coca-Cola Enterprises leadership are yielding results. They will generate an additional $50-75 million of synergies that again you have heard about before. So I think what I would like to just reiterate is that correcting a systemic issue does not happen over night. It starts with a sound, long-term strategic focus aligning with bottlers on the picture of success and as I said we have been working on this for the last two years. Our new initiatives are yielding good results in the market place. We feel that all our bottlers are executing with much more precision, much more passion and we are just beginning now to see the results and we feel confident that the localized approach of bottling coupled with our global reach and our harmonious marketing programs are yielding very good results for us. \nJohn Faucher - J.P. Morgan: If I could ask just one quick follow-up on that then, you talked about the new incidence based pricing model in the U.S. working. Should we expect to see that extended over the next couple of years? \nMuhtar Kent :  Extended to where? \nJohn Faucher - J.P. Morgan: From a time standpoint. My understanding is it is not necessarily something that is\u2026\nMuhtar Kent :  If something is working, there is absolutely no reason not to assume that it would not be extended. It is working. I reiterate it is working. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Bill Pecoriello \u2013 Consumer Edge. \nBill Pecoriello \u2013 Consumer Edge: I wanted to follow-up just on North America. You have made it clear that you have your strategy and your game plan on how to win in the market but if PepsiCo is able to be more flexible in route to market, if they take Gatorade pricing down which could have implications for Vitaminwater and have a large savings pool to reinvest, are there things you can do in terms of accelerating that $150 million supply chain and other actions you can take with your strategy to make sure you remain competitive while they go through and have this big savings pool to reinvest back in? \nMuhtar Kent :  As I said, in answer to John\u2019s question, we will do everything to ensure that our strategy works, our strategy wins, creates wins for our bottling partners, principally for our customers and ensures we are able to deliver the best brands to our consumers through the most effective production and distribution system and sales system in North America. We will ensure that we apply our leadership thinking to that. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Christine Farkas \u2013 Merrill Lynch. \nChristine Farkas \u2013 Merrill Lynch: I wanted to follow-up on North America specifically we saw very good food service trends up 3% in food service in fountain. I\u2019m wondering if you can clarify really where that traffic came from. Is that QSR related? Then on the same line, the retail volume still being down what is your outlook for pricing as we go into the summer months? Just broad picture along with some packaging innovation that you put into the market place and comment on how Monster has potentially contributed in your first quarter both here and abroad. \nMuhtar Kent :  Starting with Food Service, all I can tell you is that we have great programs working with our food service customers extending our portfolio, category extension, smoothies, teas are really working very well for us and also our new cup programs are generating very good traffic results for us as well as incident increases in QSR. So it is primarily driven by QSR and of course most of our customer base is actually doing well in this environment and I think we hope we are contributing somewhat to those results for our customers and we are getting the benefit also with the extension of categories and our marketing programs working effectively. I do believe that perhaps the QSR is getting some benefit although still to be verified from the lower gas prices.  So that is our food service. Next, in terms of the pricing as we go into the quarter I think don\u2019t think of pricing as a certain price of a certain pack. I think you need to think of it as basically mix management. We are seeing some great results from our new packaging initiatives, particularly on immediate consumption and I think that also we are driving principally value share up in our business and I think you will see us continue to drive value shares throughout the summer with effective mix management both in future consumption channels as well as immediate consumption channels.  Then I think the last question you had was on Monster. I think it is early days to talk about Monster. It is just coming to our system. Initial reads on Monster are positive both here in North America as well as what is happening in Northwest Europe. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Carlos Laboy - Credit Suisse. \nCarlos Laboy - Credit Suisse: Can you revisit for us your view of your soft drink integration, whether it is evolving as ABI encroaches on more of your bottling owners that happen to have beer? The reason I am asking the question in part is some of your bottler brewers have been increasing your discourse on the need for the integration of beer and soft drinks. \nMuhtar Kent :  My view of soft drink integration has not changed since the day that I was managing a brewer and a bottling business. That is that strategic functions need to be separated and if there are synergies in non-strategic areas like freight, like warehousing, like back office I think that in this day and age you cannot leave those on the table. You have got to take advantage of those. But at the front end, which is you are talking about a different consumer, a different consumption habit; I think it is absolutely important to keep the strategic functions dedicated to each side. That is basically my view on that. I think you have heard me say that before. \nCarlos Laboy - Credit Suisse: Do you see low hanging fruit within the scope of what you are willing to accept still out there to be grabbed and do you see an opportunity for that to accelerate volume growth for soft drinks? \nMuhtar Kent :  Providing that they are inside that corridor that I have talked about, yes. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: I was hoping to get a little more granularity on your currency view for 2009. I presume you are still 100% covered on the Euro and the Yen. Can you give us some more detail on coverage for other hard currencies including the Pound? \nGary Fayard:  We are essentially covered on Euro and Yen. We also do have coverage on Sterling and we would also have some coverage on the Canadian dollar and Aussie dollar. What you are seeing is a combination of several different factors. Number one, going into the second quarter obviously our coverage which we normally put on at the end of a year is significantly lower than what we are cycling which was the height of the strength of the Euro last year when it got up to $1.55 or $1.57 something like that to the dollar. So that is what we are going to see in the second quarter. The other piece is the emerging markets where it is really too expensive to put much hedge coverage on. In those emerging markets we saw them tank overall in the first quarter. We have seen some of them come back. If you look at the Peso it went from 10-1/2 last year. It got over 15 or like 15.2 early this year. It came back down to about 13 and now it is about 13.5 in the last couple of days.  So a lot of those emerging market currencies while they really devalued significantly they are starting to come back some but now we are having to cycle the strengthened Euro. They are coming back some but nowhere near where they were a year ago. With that said, we believe over time and the question is when, the dollar will have to reverse course with the kind of deficit the U.S. government is running the dollar has to reverse. The question is when and a lot of that is the risk aversion in the markets obviously and you saw some of that happen yesterday as the dollar strengthened again and as gold went up again.  Let me assure you, we are watching it closely. The first quarter was obviously worse than we thought it was going to be in that 10-12 and what I would tell you is that in the first quarter in fact if you took the top ten currencies, everything else, the ones you never even think about, everything else was probably 1/3 of what we saw happen. That is where some of that negative surprise came from. We are watching it. We are watching it closely and I think we have got a pretty good handle on it. Although none of us like it that is kind of where it is today. \nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: One technical thing, on the Pound and the Canadian dollar were you saying that you are fully covered for those for the balance of the year or were you saying partially covered? \nGary Fayard:  Partially covered. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Lauren Torres \u2013 HSBC. \nLauren Torres - HSBC: I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your effort to stabilize your markets, particularly Central and Eastern Europe. I\u2019m curious to get your thoughts on these markets, particularly Russia. Have you seen any signs of improvement or at least stabilization and once again if you can just talk about efforts there to sort of rebuild to what you previously had. That would be helpful. \nMuhtar Kent :  I think certainly Russia has been very hard hit by the current crisis. Not too dissimilar to the consumer sentiment that we saw in August 1998 in that crisis. Of course now on a much bigger scale because in 1998 there was maybe one million people qualified to be middle class consumers. In Russia today there are more than 20 million. Therefore it is impacting it in a much bigger way. Certainly new price points shifting to affordable packages and also focusing very much again on the customer in terms of our marketing strategy. We are fully aligned again with Coca-Cola Hellenic in terms of how to come out of this crisis. I think that 2009 certainly, the first half of 2009 certainly will be the worst part of the crisis as far as we can tell. We are gaining share. I think that is important in all categories particularly in the still beverage category in Russia. \nLauren Torres - HSBC: If I could just ask a quick question to Gary. I\u2019m just curious why at this point why you are not reinstating your share repurchase program? I know it was expended as a result of the acquisition in China. Now that is off the table why aren\u2019t you reinstating it at this point? \nGary Fayard:  It is something that we will actually be discussing with our Board. We have our Board meeting later this week. At the same time, I think it is a combination of things. Don\u2019t worry. It is not lost on us that the after tax cost of borrowing would be cheaper than the dividend, so I get it on share repurchase. But I also recognize that in these kinds of times, these macro economic conditions, you want to continue to have a very strong balance sheet, you want to have financial flexibility. We are seeing some, albeit small, but we are seeing opportunities like the Innocent deal where if I take Innocent as an example 18 months ago we knew it was a great brand. 18 months ago we called on them and they wouldn\u2019t even talk to us. Today we are a strategic investor alongside Innocent management. There are going to be some opportunities. Our goal with this is to come out much stronger. We are going to reinvest in the business and then we have always viewed share repurchase as a residual if there are not reinvestment opportunities to drive the long-term value for our shareholders for the business results, then we would look at share repurchase.  It is on the table. It is something we are looking at and it is something we will keep you appraised of as we go through the year. \nMuhtar Kent :  Just let me add one thing to that. Our principle focus is to grow our top line effectively in every environment, hard or good. I think you see us focused on that. You are not hearing us saying we won\u2019t do it. We are just not committing to it. As Gary said, we will be talking about it with our Board actively and then you will hear back from us. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Celso Sanchez \u2013 Citigroup. \nCelso Sanchez \u2013 Citigroup: Just a bit of an update, you gave us a bit of one on the North American business a few minutes ago. I think you talked about the Incidence roll out, 85% plus. I guess the first part of my question is was that intended to go towards 100% or were you comfortable with where it is now? Then on the fountain business if you can give us an update. I think last quarter you talked about 20% dual customer model in with CCE and that you were moving to a single model. Can you just update us on how that is progressing? That sounds like you are pleased with the progress but a number would be helpful. \nMuhtar Kent :  I think today our incidence based concentrate pricing model covers almost 85+% of our bottling business in the United States. I think it is working well. It is eliminating basically unnecessary energy that goes into the discussions and focuses all our energy jointly on the market place and on the customer. It has worked well. I think that is already a very good percent of our bottling network that is engaged in this effort of incidence based concentrate pricing. So I think we will just evolve it along the way. Certainly the early signs of it in implementation are very positive with all our bottling partners that are participating in that. \nCelso Sanchez \u2013 Citigroup: Is 100% the target? \nMuhtar Kent :  I think that certainly what we see is that we have got very good coverage very quickly and basically the rest of the bottling partners in the United States are old contracts. So I think you would assume where we are is a very good number. \nCelso Sanchez \u2013 Citigroup: The fountain please? \nMuhtar Kent :  On fountain it is clearly one of the important initiatives. Fountain Harmony and we have dual customer calling as you said in 20% of CCE territory and we have begun to move to a single call model in one market to improved value to our customer assistance. It is still in the early stages. You can call it an active commercial test and as we progress it we will take it and expand it to other territories. \nCelso Sanchez \u2013 Citigroup: Is there a timeline targeted for the phasing of that? \nMuhtar Kent :  We have said that growth from output service solutions in Fountain Harmony the objective is for our system between CCE and us to generate between $50-75 million of synergies and we will be on target to ensure we create that between now and 2011. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: Can you just talk about China in the quarter? 10% volume growth is still pretty healthy but saw a sequential slow down from the fourth quarter that was up 29% or so. If you can just talk about what you are seeing in that market. Pepsi talked about yesterday some of the regional differences. If you can give us a little bit more color there that would be great. \nMuhtar Kent :  Certainly with what is happening in China we are happy and content with double-digit growth, cycling 20% the prior year. The slower growth is Chinese New Year timing and certainly there is a slowing in the economy. We have continued to gain sparkling and still beverage volume and value share in the quarter and we continue to invest for the long-term in the market place. As I said we have announced a $2 billion investment program over the next three years. That is on target. We are getting balanced growth across the portfolio. Still beverages were up 28%, a very healthy 28% and our sparkling beverages were in mid single digits. \nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: Gary, in North America in the first quarter huge margin expansion that you saw can you just maybe help us understand what drove that? \nGary Fayard:  Yes, it is really a combination of two things. One is the five extra days. Remember that proportionately North America is heavier in finished products than most of our other operating groups. With those five days you would see a lot more margin flowing through from that. The second thing I would point out here there is some timing in some SG&A items that will reverse in the second quarter. So that is part of what I was talking about on the second quarter as well. So, it is an anomaly in the quarter. They had very good results particularly compared to the way the U.S. market performed, gaining share, but I would say you should look at North America probably over the first half as we get through the second quarter. \nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: Just to follow-up on currency can you give us the full year impact at this point? The 14-16 points sounds like it was just more of a second quarter. If you can give us\u2026\nGary Fayard:  The 14-16 is definitely a second quarter and let me be the first to say I said 10-12 and it ended up 17. That was a week later. It moved that much on me from our second quarter call, and a week later I realized it had jumped significantly. I don\u2019t think anyone can tell you what currency is going to be for the full year. The rates moved significantly yesterday. We saw the Euro which had been really weak over the last month or so really start strengthening, getting up to $1.32 or $1.34 and now it is back to $1.29 yesterday. So it is anybody\u2019s guess. I wouldn\u2019t take anybody\u2019s forecast today to tell you the truth. I think a quarter is about as far as you can go in this volatility. \nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: Just to clarify, it is all translational. There is nothing in terms of your cost structure that in some of these emerging markets where your local costs are more in U.S. dollars versus your local revenues? \nGary Fayard:  It is primarily all translational. There is some transactional but very small amounts. It would be where we have got expatriate employees that are paid in dollars but that is minor. Some of the ingredients cost are dollar based. So there is some of it but not that much. It is primarily just all from translation. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Damien Witkowski - Gabelli & Company. \nDamien Witkowski - Gabelli & Company: Just a quick question following up on China. Are you seeing currently or are you anticipating any issues with new manufacturing capacity coming on line? Meaning, getting permits, etc. in China? \nMuhtar Kent :  No. We don\u2019t see any issues around that. In fact, this year very soon I will be in China again opening two brand new bottling plants coming on stream. I don\u2019t see any issues and I think that our bottlers\u2019 appetites for continuing to invest ahead of the curve and ensuring that we can have the capacity for both our still beverage footprint that is growing very rapidly and ensuring that we have the right infrastructure for producing all our beverages. The bottlers\u2019 appetite is there to continue staying ahead of the curve. \nDamien Witkowski - Gabelli & Company: On Eastern Europe going back to the comments you made earlier, you said it was a rapidly shifting change in consumer behavior. I\u2019m wondering if you are talking about channel shift. Are they shopping at different places or is it they are just shopping less? \nMuhtar Kent :  I think they are shopping less and they are shopping differently. Both. Shopping less, the traffic in kiosks, markets or malls are less and people are spending a lot more time at home which is really not too different a phenomenon across the western markets either. Certainly it is I think deeper in Eastern Europe right now whether you are talking about Hungary, Czech Republic or you are talking about Russia or Romania. So what we have are lots of value creating promotions, transactional promotions at the point of sale and offering more value to consumers, linking up with more entertainment at home and home deliveries, etc. We are doing a lot of programs, shifting a lot of programs to ensure we can keep up and be ahead of consumer\u2019s changing behaviors in Eastern Europe. Again, it is taking awhile for us to see those results but we feel pretty confident that the deepness of the curve is going to even out as we move into the second half of the year. \nOperator:  The final question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala \u2013 UBS. \nKaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Two regions that look like they stand out in terms of your performance versus the category are Latin America and Northwestern Europe. Can you provide us some insight on whether there is anything specific going on there? Particularly as it relates to Western Europe and how sustainable the current growth rates are. Then lastly, just to be clear on the buyback, I understand your reservations but is the bottom line that you just have not yet met with the Board? \nGary Fayard:  Why don\u2019t I take that one first on share repurchase. The board meeting specifically is on Thursday of this week. We will be talking with them about our plans but again we are maintaining flexibility and keeping our options open. So we could re-enter share repurchase. If we do we will notify you and let you know. Probably on the next quarter call but again keeping financial flexibility because there are a lot of opportunities in this environment as well. \nKaumil Gajrawala - UBS: The other question? \nMuhtar Kent :  On Europe, it is not a uniform picture. Eastern Europe we just talked about. As far as Western Europe is concerned, we see again good momentum in Northwest Europe and in South Europe the crisis came earlier and we are certainly seeing the effect of that and also Germany in terms of price deflation and consumer sentiment is negative. I would say we are basically number one. Gaining share, very importantly. We are focused on our execution of our strategies, expanding our still beverage footprint. We are gaining still beverage volume and value share in the quarter in Europe. Still beverages were up 4% for the quarter. Juices, teas, sports drinks, water in terms of our still beverage portfolio and we are seeing a strong discounter presence and we are expanding our presence in hard discounters across Europe. So that is our strategy and we believe that certainly we will come out much stronger with both our brand health as well as our share in Europe.  In Latin America, we have got tremendous bottle alignment and as I said in my remarks we feel confident we will continue our momentum in both sparkling and still beverages in Latin America.  What I would like to just say now is our focus in this challenging and dynamic environment is to proactively and successfully drive our strategic agenda. Our robust business model is built to withstand tough times and we remain confident that we have the right strategies, have the right plan and leadership team to do just that. In 2009 we will continue to do what we have done in the past 123 years; remain resolute in creating sustainable growth and value for our shareholders.  Thanks for joining us this morning. We wish you all a great day. \nOperator:  Thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call with The Coca-Cola Company.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Jason (sic) [Jackson] Kelly, Vice President and Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Kelly, you may begin.\nJackson Kelly: Good morning, and thank you for being with us today. I'm joined by Muhtar Kent, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Fayard, our Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions.  Before we begin, I would like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objective, and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report. In addition, I would also like to note that we have posted schedules on our company website at www.thecocacolacompany.com, under the Reports and Financial Information tab in the Investors section, which reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to by our senior executives in our discussion this morning and from time to time in our discussing our financial performance to our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Please look on our website for this information. Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that once again, the Coca-Cola Company delivered strong results this quarter and ended 2010 having realized another year of solid growth and success.  In 2010, we met or exceeded all of our long-term growth targets. And we achieved these results against a backdrop of an unbalanced global economic recovery and while completing our acquisition of CCE's North America business.  At the same time, we once more gained volume and value share in Global non-alcoholic beverages. We also gained global volume in both the sparkling and still ready-to-drink beverage categories. Together, with our global bottling partners, we are decisively executing our 2020 Vision and are advancing our momentum. Our brands are stronger and healthier, fueled dynamically by our marketing and innovation. Brand Coca-Cola, the very oxygen of our business, grew 4% for both the quarter and the full year, the highest full year growth our wonderful flagship brand has achieved in over a decade. Our investments are rising as we keenly focused on expanding our profitable operations in a sustainable way across more than 200 markets where we do business today.  Our business in North America is growing again. We delivered positive organic volume growth for the full year in North America. This complements the rapid and successful work we're doing to integrate our North America business, all designed to bring greater growth, profitability and value to our flagship market. And today, our system is more aligned than it has been in a decade. In 2010, the first year of our 2020 Vision, we executed and performed as one closely coordinated global system. No question, the journey to our 2020 Vision is underway. Turning now to our performance results. I'm happy to report that our volume growth grew a strong 6% in the quarter. Excluding the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands, primarily Dr. Pepper brands in North America, our quarterly volume growth was a strong 5%. This was fueled by organic volume growth in every one of our five geographic operating groups.  As for the full year, we also grew our global volume 5%, again ahead of our long-term growth target and delivered over $1 billion unit cases of incremental organic volume growth. That is more than the equivalent of adding another Japan to our business. We increased fourth quarter net revenues 45% on a comparable currency neutral basis. For the full year, we grew comparable currency neutral net revenues 14% in line with our long-term growth target, even after excluding the benefit of structural changes, principally due to the CCE transaction and the benefit of new cross-licensed brand.  This quarter, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.72, up 9% versus the prior year and at the high end of our long-term growth target. On a full year basis, we delivered comparable earnings per share growth of 14%, well ahead of our long-term growth target. And our fourth quarter comparable currency neutral operating income growth was 10%. This brings our full year comparable currency neutral operating income to 11%, also above our long-term growth target. In fact, this is the fifth consecutive year we have either met or exceeded our long-term profit growth target. These strong fourth quarter and full year 2010 performance results further strengthened the foundation of our business and provide us with great momentum as we embark on 2011, the second year of our journey to 2020. Now let's review our performance results across our global markets in more detail beginning with North America, our flagship market. North America volume was up 8% this quarter, with organic volume growth of 3%, excluding the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands. This was North America's third consecutive quarter of positive organic growth. On a full year basis, our North America volume was up 2% and organic volume was up 1%, excluding again the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands.  The same time, this past quarter, we completed the acquisition of CCE's North America business on plan and on schedule. Today, we're very pleased to report that our new operating structure and our leadership teams are well in place, and that our integration efforts are proceeding exactly as planned. Sparkling beverages in North America, excluding the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands, were up 1% in the quarter and even for the full year. Including the benefit of our cross-licensed brands, North America sparkling beverages were up 8% for the quarter and 1% for the full year. Importantly, North America grew sparkling volume and value share for the quarter and full year versus the total category, as well as versus our primary competitor. Trademark Coca-Cola in North America was up 1% in the quarter, led by Coke Zero, which delivered double-digit volume growth for the 19th consecutive quarter. Sprite had a third consecutive quarter of positive growth up 4% for the quarter and 2% for the full year. Fanta also delivered positive growth for the quarter and the full year. We also extended the footprint of our innovative Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispensers. This game-changing innovation is now available in more than 400 locations across 20 U.S. markets, providing a greater choice of brands to our customers and our consumers. Plans for further expansion in 2011 are well on track with availability expected to reach more than 80 U.S. markets by the end of 2011. All of these developments reaffirm the fact that our system is executing the right strategies to sustainably drive growth across our entire North America sparkling beverage portfolio. Turning to North America still beverages. I'm pleased to report a strong 7% increase for the quarter and 5% growth for the full year. We have now grown volume share for our still beverages for 12 of the past 14 quarters and value share for 13 of the last 14 quarters. Our North America Juices and Juice Drink business delivered positive full year growth of 2%. This was fueled by our Simply brand up double-digits for the full year.  In the North America Tea category, we saw 11% growth in the quarter and 12% for the full year, led by Gold Peak, which more than doubled its volume in 2010. Our glac\u00e9au brands grew 19% in the quarter, and our vitaminwater trademark growth up double digits was led by the further expansion of vitaminwater zero. In addition, smartwater delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth. POWERade was up a solid 20% in the quarter, outperforming the North America's sports drinks category and gaining share versus our primary competitor for the ninth consecutive quarter. For the full year, POWERade delivered strong 19% growth, including over 60% full year growth for POWERade Zero, our innovative zero calories sports drink. These strong results in North America are a testament to our long-held belief that through strong marketing and focused execution, we can accelerate our leadership position within North America and drive profitable and sustainable growth in our flagship market. Now let me turn to Eurasia and Africa. This operating group saw broad-based growth, up 14% in the fourth quarter and 12% for the full year. Once again, all nine business units in this operating group delivered positive volume growth. Importantly, brand Coca-Cola was up 12% for the quarter and up 10% for the full year, benefiting from our strategic investments across the entire region. This strong performance in Eurasia and Africa was led by Russia, up 31% this quarter and finishing the full year up 16%. We once again outperformed the market in Russia this quarter, led by the continued strong performance of our core sparkling brands. Brand Coca-Cola in Russia was up 37%, for the quarter and up 26% for the full year. This performance represents the largest ever single-year incremental volume growth for brand Coca-Cola in Russia. It is no surprise therefore that Coca-Cola was recently awarded the Best Soft Drink of the Year at Russia's Brand of the Year Award ceremony. As such, we believe we are ideally positioned to outperform our primary international competitor in Russia.  India, meanwhile, returned to double-digit growth, up 12% in the fourth quarter and 17% on a full year basis. This market has now achieved double-digit growth in nine of the last quarters. And India captured share growth across our sparkling and still portfolio in both the quarter and on a full year basis. This shows, demonstrates that India is delivering high-quality growth consistently across our entire portfolio rather than relying on select growth from any single category. Sparkling beverage growth in India was led by trademark Coca-Cola and trademark Sprite, both up double digits in the quarter and for the full year. In fact, our brands now represents four of the top five sparkling brands in India. And our still beverage growth in India benefited from the further expansion of our Maaza juice brand, up double digits in the quarter and for the full year. We also grew double digits in both the quarter and the full year in Turkey, Southern Eurasia and the Middle East. As for performance in Africa, South Africa delivered 8% unit case volume growth for the quarter and 5% for the full year, building on our momentum coming out of last summer's FIFA World Cup activation program, as well as our ongoing in-market investments. We also saw double-digit growth in East and Central Africa and high single-digit growth in North and West Africa, providing a very strong and consistent finish to our full year performance throughout the African continent. Moving to our Pacific Group, overall volume growth was up 1% in the fourth quarter, cycling 11% from the previous year, bringing our full year volume growth to 6%. These results were driven by a second consecutive quarter of positive growth for Japan, which was up 2% for the quarter and 3% for the full year. This growth in Japan was widespread across our beverage portfolio. Leading the way was Coca-Cola trademark, up 5% in Japan this quarter, a fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth. On a full year basis, Coca-Cola trademark was also up 5%, making this the fourth consecutive year Coca-Cola trademark has grown 3% or more in Japan. We are encouraged by the recent momentum in this highly profitable developed market. But having said that, we remain cautious about the current and ongoing economic challenges in Japan. Turning to China. Our full year volume grew 6%, with fourth quarter volume down 3%. You will recall this quarter that we are cycling 29% volume growth from the prior year. As we indicated in our first quarter 2010 earnings call, it is not uncommon to see quarter-to-quarter volume swings in China. This is especially true between the fourth quarter and the first quarter of every year, given that fluctuating end of year trading activity, driven by the very timing of Chinese New Year. That said, our Sparkling Beverages and Juice and Juice Drinks captured volume and value share in China in the fourth quarter. For the full year, 2010, we grew our business in China by over $100 million incremental unit cases, our seventh consecutive year of achieving this level of incremental unit case growth. And cumulatively over the last two years, we've expanded our volume in China by 24%, significantly widening the gap with our primary international competitor. Over the same two-year time period, our compounded annual growth rate in China was 11%, in line with our long term double-digit growth objectives for China. This last quarter of 2010 marked a significant milestone for our business in China as Minute Maid Pulpy, a brand born and launched in China achieved $1 billion brand status in only five years. Minute Maid Pulpy is now our company's 14th billion-dollar brand. The rapid scalability of the Pulpy brand across 18 other markets is actually a testament to our systems' ability to rapidly adopt and scale brand innovation from any part of the world. Looking ahead to 2011, we are adapting our in-market strategies to make sure that we keep building on our strong foundation and remain well positioned to win in China between now and 2020. As more remote areas of China experience accelerated economic growth, we are investing heavily to expand the scale of our distribution. In the fourth quarter of 2010 alone, we opened three new plants to further enhance our ability to serve China's growing consumer and customer base. As the retail trade in the coastal regions further evolves from traditional local outlets to newer and larger channels, we're also investing heavily to grow in the hyper and supermarket channels. And as the Chinese consumer demands increasingly varied and sophisticated offerings, we are innovating and introducing a wider variety of packaged choices that will drive increased transactions and build brand equity.  Our team in China is executing all of these strategic actions to build greater brands across categories to drive strong and sustainable growth in this important market. As we've said before, the real measure of our success in China will be how we continue to seize growth opportunities in that region between now and 2020. While we may see some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, we're confident that we have the right strategy, the right execution plans and the right capabilities in place today, and are better positioned than our competitors to deliver long-term sustainable double-digit growth in China. Our positive full year results in Japan and China were further complemented by our performance across the region. For example, the Philippines, Thailand, Korea and Vietnam each grew double digits for the full year. These four specific countries combined grew well over $100 million incremental unit cases in 2010. This demonstrates the strength and value of our Pacific Group's broad geographic portfolio. In addition, Brazil, Russia, India and China, commonly referred to as the BRIC nations, grew 10% as a whole for the full year. It is worth noting that these four BRIC countries represented over $400 million cases of incremental growth in 2010 or almost 40% of our company's total incremental volume growth for the year. Moving now to Latin America. Volume grew a steady 5% for both the quarter and the full year. We also gained volume and value share in the total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as sparkling and still beverages. This broad-based growth was led by brand Coca-Cola, up 4% for the quarter and 5% for the full year.  Brazil delivered strong results, with volume up 7% for the quarter and 11% for the year. This also marked the fourth consecutive quarter that Brazil has gained volume and value share in total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages.  Mexico volume was up 8% for the quarter and 3% for the full year as weather conditions normalized from the previous quarter. Mexico has now gained non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume share from 15 of the last 16 quarters and value share for 16 consecutive quarters. Our South Latin business, which includes Argentina and Chile, delivered mid-single digit growth for both the quarter and the full year, rounding out another solid and consistent year for our Latin America operating group. Moving to Europe, we saw positive growth in the quarter despite ongoing economic challenges. Volume was up 2% for the quarter and even for the full year. Our performance in sparkling beverages in Europe was led by trademark Coca-Cola up 2% for the quarter and 1% for the full year. Our still beverages in Europe were up 5% for the quarter, with tea up 9% and energy drinks up double digits.  France was up mid-single digits for both the quarter and the full year, making this the fifth consecutive year of positive growth in this key developed market. Additionally, trademark Coca-Cola was up 5% for the full year. Great Britain delivered low single-digit growth for both the quarter and the full year, supported by growth across both our sparkling and still beverage portfolios.  And while economic challenges remain across many parts of Europe, we're starting to see initial signs of recovery. In fact, several Central European countries including the Czech Republic and Slovakia, saw double-digit growth in the quarter, and others such as Romania, Switzerland, Austria, grew mid- to high-single digits in the quarter. And Germany closed the year up 1% its first full year of positive volume growth since 2007. Importantly, we gained volume and value share in Germany to both the quarter and the full year. Now let's turn to an overview of our brands and their performance. As we've said before, we always place our brands first in all that we do across each and every one of the 206 countries around the globe. As a result for the total company, our sparkling beverages grew 3% in the quarter, excluding the benefit of new cross-licensed brands, with international sparkling beverage volume up 4%.  Coca-Cola Zero continues to be one of our fastest growing global sparkling beverages. Earlier, I referenced Coke Zero's uninterrupted string of success in North America. In fact, this momentum extends around the world with Coca-Cola Zero up 9% for the quarter and up 7% for the full year across our international markets. And in 2010, Fanta grew 4% for the quarter and 3% for the full year and became our company's third brand to surpass $2 billion annual unit case sales, along with Coca-Cola and Sprite. We're also successfully expanding our global still beverage portfolio. Total worldwide still beverage unit case volume increased 9% in the quarter and 10% for the full year, led by the further expansion of our global Juice and Juice Drinks and Sports Drinks businesses. In 2010, we grew our overall Juice and Juice Drink business by double digits in the quarter and 9% for the full year. These results build on a very successful decade for our global Juice and Juice Drink business, which delivered a compounded annual growth rate of greater than 9% over the past decade.  Our global Sports Drink business registered a very strong result in 2010, up 14% for the full year. These results, driven by our global FIFA World Cup programs, were balanced across key geographies, including North America, Japan, Spain and Mexico. We also saw ongoing success with the global expansion of vitaminwater with international sales nearly doubling in 2010. vitaminwater is now present in 20 international markets, with plans to launch into four new markets in the first quarter of 2011. This great momentum in our brand portfolio is further supported by a balanced customer-growth plans and our disciplined execution culture. For example, our full year results with our top 10 global retail customers saw high single-digit volume and revenue growth.  Our sales of immediate-consumption beverages grew 4% for the full year, driven by our focused in-store activation efforts and cold drink equipment expansion. In fact, as a global system, we placed over 1 million new pieces of cold drink equipment in 2010 with more than 1/3 of these placed in China, India and Brazil. We're also focused on expanding our right execution daily for Red program. Red is our world class commercial process designed to improve execution at the output level. Our internal pilot studies show that bottlers implementing Red saw an average volume growth of more than 10% over the life of the pilot period. Today, operations representing nearly a quarter of our global volume utilize Red. And going forward, this program will be an area of increasing emphasis and growth for our system. Our results across operations and with our customers around the world point to a well-aligned and focused global Coca-Cola system, vigorously and passionately executing a common set of strategies and delivering on our 2020 Vision.  One of the ways we established such a strong foundation in 2010 was through the innovative and world-class methods: We engage and connect with our consumers each and every single day. Last December for example, we accomplished our most ambitious social media project ever named Expedition 206. Over 365 days, three Coca-Cola Happiness Ambassadors, traveled more than 275,000 miles and visited 186 countries on a mission to seek out and document sources of happiness around the world. Our Happiness Ambassadors brought their adventure to life for fans and followers in real time across social networking sites, bringing millions of people together in a way that only a brand with Coca-Cola's global reach could hope to accomplish. One of the sites in which the story came to life was our Coca-Cola Facebook fan page, where we currently have over 22 million fans, making us the most popular consumer brand page on Facebook. And to put this in perspective, 22 million Coca-Cola fans is roughly equivalent to the average viewership of American Idol, one of television's most popular programs. And our Facebook fan page is growing each and every week, with over 75% of our current fan base under the age of 25. This is another great example of how we are successfully engaging and building brand love with a whole new generation of consumers. As we further build our business momentum across the world, we're also committed to building a better tomorrow. Last month, we announced that we are expanding our collaboration with International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the world's largest humanitarian agency. Together, with our global bottling partners, we worked with the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in more than 50 countries. This partnership has helped provide disaster relief immediately after earthquakes in Haiti, Italy, China and Pakistan, droughts in Kenya, and more recently, flooding in Australia. We're proud to partner with this great organization to extend its worldwide reach. I'd like to invite all of you to visit our website to learn more about these and many other initiatives and programs we have in place to advance our sustainability goals and efforts. 2011 marks the 125th anniversary of Coca-Cola, a refreshing and affordable luxury available to consumers everywhere for just cents at a time. However, Coca-Cola's 125 journey is actually testament to our youth, not our age. There's something special about our enterprise that is in a state of constant renewal and dynamic growth. As we begin the second year of our 2020 Vision, we do so from a position of real strength and real momentum.  We see opportunities ahead as exciting as those our predecessors must have seen 125 years ago, and we intend to capitalize on these opportunities by: first, investing further in our marketing, sales and infrastructure capabilities; secondly, by advancing our sustainability efforts to drive our business and extend our social license to operate everywhere; third, by embedding ourselves even further into our customers' growth strategies; and last but not least, by continuing to innovate across every aspect of our global enterprise. Whether you've been a part of our journey for most of our 125-year history or a more recent investor, we sincerely thank you for your trust and confidence in our business. And as we look ahead to 2020 and beyond, we remain relevantly focused on advancing our global momentum to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value for you and all of our share owners. So with that, let me just turn the call over to Gary. Thank you.\nGary Fayard: Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. To recap Muhtar's earlier remarks, we once again delivered consistent quality volume, revenue and profit growth both in the fourth quarter and for the full year.  Our volume and profit results were in line with or exceeded our long-term growth targets for the fifth consecutive year, reaffirming that our global leadership teams across our system are executing the right strategic plans to achieve our 2020 Vision. Today, we will discuss our comparable currency neutral results for the fourth quarter and the full year. This is consistent with how we've historically communicated our results, as in our opinion, this provides a more complete picture of our underlying business performance.  That said, before going into the details of our financial highlights, we acknowledge that this quarter's comparable currency neutral results include significant structural changes principally related to our recent CCE transaction. For this reason, we're also providing the net impact of these structural changes to help you better understand our results and our performance in relation to our long-term growth targets. To be clear, when we refer to the impact of structural items, these include: the acquisition of CCE's North American operations, new cross-licensed brands, principally Dr. Pepper, the sale of our Norway and Sweden bottlers, the elimination of CCE equity income and some other smaller structural items. So let's start with our earnings results. As outlined in our release this morning, we reported comparable earnings per share for the quarter of $0.72, up 9% versus the prior year. As we shared during our December 2010 modeling call, excluding the impact of one-time items, we anticipated that our recent transaction with CCE would be slightly dilutive to our comparable fourth quarter 2010 results. Today, we confirm that our transaction with CCE was in fact diluted by $0.02 per share to our comparable fourth quarter 2010 results.  For the quarter, our comparable currency neutral net revenues were up 45%, driven by strong 6% increase in concentrate sales, 2% positive price mix and a 37% benefit from structural items. Our full year comparable currency neutral net revenues increased 14%. This growth was composed of a 5% increase in concentrate sales in line with unit case sales, 1% positive price mix and an 8% benefit from structural items. This 1% full year price mix result came in just slightly ahead of our full year outlook, sustaining a year-long trend of sequential improvement. This reflects the recent strength of our developed markets, which helped offset the impact of expected and ongoing geographic mix, given growth in our emerging and developing markets.  As for 2011, it would be reasonable to expect positive price mix results consistent with that as implied by our long-term growth targets. We delivered consistent gross profit growth with our comparable currency neutral gross profit increasing 36% for the quarter and 14% for the full year, including a structural benefit of 28% in the quarter and 7% in the full year. It's important to note that all five of our geographic operating groups have positive comparable currency neutral gross margin growth for the full year. As for our comparable currency neutral operating income, this grew 10% for the quarter and 11% for the full year. This benefit from structural items was 3% in the quarter and 1% in the full year. Currency had a 1% positive impact on operating income in the quarter and 3% positive impact in the full year, which results in comparable operating income growth of 11% for the quarter and 14% for the full year. Comparable currency neutral cost of goods sold increased 60% in the quarter, primarily driven by 52% increase related to structural changes. Comparable currency neutral cost of goods sold increased 15% for the full year, reflecting a 12% increase related to structural changes, bringing our full year cost of goods result in line with outlook we provided in our last earnings call. Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses increased 52% for the quarter, including a 45% impact related to structural items. These results were in line with our expectations and primarily driven by continued investment in our bottling operations, the timing of marketing expenses versus the prior year and higher payouts tied to performance in conjunction with our long-term incentive compensation programs. For the full year, comparable currency neutral SG&A were up 16%, including a 12% impact related to structural items. With regards to operating expense leverage, please remember that we're referring to the point difference between our gross profit growth and our operating income growth of a comparable currency neutral basis, excluding the impact of structural items. For the full year, comparable currency neutral operating expense leverage was in line with our expectations down three points, which includes an adverse six-point impact due to the impact of the structural items. Our healthy operating results across each and every one of our operating groups helped drive our cash flow from operations, up 16% to $9.5 billion.  For the full year 2010, we repurchased $3.1 billion in company stock, which is more than the $2 billion we indicated in our last earnings call. Given the performance of our stock in 2010, we experienced greater activity in our stock option programs at yearend; therefore, we ramped up our repurchases in response to that stock option activity. While many of you rightly decreased our year end share count in your models due to our previously announced share repurchase plans, this greater stock option program activity resulted in our share count, actually remaining almost constant at year end. This higher year end share count versus your modeled expectations equates to an earnings per share impact of between $0.01 and $0.02.  As for 2011, we expect to repurchase between $2 billion and $2.5 billion in stock over the course of the full year, and we'll update you on our progress during future quarterly earnings calls.  Now let me take a minute to follow-up on some of the items we called out during our December 2010 Modeling Conference Call. First, we referenced that in the fourth quarter of 2010, we would benefit from an estimated $5 billion, one-time, noncash gain related to the revaluing of our CCE shares at the closing date fair value. We can now confirm today that this benefit did indeed result in a one-time gain of approximately $5 billion. I'll remind you that this one-time gain does not impact comparable earnings results.  In our December 2010 call, we also mentioned that we would incur a transaction-related gross profit in inventory and fair value adjustment to our cost of goods in the fourth quarter based on our inventory levels at year end. And I can confirm that this adjustment impacted our fourth quarter results by $235 million.  Now let me provide some further updates on a few factors we see impacting our 2011 results. First, we expect to see some different phasing of revenue and gross profit capture in upcoming quarters. As we explained in our December call, prior to the transaction with CCE, revenue and profit related to the sale of our products was recognized when our concentrate shipped to CCE, which we reported as concentrate sales, or in the case of our finished goods product at the time, we shipped the finished goods to CCE. Now that we own the manufacturing and distribution assets to produce and sell these products, the revenue tied to their sale and therefore, their associated concentrate profit, is not recognized until they're sold as physical cases. For example, last year, most of our pre-Easter holiday concentrate sales to CCE were captured in our first quarter 2010 results. This year, most of our Easter holiday-related finished goods sales will likely follow in the second quarter 2011 results. And last year, most of our pre-July 4 holiday concentrate sales to CCE were captured in our second quarter 2010 results. This year, much of our July 4 holiday related finished goods sales will likely fall in the third quarter of 2011 results.  With regard to commodities, our recent acquisition of CCE's North American business has resulted in an adjustment to our company's overall cost structure, especially in North America. Today, approximately 35% of our total company's cost of goods is made up of both the raw material and conversion cost associated with the following four inputs: sweeteners, metals, juices and PET. As you would expect, the bulk of these cost reside within our North American and Bottling Investment Group businesses. We anticipate the underlying commodities related to these inputs will continue facing pressure and volatility in today's marketplace. As a result, we expect the full year 2011 impact of increased commodity cost on our total company results to range between $300 billion and $400 billion.  As per our comments during our December call, prior to the close of our transaction with CCE, we were precluded from hedging the exposures associated with these commodities. We are now actively hedging many of these commodity exposures, much like we traditionally have done with global currencies where we have a history of prudently managing exposure. In addition, it's important to note that many of our derivatives related to these commodity exposures do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP requirements, and therefore, we are required to recognize the unrealized change in fair value of the derivatives in our results. As such, our reported results now reflect any associated unrealized gains or losses related to these hedging activities. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the unrealized gain related to our hedging activities for CCR commodity exposures that did not qualify for hedge accounting was $29 million. We have excluded this gain from our comparable fourth quarter 2010 earnings, even though including it would've improved our fourth quarter comparable earnings as we felt this was the right thing to do in order to provide you with a better understanding of our operating results.  We've called out this $29 million gain in our GAAP and non-GAAP schedules and we'll reflect these gains in future comparable earnings in the same period that we realize a corresponding change in value of the underlying exposure. A related question some of you have asked with regards to the recent rise in commodity prices is the corresponding impact this may have on our 2011 pricing strategies. I can assure you that our long term pricing strategy remains unchanged. Simply said, our goal is to always provide consumers with the right product at the right time, in the right package and at the right price. In this way, we will keep driving sustainable volume and value growth in every market and category in which we compete.  Now let me provide an initial outlook on currencies, including the impact from our hedged positions and the cycling of our prior year rates. We expect currencies to have an even to slightly positive impact on operating income for the full year and in the first quarter of 2011. We will maintain our disciplined approach to SG&A expenses in 2011. Further, we reaffirm our commitment to capture between $140 million and $150 million of cost synergies related to our CCE transaction this year.  Further, we remain well on plan and on track to deliver $500 million in annual savings from our productivity initiatives by the end of this year. And while we continue to cycle the benefits of these ongoing productivity initiatives, we expect to capture positive operating expense leverage in 2011, consistent with what is implied by our long-term growth targets.  From a capital expenditure standpoint, and as I discussed during our December call, our annual capital expenditure needs will increase in 2011 as we incorporate CCE's former North American operations. As I also mentioned during our December 2010 call, we plan to make additional investments to further enhance our operational effectiveness, the net results of these North American specific expenditures will be an increase of approximately $1 billion to our 2011 capital expenditure program. In addition, we plan to make further strategic investments in 2011, primarily related to expanding our production and sales capabilities within our Bottling Investments Group. As a result, we expect our 2011 capital expenditures to range between $3 billion and $3.2 billion. Finally with regard to our tax rate, please note that the variances between our reported and underlying tax rates for both the fourth quarter and the full year was due to the impact of various items affecting comparability. The most significant of which was the $5 billion one-time, noncash gain related to the CCE transaction that I discussed earlier. Looking ahead to 2011, our current best estimate is that the full year underlying effective tax rate will range between $23.5% and 24.5 %.  Before I close my prepared remarks this morning, some of you have asked us to provide additional commentary regarding our long-term growth targets. First of all, we have always viewed these targets as multiyear or long-term targets. We run our business with an aim toward achieving the highest returns for our share owners over time. This philosophy has served us well in the past, and we believe is the right way to run a sustainable, productive and dynamic business. This however, does not mean that we do not closely monitor our quarterly results. As we manage our business quarter-to-quarter, our focus is much more on understanding and identifying short-term macroeconomic trends that may call for us to adjust our short-term tactics as we execute our long-term strategies. And while we often compare our annual performance results alongside our long-term growth targets, our most important consideration is ensuring that every year, we make the right long-term decisions to attain our goals, to achieve our 2020 Vision and beyond.  In closing, our strong 2010 performance results and our consistent belief in the solid fundamentals of this great business provide us with the confidence to reaffirm our company's long-term comparable currency neutral growth rate, which are and have been 3% to 4% volume growth, 5% to 6% revenue growth, 6% to 8% operating income growth and a high-single digits earnings per share growth. Operator, we're now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Bill Pecoriello with Consumer Edge Research.\nWilliam Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: Gary, I know you just had mentioned the long-term target. You delivered really strong 7% organic sales growth here against a tough compare, and that was despite China being down 3% and profit was ahead of the long-term targets. So looking out to 2011, should we expect this kind of growth to be sustained? Will you be disappointed if it wasn't? You mentioned some commodity pressure in investments in the past to 2020, but still looking at the type of growth you're delivering here, what gives you the confidence in sustaining it? And would you be disappointed if it wasn't held at this rate in 2011?\nMuhtar Kent: Bill, let me just provide some context over that question first. This is Muhtar. I think what you need to sort of look at is what is driving that growth? And I think what's driving that growth is really, in still a somewhat mixed economy around the world, challenging economy around the world, is the alignment that we're executing with our bottlers, the alignment that we have to strengthen alignment, the investments that we've been making in our brands in our infrastructure over the past, not just the year but multiple years, the strength of the brands, the strength of the geographic portfolio, all of that is coming to the four, I think, in terms of what you're seeing. Now again, in terms of the world economy, Gary mentioned commodities. There's currency, also in terms of the challenge, inflation coming out of commodities, political issues, uncertainties in some parts of the world as we've seen recently, the incredible amount of cash just sitting on the sidelines, about $2 trillion just in the United States, generally still some lack of confidence. But at the same time, as I mentioned, in 2009, we saw a tremendously difficult environment in some parts like Russia, Eastern Europe. We see some signs of improvement in certain parts of the world, better than they've been in the past and many emerging markets continue to grow. And consumer confidence is good in many of the emerging markets. So I think as we execute our long-term strategy, as we build on our momentum, our strategy is working, and that's what you're seeing coming out with a 5% organic growth in our business for the full year. And again, north of $1 billion unit cases added to our business, which we feel good about in terms of what has been achieved in 2010. But we remain resolutely focused on our execution and continue to drive results with our bottling partners.\nOperator: Our next question is from Carlos LaBoy with Credit Suisse.\nCarlos LaBoy - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG: Muhtar, you're showing tremendous improvement here in your Bottler Investment Group territories. Can you comment on whether there is a new urgency coming into 2011? Or how high a priority there is to make you refranchise some of these territories as you look out over the next couple of years?\nMuhtar Kent: As we've always said, Carlos, our intention is to ensure that we have a very strong, well-aligned franchise system operating on all cylinders across the world. We have tremendous belief in that, and as we see the great execution coming out of our Bottling Investment Group in all the markets that they are in, we will evaluate accordingly and even, I mentioned, even Germany coming out with growth for the first time in a number of years is a testament to that execution capability. And when the time is right, we will certainly find the right home and the right financial conditions for those markets that are operated currently, successfully by our Bottling Investment Group.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Faucher with JPMorgan.\nJohn Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I want to ask a question about the North American pricing. And you talked about, in your commentary, talking about doing the right thing for the long term with pricing. So let's focus a little bit more on the short term here. If I look at the pricing on the quarter, if you assume non-carb positive mix in North America, that would imply -- and plus concentrate pricing to the non-COBO bottlers, that would imply that bottle/can pricing was likely down a little bit in the quarter. So can you talk about your outlook for bottle/can pricing? How that's changed since you've taken over the CCE North American operations? And then Gary, just a little more color on the CapEx piece, your run rate on CapEx for 2011 will actually be sort of greater than your incoming trend plus all of CCE's CapEx. So can you highlight how much of that increase would you say is sort of CCE-related, and how much of that is sort of these additional opportunities that you mentioned?\nGary Fayard: Let me start with pricing. And in fact, if you get underneath it, in fact in North America, we did have positive pricing. We will have positive pricing in North America in 2011 as well. What we're trying to say is that basically, our pricing will be rational but it will also be pricing that's rational, not only in terms of competitors in the competitive marketplace, but also rational pricing in terms of the consumer. And there, we would much rather -- in rational, I mean, take -- let's say not react totally to, I hope, short term volatility in commodities, but take more consistent rational pricing over a period of time over a number of years, which we believe is the right thing for our customers, it's the right thing for our consumers and in fact, will return much greater value to us and actually to the beverage industry over a longer period of time. So we're being very rational about it, we will take that price, and we are increasing pricing in 2011 in North America. So I can confirm that directly. Relative to CapEx, the increase from -- in fact the CapEx, if you look at it, was about $2.2 billion in 2010. And we're talking about going to $3 billion to $3.2 billion in 2011. CCE North America, Legacy CCE North America was around $600 million, $650 million. There's a large piece of that increase then from, let's say, from $2.8 billion to $3 billion to $3.2 billion. A large part of that, more than half of it actually is incremental CapEx that is related to the integration efforts of CCE North American sales. It is -- a lot of it's IT of having rationalizing the various systems to get us all within North America on the same system. Those types of things -- so in fact, what I would expect you will see is over the next couple of years, those investments actually will peak over about two years or they'll start going back down. Then we do have some real opportunities to increase both production and sales execution in a lot of our work. BIG markets, which are growing rapidly as Muhtar talked about in his section. So we're continuing to increase there, as I say, both in production capacity as well as sales execution capability, cold drink equipment, et cetera in those markets to continue to invest in the long term. And then back to the question asked earlier by Carlos, over some period of time a lot of those bottlers will actually be refranchised. And you'd see CapEx go down again relative to that.\nJohn Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co: You had said that pricing was positive in the quarter in North America, so that's implying that the mix was negative?\nGary Fayard: No actually what we're seeing is that actually price mix in North America, I think, was actually flat in the quarter. So you got some mix and everything going on within that, but talking about 2011, we are taking positive pricing.\nJohn Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co: So it probably was down in the quarter, but should be up in 2011?\nGary Fayard: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question was is from Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.\nKaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank: A little bit more on pricing. As it relates to being rational, would you say you're taking pricing up enough to offset commodities based on your view of the consumer? Or is there some that you feel you need to absorb this year?\nGary Fayard: Number one -- thanks, Kaumil, if this was a pretty good year, I hate to ask you what a really good year would be. With that, I don't want to actually get into specifics of exactly what the pricing is because the pricing is not just straightforward. I can't just give you a percentage because what you've got is you've got different pricing by category of beverages. You also have different pricing by channel. You also have different packaging, particularly by package where you got different elasticities on different packages. And we're taking different amounts of pricing on each one of those, what we believe is the right thing to do for the market for customers, for consumers and for the company. So overall, we are pricing at a level that we think is the right thing to do long term, but we are not pricing at a level to say, \"Okay, I have to make up for all of this commodity pressure because commodities go up, commodities go down.\" And I don't want you to then ask me the same question, \"Are you taking your pricing down because commodity prices went down?\" That's not what you do if, in fact, you're trying to continue to build a stronger and stronger brands over the long term, which is what we're into and not a quarter-by-quarter, \"Oh my God, what did commodities do this quarter?\"\nMuhtar Kent: Kaumil, just one other point about pricing, but also about mix, which is important. We've seen signs, not fully out of the woods, but certainly signs of improvement in our Immediate Consumption business across the world. That business, of course, is higher revenue per unit case and also higher margin. And I think that you will see, I believe that as we move through 2011, that we will continue to see those signs, and therefore, mix will help us also in the way our business moves through 2011.\nGary Fayard: Kaumil, I'd add one other item as well. I think everything, pretty much we've been talking about on this subject is relative to North America. When you get outside of North America, you actually start getting into a different set of answers. Because in those, in many other markets, you've got very different market dynamics. You've got very different inflation rates, et cetera. And so you get into different answers and really is, you have to kind of go country-by-country specifically.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Building on that notion of a good year, I was wondering if you could step back for us, Muhtar, maybe, Gary, you too, and talk a little bit about the incentive structures you see today inside of Coca-Cola and the incentive structures out there at your bottlers and things you have some influence over to try to build on the success you've had over these last couple of years, kind of promote that notion of constructive discontent? What tweaks do you think are being made, might be made, to incentive structures within Coke and then in your relationship with bottlers that will allow you to deliver on the opportunity you see for yourself over the next few years?\nMuhtar Kent: First, just let me take the second piece first, the bottlers. I think what I'm very, I'm consciously pleased with the alignment we have with our bottlers. Obviously, there's always room for improvement, but we're really acting as a holistic, very coordinated system. And I think it's a really win-win approach. And we've always said, we cannot over the long term succeed unless our bottlers succeed in the marketplace. And I think that is the philosophy that permeates through the Coca-Cola organization across every single country where we operate, whether it's a single bottler, multiple bottlers, whether it's a mixture of BIG and franchise bottlers or pure franchise bottlers. So I think that is certainly something that we will guard and build on very, very carefully. In terms of incentive structures, simply said, Mark, I think what you're seeing is we are aligning more and more our incentive structures to our 2020 Vision. It's not about budgets, it's not about the numbers, it's all about achieving and surpassing our 2020 Vision. And that's what we're building, reconfiguring evolving our incentive structures to match the 2020 Vision requirements. And that's what you'll see us engaged in a very material way.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And can you share with us, Muhtar, as we think about North America specifically in 2020 and of course now, owning the bottler or most of your bottling ops [ph] here, how we might see some of those structures change over the near to intermediate term here in North America?\nMuhtar Kent: All I can tell you is that on North America, Mark, I'm very pleased with our execution and also our integration both simultaneously. And so we have a new company with new people, new organization, a great passion to succeed in the marketplace. And as we continue to execute and continue to grow sustainably our business in North America, which we've always believed in and said, I've always said that, this should be viewed as a growth market. It\u2019s got wonderful demographics, and it will have even better ones, better demographics as we move into the next decade. We will continue to work very diligently to make sure that the structure meets the needs for us to achieve our 2020 Vision, and we're working on that too. But I can't give you any further details.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: If I could, this commodity topic, obviously a big topic, and some of this Q&A helpful. But if I could press a little bit more, when we think about that $300 million to $400 million number, it sounds like that is a net number, so to speak. It's net of the pricing you anticipate to take around the world and it's net of any offsetting mixed benefits. Is that a fair understanding of what you're portraying in that $300 million to $400 million number?\nGary Fayard: Mark, this is Gary. No actually, what I was giving you was actually the gross number. So the impact -- what we see today is that the gross impact to the company from commodities will be in that $300 million to $400 million range, again primarily North America and our Bottling Investments Group. That will be offset to the extent we have positive pricing, et cetera.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Lastly, as we -- I don't know, Muhtar, if we -- how difficult it is to generalize, but this rising commodity pictures is obviously not just a cost issue, it's a purchasing power issue. Can you perhaps just wax a bit here generally about markets where you're seeing it proving more challenging from a purchasing power standpoint and markets where you think it's a lot more manageable, vis-\u00e0-vis your ambitions for growth?\nMuhtar Kent: We have not seen any -- it's too early to say what the results are and how all of this is going to evolve. And we have to see, obviously a lot of harvest coming up in the next few months, it will have a bearing. There's a lot of -- what you see around the world, there's a short-term and there's a long-term. Over the long-term, no question, demand going up in the world, middle class will continue to put pressure on commodity long term. Short term, there's different things happening that create what we see today, and they will be short term, and they can change. They can go either way. And short term, what are we seeing? Elimination of subsidies, vagaries of the weather, speculation, all of those coming together that's driving up some, creating some of the current situation. Now we haven't yet seen any of the major, any of the big social consequences that we saw two, three years ago because it's too early and also it's a different environment than it was back then. So I think our business is really built for these kind of times. As I said moments of pleasure a sense at a time, and I think that, that's the key. We're not selling big-ticket items and over 50% of what we sell is impulse. And as long as we execute well, we will continue to drive our results.\nOperator: And our final question today is from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Muhtar, just on China, obviously, you had a pretty tough comp here, but the full year gross was also below what we've been seeing in that market historically. I'm just wondering if you can just talk about maybe whether you're seeing increased competitive pressure. Obviously Tingyi has been pretty aggressive in their growth strategies. You got Pepsi stepping up investments. Is the competitor pressure building in that market more than you anticipated? And some of the adaptation that you talked about to your in-market strategies, is that sort of a function of just a competitive landscape getting tougher?\nMuhtar Kent: First, Judy, China is a long-term growth story. And we feel very good about our growth prospects in this market. If you look at last two years, compounded with generated double digits, we're also a multi-category player, being number one in two categories, sparkling and juice, and number three in water. And that we're twice the size of our -- more than twice the size of our primary international competitor. We've got the best distribution, best infrastructure in China. We opened just three very large modern plants in the last quarter of last year, and we believe that growth in China is not only to be measured in quarters. We were cycling 29%, which was a huge number from prior year. But it's about delivering consistent, sustainable double-digit growth over the long term, and I think we see great prospects in China. And if you look again over the last sort of two, three years, yes, the competitive environment is increasing in China. But I think we're well prepared with our brands, with our portfolio, with our infrastructure, with our partners to ensure that we can continue to win in China in that great market.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Gary, just on the buyback plans for 2011, just given how much cash you have on your balance sheet and how much cash you're generating, it just feels like $2 billion to $2.5 billion is very conservative. So I'm just wondering what is kind of holding the board back from committing to a higher buyback here?\nGary Fayard: Well first, the board hasn't met yet. The board meets next week. Number two, I think it's always prudent to start out the year in a kind of a conservative fashion. And as we go through the year and get into it, that's where we'll update you each quarter as we go through it. I think we just kind of see how we came out and how we're doing through the year, and we'll just update you as we go through.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Gary, and Jackson. Before we conclude our call, I'd just would like to remind you that Steve Cahillane, our President and Chief Executive Officer of Coca-Cola Refreshments will join me as we present at Cagney on Wednesday, February 23. We'll provide a further overview of how we're advancing our global momentum around the world, as well as here in North America. Both Gary and Sandy Douglas, our President of Coca-Cola North America, will also be in attendance at Cagney. In addition, Gary and Steve will also present at the upcoming CAGE Conference in London on Wednesday, March 30. We'll look forward to seeing many of you at these great 2011 investor and analyst events. And in closing, I'd like to say that we feel good about how the Coca-Cola Company is performing today and where we are headed tomorrow. We do see tremendous opportunities ahead in all of our global markets, and we remain intently focused on executing our key strategic priorities, all while generating long-term profitable growth for our system and sustainable rewards for our shareowners.

Please look on our website for this information. Now, I will turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Jackson, and good morning everyone. First, let me begin by saying that we are very pleased with our third quarter performance. We successfully completed our acquisition of Coca-Cola Enterprises, North America business, and the sale of our Norway Sweden bottling operations to CCE, on plan and in line with our commitments and we close this transaction on the heels of executing a strong quarter. We continue to build on our momentum, delivering solid volume revenue and profit growth this quarter with our results exceeding all of our long-term targets and generating sustainable value for our shareowners. This quarter, once again underscores how we are advancing our 2020 vision from a position of strength as we enter a new era of growth for the Coca-Cola Company. Together in close alignment with our global bottling partners, we are executing with excellence around the world. Our strategies, our brands, our marketing, our innovation, our partnerships and our people are defining new growth opportunities today, and shaping our system vision for this decade. Our brand equity is growing stronger around the world as evidenced by a measurable increase in consumer preference for our brands this quarter as well as more potent global growth for our flagship brand Coca-Cola on a year-to-date basis. We are now intensely focused on driving a fast and seamless integration in our North America operations, and this evolution of our franchise system is an important milestone in realizing our 2020 vision, strengthening our commitments to best serve our customers and our consumers and facilitating our ability to achieve sustainable and profitable growth in our flagship market. Turning to our current results, this quarter\u2019s comparable currency neutral operating income growth was 14% ahead of our long-term growth target. We grew our quarterly volume a solid 5% also ahead of our long-term growth target fueled by organic unit case volume growth across both North America and our international operations. We increase net revenues a healthy 8% on a comparable currency neutral basis in the quarter bringing our year-to-date comparable currency neutral revenues to 5%. This is in line with our long-term growth target. And once again we generated significant cash from our operations with cash flow up 15% year-to-date. Now, I will share our performance results in more detail across our market starting with our flagship market. North America volume grew 2% this quarter, the second consecutive quarter of positive organic growth. On a year-to-date basis, our North America business is now up 1%. These results are due to the continued successful execution of our well-defined brand pack and price strategy focus on driving profitable growth. Our sparkling beverages in North America grew volume and value share, both against the total category as well as versus our primary competitor. And to be clear, when we speak about share swing gains versus our primary competitor in North America, we refer to our performance across all channels, not just measured channels, which represents less than 40% of our North America business. Brand Coca-Cola health measures keep improving as we increased our favorite brand score versus our primary competitor amongst the most critical consumer segments. At the same time, Coca-Cola Zero delivered double-digit volume growth for the 18th consecutive quarter. Band Sprite had the second consecutive quarter of positive growth, and is now positive on a year-to-date basis and Fanta had its strongest quarter of the year growing 4%. We further extended the footprint of our innovative Coca-Cola Freestyle Fountain Dispenser, which is on track to be in 15 markets by the end of this year providing a greater choice of brands to our customers and our consumers. This all reaffirms our confidence that we are executing the right strategies with our bottling partners to drive growth across our entire North America sparkling beverage portfolio. Turning to North America still beverages, these also continue to accelerate up a strong 8% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date. We have now grown volume share for 11 of the past 13 quarters and value share for 12 of the last 13 quarters. Our North America juice and juice drink business delivered positive growth for the quarter, led once again by double-digit growth from our Simply trademark. Our North America energy portfolio also accelerated this quarter up 15% including double-digit growth by NOS. In the North America tea category, our Gold Peak brand delivered double-digit growth in both its bottle can and food service delivery forms. I also would like to highlight how our North America still beverage portfolio works in concert to generate value. First our Glaceau brands were up mid-single digit this quarter in North America continuing a yearlong trend of sequential improvement. Secondly, Powerade was up over 30% in the quarter outperforming the North America sports drink category while gaining share against our primary competitor for the eighth consecutive quarter. This performance is not a new turn of events or simply due to price discounting, but rather the results of implementing a clear, consistent and competitively sustainable strategy focused on innovation, consumer engagement as well as brand building. In fact, since acquiring Glaceau in mid-2007, our joint Glaceau and Powerade businesses have gained more than seven points of volume share swing against our primary competitors combined sports drink and functional hydration offerings. This is the power of valuable brands and strong system execution working together in the marketplace. Now, as we begin to benefit from our acquisition of CCE\u2019s North America business, we have an important opportunity to take our execution across our entire North America portfolio to the next level. As we have consistently said, we have the right long-term strategy in place in our flagship market, and we are confident that we are well positioned for the next era of winning. Now, let me turn to Eurasia and Africa, an operating group consisting of nine business units with 89 countries spanning from Africa through the Middle East and India up to Russia. This group grew 12% volume in the third quarter with strong performance across both sparkling and still beverages. Year-to-date growth now stands at 11%. All nine business units in Eurasia and Africa grew this quarter with countries representing more than half of the group\u2019s volume increasing by double digits. This broad-base growth was led by Russia up 30% this quarter and 13% year-to-date. We outgrew our primary international competitor in Russia this quarter. Importantly, this high quality growth was led by the strong performance of our core sparkling brand, which drove almost half of this quarter\u2019s absolute volume growth. In fact, brand Coca-Cola, the single largest nonalcoholic RTD brand in Russia was up 34% this past quarter, gaining both volume and value share. We are also making steady progress in the Russia juice market, the integration of our Multon juice business, which began this past quarter, is advancing as planned. And this quarter we also acquired Nidan a leading juice brand in Russia. This transaction will enable us to further expand our juice offerings in this important market. We also grew double digits this quarter in Turkey, Southern Eurasia complementing high single-digit growth in the Middle East. India meanwhile achieved its 17th consecutive quarter of growth despite facing record rainfall during this summer\u2019s monsoon season and cycling 37% growth in the comparable 2009 period. Importantly, India captured share in both sparkling and still beverages. And on a year-to-date basis we have grown Trademark Coca-Cola 18% in India while our Maaza juice brand is up 24% demonstrating the broad-base strength of our portfolio in this critical market. Our commitment to India is unwavering. Last month, we announced plans to invest up to $120 million in a new plant in southern India and we are excited about the significant and sustainable opportunities this region has to offer over the long term. Another continent we are excited about and keep investing in heavily is Africa. Over the past 10 years, our system has invested more than $5 billion in the African continent and we plan to invest another $12 billion as a system in the next decade. As for this quarter\u2019s performance in Africa, we saw double-digit growth in east and central Africa and mid-single-digit growth in north and West Africa. South Africa delivered 6% unit case volume growth benefiting both from the momentum generated by our FIFA World Cup activation programs as well as our ongoing work to improve our relative market and small store activation capabilities in this key markets. Moving to our Pacific group, overall volume growth was up 11% in the third quarter bringing our year-to-date volume growth to 8%. These results were supported by a return to double-digit growth in China up 12% in the third quarter. China captured volume and value share gains in both sparkling and still beverages. Our sparkling beverages grew high single digits in China led by the strong performance of both brand Coca-Cola and Sprite with Sprite remaining the number one sparkling brand in China for the 14th consecutive quarter. Our still beverages in China were up as strong double digits led by the continued momentum of our Minute Maid Pulpy brand. We are one of only a few true multi-category beverage players in Russia, twice as large and growing faster than our primary international competitor. And while we are pleased to report such good results this quarter, our focus in China is primarily on building our business with great brands across multiple categories to drive strong performance over time. The measure of our success in this country will be how we grow our total business between now and 2020. We are confident we have the right strategies in place to deliver sustainable double-digit growth in China over the long term. We were also pleased to see Japan return to growth up a very strong 11% for the quarter and 3% year-to-date. While this quarter\u2019s volume growth was our highest in Japan in over a decade, we recognize that along with the rest of the beverage industry our business benefited from record high temperatures this summer. That said, our brand portfolio gained further traction with the Japanese consumer. For example, Coca-Cola Trademark was up 11% this quarter, a third consecutive quarter of positive growth driven by effective and exciting summer marketing program and successful FIFA World Cup activation. And our water business in Japan also drove profitable growth with this summer\u2019s launch of I LOHAS Mikan, a new mandarin orange flavored water extending the presence of our industry leading and eco-friendly single served I LOHAS brand. Despite the success we have so far had in Japan this year, it is important to point out that economic headwinds remain challenging for the time being. As for the Philippines, we delivered a fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth with Coca-Cola Trademark growing 12% and still beverages up 20% supported by strong gains in tea, juices and juice drinks as well as water. We also announce our commitment to increase our investments in this critical country by $1 billion over five years as we remain focused on investing ahead of demand. Moving now to Latin America where the quarter volume grew a steady 4% gaining share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, despite adverse weather conditions in Mexico, Columbia and most of Central America. Brand Coca-Cola was also up 4% for the quarter. Brazil delivered very strong results with volume of 13% for the quarter and 12% year-to-date. This also marked the third consecutive quarter that Brazil has gained volume and value share in total nonalcoholic beverages. Mexico volume was even for the quarter cycling 9% growth from last year and impacted by heavy rain during the summer season. Mexico has now gained total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume share for 14 of the last 15 quarters and value share for 15 consecutive quarters. We are confident that Mexico will return to normalized growth over the balance of the year. Lastly, our Latin, South Latin region which includes Argentina and Chile delivered solid mid-single-digit growth. Moving to Europe, we still see customers and consumers pressured by the difficult economic conditions impacting various countries in this geography. For the quarter, our volume was slightly positive rounding to even versus the prior year. Our performance in sparkling beverages in Europe was led by Trademark Coca-Cola which is up 1% for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Our still beverages in Europe saw a positive growth across categories including double-digit growth in energy and tea as well as positive results in both sports drinks and juice and juice drinks. Importantly, our still beverages gained both volume and value share in Europe this past quarter. We were pleased to realize low to mid-single-digit growth this quarter across most of our Western European markets including France, the Nordics and Great Britain. These encouraging results were offset by ongoing economic challenges in South and Eastern Europe. In Spain, despite the ongoing economic crisis, our business once again improved its share trends capturing total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage share this quarter. Our Nordics business grew a solid 6% in the quarter. Norway and Sweden have now transitioned to CCE\u2019s ownership. The move of these bottling operations is consistent with the principles we have always shared regarding our bottling investments group. That is to sell our selected company-owned bottling operations at fair value and at the right time to strategically and financially align bottling partners. As we have said many times before, we will only sell our bottling operation when it is a successful and sustainable business. The Norway and Sweden operations are just that. So, on behalf of our company, I would like to personally thank all of our Coca-Cola associates in Norway and Sweden for their great efforts. They are the foundation upon which a strong business was built and we look forward to partnering with them now that they have joined a new CCE organization. As for Germany, our remaining European bottling operation, it sustained its momentum delivering its fifth consecutive quarter of positive volume growth. You have heard me say time and time again that we always put our brands first in everything that we do, across each and every one of our operating groups. As a result, our sparkling beverages grew 3% in the quarter with international sparkling beverage volume up 4%. As for Coca-Cola Zero, it continues to be one of the fastest growing global sparkling beverages in the world. Earlier, I referenced Coke Zero\u2019s uninterrupted string of success in the North America market. This momentum extends around the world with the brand of 6% in international markets on a year-to-date basis. We are also successfully expanding our still beverage portfolio with total still beverage unit case volume increasing by 11% in the quarter led by double-digit growth in sports drinks and water as well as high single-digit growth in juices and juice drinks. I mentioned before how Powerade has been the growth leader of the sports drink category in North America, but this brand success story is also a global one. Powerade has almost doubled its global share since 2000, and this momentum extended into the third quarter supported by the flawless execution of Powerade global FIFA World Cup campaign across 34 markets. In summary, the sound results across our operations and the balanced growth across our sparkling and still beverages are a testament to our seasoned operating team and global franchise partners. Together, we are executing our 2020 vision in a disciplined, aligned and decisive manner. We are growing our business while holding a more than three to one volume and value share advantage internationally over our primary global competitor. And while we grow our business, the strength of our flagship brand is only getting stronger. This past quarter alone, Coca-Cola was named South Africa\u2019s top brand by the Sunday Times. And Coca-Cola retained its number one ranking in inter-brands rankings of the best global brands for the 11th consecutive year. Despite these recognitions, we can assure you that we are not content, in fact we remain constructively discontent. We realize and appreciate that many near-term challenges remain with our consumers and customers around the world. So as we build, further build our business momentum across the world, we are also committed to building a better tomorrow. When we are doing this is by delivering on our promise to be the global leader in sustainable water use and the industry leader in packaging energy and climate protection.  This past quarter, our PlantBottle package, a newly designed PET plastic bottle made partially from plants, won a Greener Package Award reaffirming our position as a sustainable packaging leader and representing yet another step in our journey to create the bottle of the future. Since making its debut in Denmark in December 2009, our PlantBottle package has rolled out in a variety of sizes across our sparkling and still beverage portfolio. By the end of this year, we will have 2.5 billion PlantBottle packages in the market and we expect to double this number in 2011. The presence of these packages this year alone is equivalent to eliminating almost 30,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide, CO2, and approximately 70,000 barrels of oil. So, our commitment to lead in climate protection is one we have worked on diligently for years. We made a public commitment in 2008 that we would place an additional 100,000 HFC-free coolers in the marketplace by the end of 2010. I am pleased to report that together with our bottling partners, we have fulfilled this commitment five months ahead of schedule having placed our 100,000 incremental HFC-free unit in the marketplace this past quarter bringing our total number of HFC-free coolers in the marketplace to 220,000 units. Another way we are building a better tomorrow is by partnering with our communities. A great example of this is our recent launch of Project Nurture in Kenya. This is a mango and passion fruit and juice sourcing partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Through this creative initiative, we are helping develop local fruit sourcing farms to support our expanding juice businesses around the world. Equally important, we are improving the incomes of more than 50,000 fruit farmers in Kenya and Uganda. We are also building for a better tomorrow by putting up people first. In fact, I spend as much time developing our management team and talent as I do leading our business. Our people are the absolute key competitive advantage and an enabler to achieving our 2020 vision. The real opportunity in developing our people is finding leaders with a global mindset and experience who can effectively lead a multinational, multicultural, multilingual team of associates and bottling partners. To do this, we have a consistent set of criteria we apply when it comes to talent management seeking leaders with a breadth of experience and perspective who can think beyond their geography and also operate in different and dynamic environments. And then, our reputation attracts and retains talent, but we cannot rely on this as our only strategy. Just as we continue to focus on building our brands, we are also investing in our brand as a 21st century employer, which is why I was pleased to see us receive such a high ranking on Universum\u2019s second annual survey to identify the world\u2019s most attractive employers. The 2010 survey was based on data from nearly 130,000 college students all around the world. The Coca-Cola Company moved up five spots since 2009 to number eight in the world according to the surveyed business students, number two amongst consumer goods companies and only the beverage company ranked in the top 20. Let me close by saying that we are confident in our systems ability to win together, align and focus on executing against our consistent growth strategies to achieve our 2020 vision. Despite facing extended economic headwind, we are on course to deliver on our commitment to grow volume, revenue, share and profits in 2010. The integration of our North America business is fully underway and well on track. We have created the right operational structure, which will accelerate our ability to make agile, strategic decisions to build on our strong momentum in this marketplace. As we look ahead, we see a world that is yearning not just for the beverages provided by The Coca-Cola Company, but also for the values and ideals that our brands represent, values and ideals like community, like fun, happiness and the hope for a better tomorrow. This is what inspires the strong and unyielding belief in the growth of our company and our system as well as the long-term value it can create for our shareowners. So with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Gary.\nGary Fayard: Thanks Muhtar. Good morning everyone. As Muhtar said, we once again delivered a quarter of consistent quality, volume and profit growth. Our volume revenue and profit results all came in ahead of our long-term growth targets this quarter, reaffirming that our highly capable leadership team is executing the right strategic plans with our bottling partners to achieve our sustainable long-term goals. These results demonstrate that we are building on our 2010 momentum and advancing our 2020 vision. As outlined in our released, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.92, up 12% versus the prior year. For the quarter, our business delivered strong comparable net revenue growth of 8% in the quarter, driven by a 7% increase in concentrate sales and a 1% positive price mix impact. Our comparable operating income was up a strong 14%, bringing our year-to-date comparable growth to 15%, while currency had a minimal impact on operating income this quarter, it\u2019s had a 4% positive impact year-to-date. Further our comparable gross profit increased 10% with year-to-date gross profit up 9%, again currency had a minimal impact on gross profit in the quarter but has had a 2% positive impact year-to-date.  As for our cash flow from operations, this increased 15% year-to-date to $7.2 billion, this growth was primarily driven by our improved performance including the effects of currency.  Now let me go through some detail around our quarterly results and year-to-date performance. Our sequential improvement in price mix was in line with our expectations with the ongoing impact of geographic mix more than offset by our positive global revenue growth, management strategies. This improvement brings our year-to-date price mix results to even versus a prior year fully consistent with our expectations shared in previous earnings calls. As we communicated before, we expect our price mix to remain even for the full year.  Our comparable currency neutral costs of goods was up 3% for the quarter and is now up 1% year-to-date fully in lined with our communications in previous quarterly calls when we said that we expected our cost of goods to grow in a low single-digit range for the full year. Comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were up 8% in the quarter and up 3% year-to-date reflecting increased levels of marketing expand driven by the cycling of low marketing expenses during the same period last year, which we anticipated and also out lined for you in our last quarterly call. As far our total market expand including both our direct and point-of-sale marketing, this continuous to be positive on a year-to-date basis as we remain committed to investing in our brands for long-term growth. For this quarter we captured 4% points of operating expense leverage, this was a little better than our expectation for the full year that I mentioned last quarter and was driven by greater top line profit growth continued strong focus on cost management and the benefits of our productivity initiatives. Importantly this underscores the unique strength of our global system a system able to simultaneously run highly effective and efficient operations while driving solid top line results. Going forward, we now expect our full year 2010 operating expense leverage to command at the low to mid-single-digit range. Lastly the lowering of our year-to-date effective tax rate from 23.2 to 23% benefited our earnings per share by little less than a penny. Now let me take a minute to highlight a few additional factors we see in the fourth quarter of this year. First I want to remind you that has highlighted in our previous quarterly calls, our comparable result for 2010 reflect the impact of the deconsolidation of certain entities primarily bottling operations due to new accounting guidance that became effective the beginning of this year as far past the requirements. We\u2019ve now reflected the appropriate changes within our GAAP and non-GAAP schedules to provide a comparable income statement for external modeling purposes and it posted to schedule in the investor section of our website that takes into account, this change in accounting guidance to this year and adjusting prior year results. Secondly as per my earlier remarks, currency had a minimal impact on our comparable results this quarter. As thought and as we communicated in our prior quarterly call, we believe that currency will have a slightly positive impact on operating income on a full year basis with this benefit weighted toward the first half of 2010. We expect currency to have a minimal to low single-digit negative impact on operating income in the fourth quarter. Looking-forward what we don\u2019t expect to see a repeat of the currency volatility, we saw in early 2009 and earlier this year, we would expect some further volatility going forward as economics are merged from the global recession differently. Please note that we routinely monitor our exposure to currency actively hedge odd currency such as the Euro and Yen and proactively balance our coverage as appropriate, we\u2019ll keep doing so in this environment in line with our long-term hedging strategies and we\u2019ll keep you updated on our hedging activities. Importantly we will keep managing and investing in our business at the local market level and in local currencies to drive long-term growth and increase the consumption of our brands. On productivity we are well on track, and on plan to deliver $500 million in annual savings from our initiatives by the end 2011, lastly with regard to our share repurchase program, we were out of the market depending the close of our transaction with Coca-Cola enterprises. With this transaction of close we are in a profit of reentering the market and now expect to repurchase approximately $2 billion of share by the end of 2010. Well, on the subject to CCE, let me share a few items regarding the transactions. First the deal closed on October 2, 2010 which was the first day of our fourth quarter ,while this transaction was structured as primarily cash list under terms of the deal we agree to make a cash payment to CCE in the advance that the actual debt assumed upon acquisition was less than the previously agreed upon amount. Therefore, in anticipation of closing the transaction, a cash consideration of $1.3 billion was paid to CCE substantially related to the debt level assumed. This payment was made on October 1st, the last day of our third quarter. Concurrently and as expected we also received about $900 million in cash from CCE for the sale of our Norway and Sweden bottling operations. Both of these transactions are reflected in the quarter\u2019s cash flow statement and balance sheet. As for the recurring result we report today, these were not impacted by the CCE transaction. When we report our fourth quarter and full-year results, these will be the first fully reflecting corporation of CCE\u2019s North American business as well as the divesture of our Norway and Sweden bottling operations. Secondly, when we announced our fourth quarter and full-year result, we will continue to detail our results by our five existing geographic operating groups with the North American operating group fully incorporating our newly constituted Coca-Cola refreshments and Coca-Cola North America Organizations. Finally with regard to synergies, as we have announced previously and reiterated in our earnings release today, we continue to expect synergies of at least $350 million per year phased in over the next four years. We know that many of you are looking for additional modeling information regarding our newly integrated North America business, please note that before the end of this year, we intend to share with you further details regarding our capital and debt structure plans, as well as the impact of other items regarding the modeling of our new North American operations.\n : All of this is a testament to our seasoned management team\u2019s ability to effectively manage and execute our strategies within a challenging market environment. Together with our global bottling partners, we are maintaining our disciplined investment strategies and executing the right actions to drive our business for both today and tomorrow. As such, we remain confident that we will keep enhancing the health of our brands and importantly drive long-term profitable growth and value for our shareowners. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: And thank you sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from Bill Pecoriello with Consumer Edge Research.\nBill Pecoriello \u2013 Consumer Edge Research: Good morning. Muhtar, you had a very strong quarter in North America, relative to where the industry is growing. Can you talk about what the Coke system is doing in the non-measured channels to drive this outperformance and why you think it\u2019s sustainable? Thanks.\nMuhtar Kent: Good morning, Bill. I think you are right in pointing out that we had a good quarter in North America; volume grew 2%, second consecutive quarter positive and I highlight organic growth, and year-to-date volume growth was 1%. I think, if you sort of dig double click and dig down for the quarters, total sparkling was even Trademark and then for the year-to-date when you look at, like Trademark Coca Cola on a year-to-date basis is even versus minus three for the same three quarters the prior year. So, one of the things that is continuing to drive this is our success in our brand price pack channel architecture that we have talked about for a number of quarters that we are implementing. I think another one is our continued strength in our brands. We continue to invest in our brands and it\u2019s paying off, Coca-Cola remains the number one favorite brand and has widened that lead over its nearest competitor, ratio is now 1.6 to 1 versus 1.4 in a year-to-date 2008 for example. Favorite brand scores are again up. Coke Zero favorite brand scores continue to grow at a significant rate. So all of that is paying off and I think it\u2019s important that we have a strategic focus that is consistent on building powerful brands, creating the value with our customer relationships and also a high performance system that is capable of working together to serve our customers and consumers. And I am happy also to point out that in the third quarter as the industry returned to more rational pricing, CCNA, our North American Operation, Coca-Cola USA gained valued share in total NARTD and volume and value share in the sparkling as well as still categories. So, when you look back at say some of the media reports back in the middle of 2008, say June, July, 2008, one of the priorities I outlined at that time, if you look into the clippings and go back into recent history, I said it is to stabilize and return to a sustainable growth our North American Operations. I think that, in no way are we declaring victory, we are in the process of stabilizing as you can see from the numbers. And we are cautiously confident that even in the depth of the most severe crisis that we\u2019ve recently had in the last couple of years in North America and the US consumer is still confused by the way that we are \u2013 our investments are paying off, our alignment with our bottling partners is paying off. And now I think we can accelerate that with this historic transaction. So, I am particularly pleased that as we have gone into this transaction at the end of this quarter, this past quarter, that we go into that transaction from a point of strength, from a position of strength. And as I said the transaction will further enable us to accelerate our momentum, I believe.\nBill Pecoriello \u2013Consumer Edge Research: Then Gary, if I can just quickly follow up. I know you said you are going to update us at year end on some of the deal math, but originally you had said the deal would be accretive by 2012. Interest rates have move down since there, do you see it as likely to be accretive on 2011 earnings?\nGary Fayard: Thanks Bill. I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m going to do, I\u2019m going to give you an update on the answer of that question actually when we get together later in the year. We are putting together all of the numbers now, and to really answer it, you have got to go through all of the synergies. You have got to go through all the purchase accounting adjustments and everything else. Some of those are not complete yet. So while you\u2019re right, interest rates have come down which will be helpful. Let me delay the answer to that question until later this year, but for sure 2012 is accretive whether it\u2019s going to become accretive in 2011, I don\u2019t know yet.\nBill Pecoriello \u2013 Consumer Edge Research: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: And next is Carlos Laboy from Credit Suisse.\nCarlos Laboy \u2013 Credit Suisse: Good morning everyone.\nMuhtar Kent: Good morning.\nCarlos Laboy \u2013 Credit Suisse: Muhtar, could you provide us maybe some more granularity on the Philippines? Can you expand on the infrastructure development that\u2019s facilitating this type of volume growth, maybe talk a little bit about the profitability levels that you might be or improvements that you are seeing out of the Philippines? And on a related basis you are talking more or your management seems to be talking more about transactions and tracking transactions better not just volume; can you speak to how you are using this metric internally and maybe give us a sense of what it\u2019s telling you about transaction growth versus volume growth?\nMuhtar Kent: First, on the Philippines Carlos, I think as we have noticed, we posted a strong quarter of plus 19% growth in the third quarter, which was actually our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. The BIG team, Bottling Investment Group team, led by Ariel [ph] and his associates, I think have done a good job in stabilizing the business first in the Philippines and now we\u2019ve been returning it to sustainable growth.\n : As far as transactions are concerned, at the end of the day you\u2019ve got to remember that consumers don\u2019t buy unit cases, they buy transactions, packages at certain price points. And I think it\u2019s really \u2013 that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for us to track the consumer behavior patterns of consumption in different channels on a transaction basis. And I think that we are certainly seeing the benefit of tracking that metric in the United States, especially as we have offered more choices as part of our brand price pack channel architecture in the United States that\u2019s working well. And you will continue to see a focus on that metric as we widen it across the world.\nGary Fayard: And Carlos this is Gary. And just to be definitional for everyone who is on the call, when as you talk about transactions, the way we define transactions is that a 2 liter package, if you bought a 2 liter bottle, that\u2019s one transaction. If you bought a 14 or 16-ounce bottle, that\u2019s one transaction. If you buy 12 pack of cans, that\u2019s one transaction, and it really then drives into our brand pack pricing architecture, and how you drive value for the brand. So it\u2019s critically important and one of those metrics that we are actively reviewing every month.\nCarlos Laboy \u2013 Credit Suisse: Thank you, that\u2019s helpful.\nOperator: And the next question comes from John Faucher from JPMorgan.\nJohn Faucher \u2013 JPMorgan: Good morning, thank you. Wanted to dial down on a couple of different markets where we saw some, a little more volatility in results than we are used to seeing or at least in Russia\u2019s case more positive volatility. So you guys had mentioned weather is a factor in Japan, Russia and Mexico. Can you just talk a little bit about sort of how you would have seen the normalized trends in those three markets and particularly for Japan and Russia, sort of how you see things normalizing over the next couple of quarters? Thanks.\nMuhtar Kent: John, good morning. You\u2019ve heard we say about Russia and Ukraine, particularly in the past that these markets are linked to more, we should try to think of these are being more volatile markets though go into the crisis quicker, deeper and they\u2019ll come out of the crisis quicker and deeper. We are seeing an exact play of that happening. And I think that Russia over the next sort of three-year period they will normalize to growth rates of sort of double digits I think as we move forward. But again, you\u2019ll see some volatility in Russia play out over the next three years. But I think a more gradual return to a high single digit and double-digit growth rate. As far as Mexico is concerned, you ask the question. I think, during this quarter Mexico and certain regions of Northern South America, the northern part of South America, suffered from very unusual high rainfalls which were, in fact in some cases in Mexico particularly severe enough to disrupt distribution over some prolong periods. And of course also this past quarter, again to remind you that Mexico was typing 9% growth. In the prior year, I\u2019ve said and I think in the call earlier that Mexico, we believe that Mexico will return to a more normalized rate of growth that we have seen in the past periods over the last two, three years. And I think Japan certainly benefited from the extraordinarily positive weather, lack of rainfall and also very high sustained temperatures during the key summer months, July, August. I think that Japan, but again not all of the growth was related to that, some of the programs we are really getting traction, especially in the Kanto region, in Tomei [ph] as well as Coca-Cola bottlers Tokyo and also some of the other outline like Coca-Cola central Japan. And therefore I think Japan we should see Japan, despite the very challenging consumer landscape deflationary environment should return to more of an even to 1% to 2% growth rate normalize over the coming period.\nJohn Faucher \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay, so that\u2019s over the coming period or do you think that\u2019s over the next couple of quarters?\nMuhtar Kent: I think the next coming period meaning sort of the one to three-year period.\nJohn Faucher \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay.\nMuhtar Kent: And then China I think based on the cycling of plus 29%, 30% on the prior quarter in the quarter four certainly we will see some moderation there, but as I said our focus is to benefit from our multi-category positions in China, successful multi-category positions in China and drive sustainable profitable double-digit growth over time leading into 2020.\nJohn Faucher \u2013 JPMorgan: Great, thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.\nJudy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Thanks, good morning. Muhtar just going back to North America as we think about the volume trended 2% certainly is encouraging, but it seems like the price mix benefit has been pretty minimal here. So as you look out over the next six to 12 months and you continue to focus on this brand channels pack architecture, would you assume that you see an acceleration in terms of the price mix benefit? And then over the longer term if you think about the North American business now that you have integrated the CCE North American operation, what do you think is sort of the right revenue growth projection for that part of the business?\nMuhtar Kent: Well, I won\u2019t give you a sort of look-forward statement on the United States business. All I can tell you, Judy, is that, I think in this past quarter net revenues for the quarter increased 2% which reflected a 2% increase in our concentrate sales, and a positive price mix which sort of rounded to even, which was partially offset by deconsolidation of certain entities due to a change in our accounting guidance and I will have Gary comment on this too. But I think it\u2019s really important that price mix will gradually strengthen, I believe, in the United States as sparkling and still \u2013 both our sparkling and still portfolios grow, and as we get traction in terms of a more nimble and faster system in the United States as we transform our business and reap the benefits of successful integration. But it\u2019s really important to note that it is personally very pleasing for me that we can lead in to this transaction with two consecutive quarters of growth. And also importantly this growth is balanced and that you\u2019ve got like Trademark Coca-Cola year-to-date on an even basis compared to say minus three for the first three quarters of prior year, and Coke Zero still doing very well in double-digit growth. And so I think and then our still beverage strategy is really working very well. The total still beverage is up 8% on a year-to-date basis up 5% and that\u2019s driven our success in both the juice segment as well as sports drinks. As I mentioned, energy, tea, all working together, coming together to generate this balance growth in the United States. And I think, again you can expect the price mix to gradually strengthen, but it\u2019s really important that we continue to invest in our brands and in our infrastructure in North America and that\u2019s effective, our marketing is paying dividend. The strength of our brands are paying dividends, and especially in this third quarter, this past third quarter were there was price rationalization in the industry that we can still generate 2% organic growth was particularly encouraging.\nJudy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Okay.\nMuhtar Kent: Gary, you want to comment on some?\nGary Fayard: Yeah, Judy just a couple of things. First, there was a negative one point from structural change and that was the deconsolidation of Honest Tea this year versus it was consolidated last year just to make that adjustment. The other, I think, and it\u2019s just expanding on what Muhtar just said, I think if you look at our pack price architecture particularly on the smaller entry level $0.99 pack, while that has some negative pressure actually on gross profit and price mix is absolutely the right thing to do, really helping with recruitment, really helping us drive transactions as Carlos was asking about earlier. And I think it\u2019s one of the things together with I think very successful marketing programs is driving those brand preference score. So, this is one of those examples where North America went down over a long period of time and it\u2019s going to take us some time to really get it back, but I\u2019m really optimistic and confident because of where we are starting from right now.\nJudy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs: And Gary, just a quick follow-up. You called out the favorable timing of G&A in North America, the benefits in the quarter from a profit perspective. Is there a way to quantify how much that helps the profitability in the quarter?\nGary Fayard: No, and really what we had is, we had some reversals of some compensation plans last year. And it was both in North America and in the corporate segment. And in fact, reversed in the third quarter and then reinstated in the fourth quarter. So you\u2019ve got some timing swings between quarters.\nJudy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thanks.\nGary Fayard: Thanks.\nOperator: And next is Kaumil Gajrawala from UBS.\nKaumil Gajrawala \u2013 UBS: Hi, good morning everybody.\nMuhtar Kent: Good morning.\nKaumil Gajrawala \u2013 UBS: What\u2019s on Europe as you move through the quarter, would you say that trend is strengthened or weakened maybe month to month? And then second thing, shipments were about 100 basis points it looks likes ahead of [Inaudible] sales, is that something that you reverse in 4Q? Thanks.\nMuhtar Kent: Kaumil, I think it\u2019s fair to say that as far as the general trends are concerned, if you had looked at the Q2 trend of minus 1 and the Q3 trend of even certainly that\u2019s an improvement going sequential improvement. And I think, again Europe has been a little bit; continue to be a Tale of Two Cities type of the West being performing better continuatively with higher per capita, as we mentioned markets like France and Benelux and Great Britain. But also at the same time, East and Southeast Europe still very challenged from Iberian Peninsula to Greece and Southeast Former Eastern Europe countries like Romania and Czech Republic, Hungary, Central Europe, all remained more subdued and consumer confidence being still very challenging in that environment.\nKaumil Gajrawala \u2013 UBS: Got it, and on the shipments?\nMuhtar Kent: Gary, you want to comment on the shipments?\nGary Fayard: Yes, I would expect shipments to pretty much be in line in the fourth quarter with volumes like I think year-to-date; they are pretty much in line and should be in the fourth quarter as well.\nKaumil Gajrawala \u2013 UBS: Got it. Thank you.\nGary Fayard: Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Christine Farkas from Bank of America.\nChristine Farkas \u2013 Bank of America: Thank you very much. Gary, just a couple of housekeeping items. I wanted to confirm currency, was that actually neutral on the top-line as well as profits in the quarter? And could you comment on CapEx targets? Certainly, we hear a lot about Coke\u2019s planned investments in a number of emerging markets, and I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s putting some upward pressure on your overall CapEx targets in bigger picture.\nGary Fayard: Hi Christine, currency on revenue was pretty much minimal. And currency basically for the quarter was minimal as its very little impact. And we expect a little bit in the fourth quarter it looks like, but it\u2019s not going to be major. Relative to CapEx, most of those investments we talk \u2013 when we talk about investments in all those countries, it\u2019s really system investments as our sales and the bottlers, and much of that is actually bottler investment. We\u2019ll go through later this year and talk about CapEx for next year. But I would expect CapEx for this year to be pretty much in line with what we had talked about earlier in the year. And CapEx for next year will go through as we pull all of our plans together for 2011, which you and I can see significant changes.\nChristine Farkas \u2013 Bank of America: Okay. Thanks for that. And just a quick follow-up on South Africa. Certainly volumes, last quarter were flat and now we\u2019ve seen a nice acceleration post the World Cup. I\u2019m wondering if there is something structural or economic happening there and what\u2019s the sustainable type of direction?\nMuhtar Kent: Christine, hi. I think we were very pleased with the effective execution of our World Cup programs. And I think it has, again helped our brands on a sustainable basis in South Africa. The sparkling category showing recovery with improvements in the new 1.25 liter returnable glass bottle and also as I said the FIFA World Cup programs, I think Fanta is performing well after we made some, again pack changes. Activities in general have yielded good results, and consumers still trading down to more affordable options. We see that, especially in juices and waters, and we still see some heavy discounting going on. But I would say overall the consumer psyche is beginning to recover from the hard economic conditions of 2009. As you would recall that last year GDP shrank by about 2 \u2013 between 2% to 2.5%. If I recall in 2010, GDP is estimated to be at around plus 4%. And we are benefitting from that also.\nChristine Farkas \u2013 Bank of America: Okay. Great. Thanks for that Muhtar.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus.\nMark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus: Yes, thanks good morning everyone. Gary, I had a modeling question and Muhtar something on North America. And I hear you Gary on unit volume and gallonage in line are roughly in line fourth quarter. I\u2019m wondering, when I look back I see unit volume and gallonage in line in the first quarter, in line in the second quarter and then that up seven versus up five here in the third quarter and yet they\u2019re described as year-to-date in line. Any thoughts on that? Again, the go forward is the key here. But any thoughts on, my number is wrong or what\u2019s going on there?\nGary Fayard: Hi Mark, good morning. I\u2019ll have to go back and look at it by quarter. What I looked at was just the third quarter and year-to-date. And while it\u2019s two points ahead in the quarter gallons versus cases, it\u2019s right at exactly the same year-to-date, and I would expect fourth quarter to be right in line as well. And what you\u2019re seeing is just the seasonality of the business. And as the business was accelerating in the third quarter, the bottlers are obviously just ordering more and more concentrate, because they had been behind in ordering up this first two quarters. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything unusual in that at all. And I think, as I said, it\u2019s come back in line year-to-date and I would expect it to stay in line in the fourth quarter.\nMark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus:\n :\nMuhtar Kent: I think, first we got to see what it \u2013 it\u2019s really important to point out, Mark, that over the crisis in the depth of the crisis 2009 full year and this year, we have continued to invest heavily in our brands in North America. It\u2019s really important that be understood well. I mean, to the two notes, if you take marketing and total CapEx of the bottling system combined in 2009, numbers around north of 2.5 billion. This year it will be getting close to maybe another sort of 10% higher than that in total. I\u2019m talking about marketing as well as CapEx investments en route to market production efficiency, IT, marketing, brands, all of that. So again, I\u2019ve said before, we cannot, we have to really capitalize on this current economic crisis and that\u2019s what you\u2019ve seen us doing all around the world including in the United States, and continue to invest in our brands in our system and that\u2019s paying off. When you look at the whole world when we, again globally gained total value share and held volume share in the quarter as the 13th consecutive quarter of value share gain globally. So you\u2019re seeing that paying off. And as Gary said, most of these investments, a lot of these investments are coming from the system. We generate as a system north of $20 billion of cash, annually $20 billion. And that\u2019s what, when we announce $5 billion in Mexico for the next five years, $6 billion in Brazil for the next five years, $3 billion in China over \u201809, \u201810 and \u201811. These are system investment numbers that are driving our business, because you heard me say before critically important to judge the appetite of our bottling system for more territory and investments. And that is at an all-time high, and our brands are at an all-time high in terms of their current metrics around the world, including here in the United States.\nMark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus:\n :\nMuhtar Kent: I think it\u2019s too early to judge any of that. We are just continuing to execute and I think you\u2019re seeing a lot of volatility in international markets on both currency and on commodities, commodities somewhat driven by big reason the weather, but also driven by volatility in currencies as you know, because commodities are priced in US dollars. So we are looking at all of that and we have seen this movie before and we will certainly make appropriate measures to ensure that our business remains in health.\nMark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus: Fair enough. Thank you guys.\nMuhtar Kent: Thanks. So with that in closing, I\u2019d like to just say that we had a strong third quarter and remain on course to grow volume, revenue share and profits in 2010. The integration of our North America business is on track and our new operational structure in North America will accelerate our ability to build on our momentum in this marketplace. So as we look ahead, we see tremendous opportunity for the Coca-Cola Company in all of our markets and geographies. We remain intently focused on working with our capable system partners to build our brand, execute our strategic priorities and drive long-term sustainable growth and value for our shareowners. Thank you for joining us this morning.\nOperator: And thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call.

Please look on our website for this information. Now, I will turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you Jackson and good morning everyone. Let me begin by saying that I am broadly pleased with our second quarter performance. We once again delivered a quarter of solid growth with consistent profitable results around the world. Working closely with our great bottling partners, we continue to advance our 2020 vision and road map for winning together. The global equity of our brands is strong and growing stronger. Our worldwide FIFA World Cup activation was a tremendous success, bringing Coca-Cola to billions of consumers across cities, across towns, villages and living rooms the world over. And consumers clearly continue to prefer our brand with brand Coca-Cola growing 5% for the quarter and 4% year-to-date. Additionally, we saw extensive share gains this quarter across key beverage categories including sparkling, packaged water, ready-to-drink juice and juice drinks as well as sports drinks. As a result, we gained volume and value share in global non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. We also gained global volume and value share in both the sparkling and still beverage categories. At the same time, the global economy remains uncertain due to deficit concerns in Europe, recent downward revisions to China\u2019s economy and continued weakness in consumer confidence in the certain pockets of the world. This cloudy global economic picture however does not dampen the strong commitments we\u2019ve made to invest in our global operations and our brands for long termed sustainable growth. We\u2019re also encouraged by the real progress we\u2019re making in our plans to integrate CCE\u2019s North American bottling business. This transaction remains on track to be completed in the forth quarter of 2010.  Now turning to current performance results. This quarter we delivered strong 15% operating income growth on that comparable basis. Again on a comparable, currency neutral basis, our 11% operating income growth was well ahead of our long term growth target despite the lingering effects of the global recession. We grew our quarterly volume, a strong 5%, cycling 4%, bringing our year-to-date volume to 4% at the higher end of our long term growth target. This was fueled by solid organic unit case volume growth across both North America, as well as key international markets. We increased net revenues 7% on a comparable basis in the quarter with our comparable currency neutral revenues coming in at 5% in line with our long term growth target. And once again, we have generated significant cash from our operations with cash flow up 18% year-to-date. Now I will take a moment to share our performance in more detail across our markets and I will start by reviewing our business in North America which I\u2019m pleased to say is continuing to gain momentum.  North America grew 2% this quarter, returning this region to positive growth. In fact, we gained both volume and value share across both sparkling and still beverages. Equally important to this growth is how it is been achieved in this critical market. First, we are focused on building strong value creating brands led by brand Coca-Cola which grew both volume and value share this quarter while increasing our favorite brand score advantage versus our primary competitive among key consumer segment. Second, we are focused on generating profitable growth by delivering a more sophisticated price, package and channel architecture in the United States.  For example, we forged strong gains in our highly profitable immediate consumption offerings. In previous calls, we have highlighted the success of our smaller single-serve packages and the role, the critical role they play in generating millions of incremental transactions. We are clearly building on this momentum. Additionally, we have seen 4% year-to-date growth of our portion control offerings in the supermarket channel. The growth of these offerings that provide consumers a choice of packages below 12 ounces with 100 or fewer calories is driven by our new 90-calorie mini can. And the recent introduction of our innovative 2 liter contour package has helped Trademark Coca-Cola enter nearly four million new households\u2019 year-to-date. Importantly, our still beverages in North America were up 7% for the quarter. We have now grown volume share for 10 of the last 12 quarters and value share for 6 of the last 7 quarters. Across North America we are expanding the footprints of our innovative Coca-Cola Freestyle Fountain dispenser. This summer, we are adding another 500 machines as part of our pilot test and early results show that our customers are very, very excited about Coca-Cola Freestyle and the greater choice of brands available to distribute in their outlooks.  For the past two years, we have voiced strong confidence in our strategies in North America and we told you that we would return growth to our flagship market. What we are seeing today is not an [admiration]. We firmly believe that North America will be a growth market of great opportunities for the next ten years and beyond. This market is driven by an extremely positive demographic profile, the envy of a developed world. We are confident that the actions we are taking today will only strengthen our future in North America and that we are positioned to capture more than our fair share of the great value, this important market has to offer. Now let me turn to Eurasia and Africa which saw broad based growth of 10% in the second quarter and 11% year-to-date. This dynamic growth was led by India, up 22% in the quarter and a strong 24% year-to-date despite cycling over 30% growth for both the quarter and year-to-date.  India has now delivered 8 consecutive quarters of double digit growth. Additionally, we gained volume and value share this quarter across most key beverage categories in India. We also saw double digit growth for the quarter in Turkey and Southern Eurasia and high single digit growth in the Middle East. In Africa, we just recently announced our systems commitment to more than double our investment in our business to 12 billion through 2020. This past quarter, we saw double digit growth in Eastern and Central Africa and high single digit growth in North and West Africa.  This growth was led by the strong performance of both our sparkling as well as still portfolio and the immediate benefits of course of our FIFA World Cup activation programs across the entire continent of Africa. Russia importantly also improved on this first quarter momentum, delivering 6% growth in the quarter, bringing volume growth up to 3% on a year-to-date basis. This improvement has been driven by the sustained strong performance of our sparkling brands and in particular brand Coca-Cola which once again gained share while growing a strong 19% in the second quarter. Moving now to Latin America, where we continued our steady and consistent performance. For the quarter, we were up a solid 7%, supported by a strong FIFA World Cup activation program. We outperformed the industry, gaining non alcoholic ready-to-drink volume and value share across multiple key markets including Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico. These great results were driven by a strong 13% growth in Brazil and as expected, Mexico rebounded well from the unseasonable cold weather in quarter one, growing 5% in the second quarter, cycling 6% from the same period prior year. Our Pacific Group continued to expand, growing 6% in both quarter two and year-to-date led by double digit growth across Thailand, the Philippines and several other markets in this region. Our volume performance in Japan was the same as in quarter one, down 3% for the quarter, cycling positive 2% growth from last year. This result was a little better than expected as Japan continues to suffer from economic headwinds as well as unfavorable weather conditions.  Despite these challenges, our brand portfolio continues to gain traction with our consumers. For example, Coca-Cola trademark in Japan grew 2% in quarter two, while our Georgia Coffee brand showed positive growth in its core and most profitable vending channel. Our [ILO house] single-serve water continues to grow double-digit even as the cycling last year\u2019s May launch. In fact, since the quarter one of 2008, immediate consumption water volume as a percent of total water volume in Japan has improved by over 20 percentage points. This is a great example of how we are executing a strategy of focusing on profitable system volume. And we just launched Sokenbicha tea in an innovative double eco bottle which is both a plant bottle as well as ultra light weight. Overall, we are encouraged by the improving trends observed in Japan during this past quarter and believe we are executing the right strategies. Yet, we remain cautious as we expect the economic headwinds in Japan to continue in the near-term. China also maintains its quarter one performance growing 6% in quarter two, cycling 14% from prior year. We outperformed the industry this past quarter, growing both volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Further, we are more than twice the size of our primary international competitor in China and we once again widened our lead in terms of total unit cases sold. We saw sequential improvement over the course of the quarter with our strongest overall growth in June including positive sparkling growth. We also captured value share in our sparkling beverages in the quarter. And we continue to grow our still portfolio this quarter with our innovative Minute Maid Pulpy brand, up double digits and our overall still beverage is up a strong 30%.  Clearly, with the consumer fundamentals and our very strong position in China, we\u2019re just getting started in this region. We are working hard to build our business across all categories and especially our sparkling beverages. Our system has committed to investing $2 billion in China through 2011 and we remain dedicated to growing in China for the long term. A good prove point of our commitment to grow in this exciting region is our participation as the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai. Our interactive pavilion has been rated as one of the Expo\u2019s most popular attractions and our presence in the Expo has already generated close to $17 million in ad value in the first month since its opening. We encourage all of you to visit our pavilion if you\u2019re in Shanghai in the coming months and experience first hand, how we are building brand equity in China for the long term. Now moving to Europe, we\u2019ve seen that consumers and customers are still pressured by the difficult economic conditions that have impacted this region. For both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, our volume rounded down to minus 1% with solid growth in France, as well as growth in Germany and Iberia, offset by ongoing challenges in Southern and Eastern Europe.  Our beverage business in Europe is almost four times the size of our primary international competitors, and this quarter we gained volume and value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages across the continent of Europe. And Germany is sustaining momentum capturing volume and value share while delivering its fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth. Year-to-date, total volume in Germany is up 3%, and importantly, brand Coca-Cola volume is up 4%. We are encouraged by how we continue to build brand preference for our consumers and drive value for our customers.  Going forward, as we look at our total business in Europe, we remain cautiously optimistic despite difficult economic conditions. These global results, despite difficult operating conditions in some regions are a testament to our seasoned operating team and our global franchise partners for executing our 2020 vision in a disciplined, aligned and decisive manner. We are working as an effective and integrated business system in order to best serve each market\u2019s unique customer and consumer needs and we are gaining market share despite a challenging global marketplace.  We recently concluded a brand equity analysis for Coca-Cola across our top 22 markets from 2007 to 2009 looking at multiple brand health metrics such as favorite brand and the number of weekly and monthly consumers. The results of this analysis show that when looking across all our top 22 markets as a whole, these key metrics improve between one and two points during this two-year time period. To see our brand equity scores trend, brand equity scores trend upwards during a time of macroeconomic pressures, demonstrates clearly our success in connecting closely with our consumers to build brand equity across the markets which we proudly serve. Looking ahead, we remained intently focused on what critically matters to our business, communicating with our consumers and investing in our brands. Let me briefly update you on some of the ways we\u2019re doing this. First, communicating with our consumers. Having just returned personally from South Africa, I can confirm that our 2010 FIFA World Cup program has been very, very effective. It is our best example of how we can collaborate as a global team with our bottling partners to create powerful and integrated programming to build our brands. We have leveraged one campaign throughout 116 markets and drove our most unified marketing communications effort yet. All by capitalizing on our global scale while communicating locally relevant, as well as compelling stories that meaningfully connect with consumers all over the world. Our Powerade\u2019s FIFA World Cup program was rated near the top of all World Cup campaign as tested, surpassing norms on all key measures. Importantly, consumers are responding to our World Cup messaging. Our FIFA inspired World Cup anthem Waving Flag has been a real hit, reaching the number one position on the music charts in 17 countries, moving more than 800,000 download purchases and amassing more than 87 million video views on YouTube. A survey conducted in the UK by Lightspeed, found that when asked to name their favorite FIFA World Cup ad of the year, consumers rated Coca-Cola, Number One. And when we purchased a FIFA World Cup related tweet on Twitter, the results were absolutely phenomenal. In the first day, after the tweet went online, our ads received over 85 million impressions and a 6% engagement rate, compared to the 0.02% rate usually seen with other web based advertising. That translates into over 5.1 million people interacting with our FIFA World Cup ad in just a 24 hour span. Our innovative use of online marketing and social media is not just limited to the FIFA World Cup campaign however. Our \u201cHappiness Machine\u201d video showing hidden camera footage of smiling students interacting with a generous Coke vending machine has been viewed nearly 2.5 million times again on YouTube. This video was awarded CLIO\u2019s Prestigious Gold Interactive Award at the 51st annual dinner held in New York City this past May. This once again reminds us that there is nothing as good as authentic Coca-Cola stories of happiness, inclusion and optimism. Secondly, we are relentlessly focused on investing in our brands. Let me start by saying that now more than ever, we truly have momentum behind our brands. Not only is our brand equity strong and getting stronger, but we are also seeing this equity translate into solid results across both our sparkling and still brand offerings.  Sparkling beverages grew 3% in the quarter with international sparkling beverages case volume up 4%. Importantly for countries with per capita consumption under 150, our sparkling beverages grew 7% in the second quarter, underscoring our strength in these important gross markets. As for Coke Zero, it continues to be one of the fastest growing sparkling beverages in the world. In North America, Coke Zero delivered double-digit brand volume growth for the 17th consecutive quarter and across our top 22 markets, Coke Zero\u2019s share of the sparkling category is more than four times greater than the share of its primary competitor. We will keep placing the growth of our sparkling portfolio front and center in all of our 2010 plans. We are expanding our still beverages as well, with total still beverage unit case volume increasing 10% in the quarter, led by continued growth in juice and juice drinks, teas and water brands. In North America, Powerade is building on its 2009 momentum, growing high teens this past quarter, while once again gaining share. Consumers are clearly responding to the category leading innovations we have pioneered this past year, including the functional advantages provided in the Powerade\u2019s Ion4 formulation as well as the Zero calorie benefits of Powerade Zero. In fact, Powerade Zero continues to accelerate up 60% this past quarter alone and representing 15% of our year-to-date Powerade trademark volume in this important market. As for vitaminwater, we have a leading consumer engagement model that is building, continuing to build brand health. A great example of this is our flavor creator app on Facebook which encourage our consumers to design the newest vitaminwater flavor connect. These types of innovations have helped make vitaminwater one of the most popular beverages on Facebook with more fans than any of our primary competitor\u2019s flagship brands. I should mention that our recent launch of vitaminwater zero is yielding positive results. In fact, our entire set of premium Glaxo brands were up a combined 4% this past quarter in the United States.  Across the globe, the expansion and increased availability of vitaminwater is driving solid results in multiple markets. Year-to-date, international vitaminwater volume has reached 7 million unit cases or the equivalent of the brand size in the United States for the same period back in 2004. Though we anticipate continued global momentum for vitaminwater fuelled by a 360 degree integrated marketing plan which is now being executed in 15 international markets. In addition to vitaminwater, we are expanding across other key still categories.  In the juice category, we saw continuous solid results across the globe. For example, in North America, we once again gained volume and value share in the juice and juice drinks category with our chilled juice business growing 10% in the quarter and are simply trademarked delivering another quarter of double-digits growth. And finally, in the water category, our branded water business in the United States returned to growth with Dasani up 3% for the quarter. Also, this quarter, we launched Dasani in both Singapore as well as Malaysia. As we continue to grow and expand, we are fully committed to doing so in a sustainable manner living positively and responsibly in partnership with our consumers, with our customers and with our communities. This is why we were pleased to see the Coca-Cola Company receive high honors at the 22nd Annual DuPont Awards for packaging innovation. This prestigious DuPont award is the packaging industry\u2019s longest running independently judged global awards program, leading international industry and sustainability experts, judge entrance on their excellent and innovation sustainability and cost waste reduction. Our PlantBottle packaging earned one of five gold awards out of more than 160 global entrants for its breakthrough packaging innovation. Now, let me update you on the significant progress we have made in planning with a proposed integration of CCE\u2019s North America operations and Coca-Cola North America. Our integration, seasoned integration team is working hard to identify opportunities to operate more efficiently and to serve our customers more effectively. Our team also building plans to ensure smooth operations from day one. Further, we have begun the important work of creating a business model, an organizational structure that will support a new era of success in North America. We will provide further details on this model once the transaction closes. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter, in line with the time-line originally provided and we will provide updates as additional information becomes available. Let me close by saying that despite ongoing global economic headwinds, we are confident in our system\u2019s ability to win together to achieve our 2020 vision. And we remain intently focused on winning in 2010, growing volume, revenue, share and profits. Looking ahead, we have always said that there is no better consumer goods industry to be in than the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry.  As more consumers come into the middle class and emerging markets, and as consumers around the entire world search for new innovative ways to engage with their favorite brand, we believe that there is no better system investing more in these markets and providing meaningful innovations than the Coca-Cola Company. After all, the Coca-Cola Company is present in 206 markets, providing over 1.6 billion servings of refreshments each day through a global franchise system that engages with more than 20 million customers each week. Only the Coca-Cola Company has the world\u2019s greatest portfolio of beverage brands starting with our namesake brand, which keeps growing stronger each and everyday. And only the Coca-Cola Company is uniquely positioned to deliver quality results and returns both today and tomorrow. So while global economic pressures may continue in the short term, I can assure you that our company is doing all the right things to drive future sustainable growth and additional long-term shareowner value. So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gary.\nGary Fayard: Thank you Muhtar and good morning everyone. As Muhtar said, we delivered another quarter of consistent, sustainable and quality growth, gaining volume and value share both globally and across our key markets, with volume and profit results coming in ahead of our long term growth targets. These results reaffirm that we have the right leadership team in place with the right strategic plan, capabilities and executions to achieve our long term goals. As outlined in our release, we reported comparable earnings per share of $1.6, up 15% versus the prior year. Our comparable operating income was up a strong 15%, bringing our year-to-date comparable growth to 16%. Currency had a positive impact on operating income of 4% in the quarter and 6% year-to-date. For the quarter, our comparable gross profit was up 8%, bringing our year-to-date gross profit growth to 9%. Currency had a positive impact on gross profit of 2% in quarter and 4 percentage points year-to-date.  Further, our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 7% in the quarter, driven by 5% increase in concentrate sales and a 2% positive currency impact. Our total price mix for the quarter was even, in line with our expectations as our positive revenue growth management strategies, all except the expected ongoing impact of geographic mix. This improvement of our first quarter price mix results was fully consistent with what we indicated in our last earnings call when we said that we expected our price mix to be even for the full year. As for our cash flow from operations, this increased 18% year-to-date to $4.3 billion. This growth was primarily driven by our improved performance and including the positive effect of currency. Now let me go through some detail around our quarterly results and year-to-date trends. Our comparable currency neutral costs of goods was up 3% for the quarter and is now even year-to-date. As you may now recall on our last quarterly call, we said that we expected our cost of goods to grow in a low single-digit growth range for the full year and we still believe this expectation is appropriate. Comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were up 1% in the quarter and are net even year-to-date. Lastly, we captured five points of operating expense leverage in the quarter. As a reminder, when we speak of operating expense leverage, we are referring to the point difference, percentage point difference between our gross profit growth and our operating income growth on a comparable currency neutral basis. The percentage points captured this quarter were driven by our continued strong focus on cost management and the leveraging of our productivity initiatives. We also benefited from the favorable cycling of marketing expenses versus the prior year and we do expect that this will reverse in the back half of the year. As such, we anticipate our full year 2010 operating expense leverage to be at low single digits for the full year as we noted in our Q1 call. As for our total marketing expenses including both our direct and point of sale marketing, these continue to be positive in the quarter as we remain committed to investing in our brands for long term growth. Now let me build on Muhtar\u2019s earlier remarks regarding our pending transaction to acquire Coca-Cola Enterprise\u2019s North American operation. We have now achieved a number of important milestones and are on track with the remaining ones for our anticipated fourth quarter closing. First, On May 25th, Coca-Cola Enterprises filed its Form S4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company\u2019s first formal step towards seeking shareholder approval of the transaction. And amended Form-S4 was filed on July 8th to respond to the SEC\u2019s comments. The S4 provides details on the transaction and the [intended] new CCE business. The SEC must complete its review of the form S4 before the proxy statement that is contained within the S4 can be sent to CCE shareholders. Second on June 7th, the Coca-Cola Company announced disagreement with Dr Pepper Snapple for continued distribution of their brands after the transaction closes. Third, the transaction must receive antitrust clearance from the FTC as well as the Canadian Competition Bureau prior to closing and we submitted our request for antitrust approval on June 30th. As for CCE, they are awaiting a response to their request to the RAF for a revenue ruling approving to propose tax treatment and in addition, CCE shareholders must vote to approve the transaction. And with regard to these last two items, if you have any questions, I\u2019d refer you to CCE on those. But as Muhtar mentioned, we continue to expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter exactly in line with the timeline originally provided. We\u2019ll provide update on that. Finally, let me take a minute to provide how our outlook on a few key factors we see in the back half of 2010. Despite the recent volatility and some key currencies, we once again benefited from currency in the second quarter. This is consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter when we said that we believe the currencies would have a slightly positive impact on operating income on a full year basis with this benefit weighted towards the first half of this year. As such, we would expect currency to have a low single digit negative impact on operating income starting in the third quarter. As a quick reminder, we are 100% covered on the Euro 2010 and will continue to execute our hedging strategies over multiple years as appropriate. Also, want to remind you that as highlighted in our previous calls, our comparable results for this year reflect the impact of the deconsolidation, certain entities, primarily bottling operations due to new accounting guidance that became effective, the first of this year for the FASB requirements. For the full year 2009, these entities accounted for approximately 3% of our consolidated net revenue and approximately 2% of our consolidated operating income. In addition, we reflected these changes within our GAAP and non-GAAP schedules for about a comparable income statement for external modeling purposes.  At the end of the last quarter, we also posted a schedule in the investor section of our website that takes into account this change and accounting guidance to assist you in adjusting the prior year results. On productivity, we are on track and on plan to deliver the $500 million in annual savings from our initiatives by the end of next year 2011. And lastly, with regard to share repurchase as we said in our last call, we have to stay out of the market until the close of our transaction with Coca-Cola Enterprises while you will see minimal cash outflow for treasury stock purchases in our results this quarter. Note that these review the share withholding related to employee benefit plans. As for our plans to repurchased common stock, we remain committed to repurchasing at least $1.5 billion of shares by the end of this year.  In conclusion, while this is good to see some parts of the world experiencing a slow but steady recovery, it\u2019s clear that many others are continuing to struggle through an extended global recession. Despite this challenging global environment, our results this quarter as well as our continued track record of success this past year is a testament to our seasoned management team, our sound growth strategies and our solid global brand portfolio, we are clearly executing the right actions to drive our business for the long term.  We remain confident that we\u2019ll keep gaining global share and enhancing the health of our brands in order to drive long term profitable growth and importantly value for our shareholders. Operator, we are now ready for your questions.\nOperator:  Yes, thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Bill Pecoriello with Consumer Edge Research.\nBill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research: A question on China, you can help us understand some of the weight the various factors might be having in the slower sparkling volume growth. You mentioned the weather also slowing economy, was there any local price competition that resulted in volume share losses and also as you are monitoring shift in consumption habits between sparkling and strong still that you\u2019re reported? Thanks.\nMuhtar Kent: First, our volume in China grew 6% and importantly, we gained volume and value share in the total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages and it is important to I think remember that our 6% growth was off from a volume base that is more than two times the size of our global competitor, therefore widening our lead in terms of total unit cases, actual unit cases sold in China. And during the quarter again, and China is a complex market. We have a great portfolio in China. We grew our still beverages up by 30% gaining again volume and value share. And in sparkling beverages, we saw a sequential volume improvement through the quarter and I think also in June, sparkling value share gains as well as in the quarter.  So I expect to see continued sequential improvement in China. I think as I said China has had some very extraordinary weather in the first quarter, as well as some part in the strong markets on the East Coast in the second quarter. We clearly expect China to be a strong growth market for the company. I want to remind everyone of 26 quarters of, consecutive quarters of double digit growth that we\u2019ve had in China, a strong growth market, I think we all believe that China will be a strong growth market for the company for the next decade as well as beyond. And I can tell you that we will continue to do what is right for the business in China by investing for the long term and also leading the industry in building strong brands across our entire portfolio, especially in sparkling beverages.  And again, I just want to reiterate that we are investing $2 billion. We\u2019re in year two of that $2 billion investment. I was in China a couple of months ago at the opening of the Shanghai Expo. I\u2019m going to be back again for the opening of our new plant in Inner Mongolia or in China, bring our total number of plants very close to 40. We have a wonderful template above in terms of production as well as in terms of go-to-market, and I am confident that China as I said will continue to be a significant growth market for the company in the decades to come.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from UBS.\nKaumil Gajrawala - UBS: If you could drill down a little bit more into North America, specifically if you could give some context on channel mix and then also maybe a little more detail on what was behind the acceleration in still volume growth?\nMuhtar Kent: Well firstly, I want to just reiterate, Kaumil, that I am very very pleased with the fact that we are, we have generated a quarter of growth in our flagship market. We have been talking about all the programs in terms of brand price pack channel architecture that is beginning to yield. We have the scale now and the yield result. I talked about in the call about the success of the contour tool is a bottle of the portion control packaging of the new immediate consumption, both 14 and 16 ounce packages. I think, our brands are getting stronger in the United States, a significant strength in our brands are up, and therefore, I think we\u2019re seeing all of those culminate into results.  And it is particularly pleasing this that we are entering into our transaction that we intend to close in quarter four from a point of view of strength. That is really critically important that I want to reiterate. We delivered a solid quarter of volume, profit and share growth while staying again absolutely focused on our long term strategies. That is the key and we remain confident that we do have the right strategies for our flagship market, working closer than ever before, and our strategic focus remains consistent on continuing to build healthy brands, healthy customer relationships and healthy systems. And I think that we have all those and although they are getting stronger and therefore as I said, we\u2019re confident that the actions we\u2019re taking, have been taking in the last two years and taking today will only strengthen our future in North America, and that we are best positioned to capture the greatest value here in this market. \nGary Fayard: I\u2019d like to add one other thing that I think is really important as you look at the North American market. You heard us talking so much about the smaller packaging and recruitment. We are using that as a recruitment package over the last year or so and we\u2019re starting to really see it pay off, while we had extremely strong growth in our still brands. But just to see sparkling come back and be even in the quarter is great, but focus on brand Coke, brand Coca-Cola in North America was positive in growth this year and is because of the initiatives we have been putting behind that flagship brand that\u2019s going to really lead to success we think in North America.\nMuhtar Kent: I think the simple way to look at it just to finish off just the question Kaumil is that if you walk across into our North America operations or into any of our bottling partners operations in North America today, you will see a completely different belief in our sparkling brands and the belief that they will grow compared to three years ago. And I think that says it all. That is the belief that our people have at every level that they can generate growth out of this market because of the wonderful demographics that the strength of the brands, the spending power and also the consumption habits. And that there will be bumps along the road and of course, the consumer is still confused in the United States. There is still confusion out there in terms of the consumer spent levels, but we are moving on along the right path, that\u2019s the key message here.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: I guess Japan Muhtar, could you give us some more of a, some more color on the state of play through your vending business there and broaden that out as well and talk a bit about some of the other offsetting channel trends, not only in terms of any offsetting volumes you are getting from the weakness in vending, but also any efforts to improve profitability in these other channels?\nMuhtar Kent: First, Japan remains a very challenging environment. Everyone knows that. Our performance in this quarter was in line with our performance in Q1 and a sequential improvement of the last two quarters of 2009. Our business in Japan had also unfavorable weather in that part of the world that also hit the east coast of China. But overall, I think we are executing the right strategies and plans. We saw a sequential improvement in our business in the quarter that just passed, but we remained cautious because we expect the economic headwinds in Japan to continue in near term as well as throughout 2010. As far as the vending channel is concerned, yes, there has been, I think, we have seen the dip and there has been some improvement because its again, factories that basically close down during a period of time in the very depth of the recession are back albeit not working as on all shift that they used to but certainly, the export business coming back trademark Georgia is positive in vending, I mentioned that. I think we see some really good, still a great green shoots in trademark Coca-Cola and I mentioned about also innovation in packaging is helping us in Japan, but I think across all consumer goods industries in Japan, the outlook remains as we need to remain cautious but we are absolutely implementing the right strategies to ensure that our business is actually more healthy in Japan and also we can as the economy picks up that we will be ones that actually benefit the most in coming years. And we also, I have to say also that we are working absolutely diligently on the structural matters in Japan that will also aid our investment programs going forward.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: You are talking there when say structural, Muhtar, you are talking about the relationship with the bottlers and how the kind of route to market looks today versus future?\nMuhtar Kent:  Yes. That what\u2019s I\u2019m talking about, the [Canto] bottlers, I\u2019m talking about continuing to work with Coca-Cola, West Japan and ensuring that we do have the lowest cost production as well as route-to-market.\nOperator: And next is Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs:  Muhtar, just in terms of Europe and I just wanted to get a little bit better understanding in terms of the diversions and performance, between markets like France where you are showing high single digit growth and then you got obviously the southern part of Europe where trends are weak because the macros etcetera. So can you just give us a little bit more perspective on the trends that you are seeing and then maybe also talk about Great Britain in terms of your volume trend there, it sounds like the share trends have been a little bit softening in that market. Is that accurate and maybe just a little bit more color in some of the parts within Europe?\nMuhtar Kent: Look, I think I\u2019ve said this before Europe is like a tail of two cities. You\u2019ve got the East that is still challenged, very challenged, central and the East Europe is very challenged although Russia is beginning to show signs, the sun is beginning to comes through the clouds in Russia and Ukraine, which is really I think we look forward to seeing how that will progress, but certainly, I think the Western Europe, the economies, the consumer is better positioned, less confused and has a better outlook than the consumer in East and Central Europe and particularly also South Europe like Greece particularly as well as the former countries and the Former Yugoslavia as well as Italy.  So, that is the tale of two cities. So the South and the East being much more challenged from a consumer sentiment point of view than the west. And I think we saw some, again, improvement in trends in our business in Iberia, in France, the trademark Coca-Cola was very healthy in all of Western Europe, in the Benelux in England, generating growth in France of course and also in Iberia. So we were very encouraged with that and we had very very robust FIFA World Cup activation coming on with very integrated customer programs, as well as consumer programs related to the FIFA World Cup which our business also benefitted from.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Any color on UK in terms of your volume and share performance there? \nMuhtar Kent: Yeah. I don\u2019t want to comment any further on the UK for obvious better reasons right now. But I think that as I said to you, we were encouraged with the Coca-Cola trademark being up and also we successfully re-launched Diet Coke as well and that I think generated some strength for the trademark.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: And then Gary, just a quick follow up on currency. Obviously this year you talked about having 100% coverage on the Euro. As we think about 2011 and as you layer in the new hedges in places, is it fair to say that 2011, you would see a negative impact in terms of currency? \nGary Fayard: Judy, it\u2019s actually two early to tell because remember that the coverage we put on is an option strategy. So, if the Euro actually strengthened and it is been very volatile where we\u2019ve seen it hit a high, several month high in the last few days, it\u2019s hard to tell. So, I think it\u2019s one of those, I\u2019m going have to hold the answer until later this year we actually see where Euro really traits, but we are putting option, kind of coverage on so that we\u2019ll protect against downsize, but if in fact the Euro should strengthen, then it could be a positive. I just don\u2019t know yet. \nOperator: And next is John Faucher from JPMorgan Chase.\nJohn Faucher - JPMorgan Chase: Can you guys talk a little bit about the price mix number in the Pacific? It\u2019s been down for a couple of quarter so I kind of though it might get a little bit better this quarter as you cycled against an easier comparison. So can you give us a little bit of idea in terms of what\u2019s happening with that, is it a package mix issue within certain countries? Obviously, Japan is an issue in terms of being a higher price mix market. So, can you give us a little bit of an idea of what\u2019s going on there and kind of when we can expect that to get better as we continue to lap some easier comparisons? Thanks. \nMuhtar Kent: I\u2019ll let Gary answer that question in detail, but I mean, it is a question of mix that you said it\u2019s basically mix. We have the same mix, a similar mix in quarter one and I think I\u2019ll let Gary give you more granularity on that, John.\nGary Fayard: I\u2019d say it is a couple of things and this is where if I just start on total company first and then drill down to the Pacific specifically, remember we\u2019ve always said that we\u2019re going to have a negative geographic price mix. And that\u2019s a really good thing if you think about it and that it means that our emerging markets are growing much faster which is what we would want to happen, what you would want to happen than the more developed markets, and because of that, they just want to give us a negative geographic mix. That is accentuated in the Pacific where you\u2019ve got significant emerging markets. And so you have got the Philippines up, strong double-digit, you\u2019ve got Thailand up strong double-digit, you\u2019ve got Indonesia up strong double-digits. And then at a time when Japan is down three and Australia is actually down two, and you put those together and you\u2019ve got significant geographic negative mix that is more than offsetting pricing whereas for total company, we\u2019re able to balance that out as what we always said from a total company, total global portfolio perspective. We should be able to balance that out longer term, make it actually positive.  But basically, as geographic mix in the Pacific, it over time will get smaller. If you remember that if you went back even five years ago, Japan was probably 20% of the total profit, it\u2019s now in single digits. And because of that, it is getting smaller. Now, we were working diligently on Japan so and I really would love it to be bigger obviously. But the geographic mix is the big thing. But one other thing I had in Japan is kind of back to one of the previous questions as well. On two of the bottlers in the Canto area, we took management control a year to two years ago and they actually had a really good quarter and we are actually positive and it\u2019s just giving I think all the bottlers in Japan something now to understand what\u2019s actually possible with.  And so we\u2019re using that in best practices to really show what\u2019s possible in Japan and I think a longer time we have positive view on Japan.\nJohn Faucher - JPMorgan Chase: Okay. So, just one quick follow-up on that, in terms of managing expectations for Pacific going forward, operating profit on a currency neutral basis I think is been down. Is it safe to say, is it just simply a re-acceleration of China or is it something where you are going to say look, for the foreseeable future, expect sort of minimal organic top line growth and minimal profit growth from Pacific. It\u2019s a longer term engine of growth, but shorter term, not so much.\nGary Fayard: John, I think that is very well put. Short term, not so much, but longer term definitely one of the real engines of growth.\nOperator: And next is Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment Research.\nWendy Nicholson - Citi Investment Research: First of all, in North America, can you talk about the food service channel a little bit? What you are seeing there and what\u2019s happening in terms of the timing of the roll out of the 500 Freestyle machines, how much of an impact that\u2019s going to have on the top line?\nMuhtar Kent: Wendy, we don\u2019t break the food service up, but I do want to say that the Freestyle is something that we are excited about. I often go to visit myself restaurants and customer partners that operates the Freestyle machine and I think that basically currently, we have said that we are pilot testing in restaurants, right here in Atlanta, Dallas, Southern California. We have plans for Orlando and Chicago to come in.  And again, we expect that there\u2019d be probably around couple of thousand machines in the market by the year-end and the big innovation that we have, we see great consumer acceptance, excitement and we see customer excitement with the Freestyle and we believe that this will benefit our business in addition to everything else we are doing with our brands in North America. This will benefit our business going forward. It is again, want to stress that it is a long term play and we will see benefits of this in the decade, in the years to come and the next decade in our vision period.\nWendy Nicholson - Citi Investment Research: And do you think that Freestyle helps you gain distribution in new food service outlet or is it just to replacing the traditional fountain machines you already have?\nMuhtar Kent: Firstly, I think there is a tremendous vertical play here. So, inside the existing customer base, you need to understand that this will give us vertical volume gains. There is higher transactions and higher volume. Additionally, we believe that again, this will be an opportunity to even also gain horizontal expansion.\nWendy Nicholson - Citi Investment Research: Go it. And if I just have one quick follow up on Europe. Even though the macro environment is obviously very challenged and the top line is under pressure, the margins have held up surprisingly well. Do you think that\u2019s an area and Gary, you talked about a shift in the timing of some of the investment spending, is that an area that\u2019s going to see more spending in the back half or is there something structural or they just making out business, higher margin and saw pretty good actual profit growth this quarter?\nMuhtar Kent: It wasn\u2019t very high margin business to start with and we have been diligently working to ensure that we can keep those margins as we grapple with the macroeconomic challenges, but I think I\u2019ll let also Gary talk about the marketing spend levels that you asked about.\nGary Fayard: What I say on marketing, remember, total company in fact, there because of what we are cycling in the prior year the way, we record marketing expenses, marketing will be up much more in the second half of the year than the first half, strictly as the way of how we reported and our, what we are cycling. That will be most exaggerated and emphasized actually in Europe, where there will be a significant increase in marketing expenses in the second half of this year.\nOperator:  And next is Lauren Torres with HSBC.\nLauren Torres - HSBC: Muhtar, you touched upon Russia. I was curious to get your comments on how that markets change. We saw some great growth this quarter in comparison to weakness over the last several quarters, just curious if you feel that as a result of your initiative or is just a better help coming back to that market, something that we haven\u2019t seen for last year or so?\nMuhtar Kent:  Well, my 30 plus years of experience with, at that time with the Soviet Union and then, later in the last 20 years with Russia has always been that it is very volatile, it goes into a deep economic issue consumers, sentiment issues very quickly and it comes out very quickly. And I think we are seeing, I see what\u2019s happening in Russia pretty similar to what happened back in 1998, when it went into a deep crisis and then came out again towards, end of 1999. So obviously, the reasons are not the same but the way the consumer is reacting, the way the customers are reacting is very similar.  However, I want to stress that what we are doing with brand Coca-Cola, up 19% in Russia in the last quarter is definitely a result of the success of our own marketing initiatives than working very closely with our bottling partner Coca-Cola Hellenic.\nLauren Torres - HSBC: So do you feel that 6% growth rate is sustainable going forward? You could kind of build from there or is it just somewhat reflected to those initiatives that help the quarter?\nMuhtar Kent: Based on my own personnel prior experience with Russia, I believe that we will continue to see growth in Russia coming, although again, there is a tremendous amount of volatility in Russia are names, two names that actually go together. \nOperator:  I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Muhtar Kent. \nMuhtar Kent:  Thank you, Gary and Jackson. In closing, we had a very good second quarter, and are confident about our company today, and also where we are on our path to 2020. We continue to generate strong cash flow, remain committed to re-deploying that cash to both growing our business as well as rewarding our share owners. We are investing alongside our system to win around the globe. At the same time, we are committed to delivering consistent value to our share owners through regular dividend payment and share re-purchase programs.  We will drive a fast and seamless integration effort in North America, and bring increased value and profitability to this important critical region. We will execute flawlessly on our 2020 vision by working very closely with our bottlers, our employees and all our key stakeholders. We see a tremendous opportunity ahead for the Coca-Cola Company in all of our markets and geographies.  We remain intently focused on working across our system to execute our key strategic priorities and to generate long term sustainable growth. Thank you for joining us this morning.\nOperator:  And that concludes today\u2019s call, thank you for your participation.

(Operator Instructions) I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors. And therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations Department if they have questions. I would like to now introduce Jackson Kelly, Vice President and Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Kelly, you may begin.\nJackson Kelly: Good morning and thank you for being with us again today. I am joined by Muhtar Kent, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Fayard, our Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report. In addition, I would also like to note that we have posted schedules on our company website at www.thecoca-colacompany.com under the Reports and Financial Information tab and in the Investors section, which reconciles certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to by our senior executives in our discussion this morning and from time to time in discussing our financial performance through our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Please look on our website for this information. With that, let me now turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that I am very pleased with our first quarter results. We once again delivered consistent, profitable and sustainable growth inspired by our 2020 Vision and also fueled by our innovation and global reach. Despite ongoing challenges in global economic conditions, we continued to invest in our business and build our brands, while generating strong and also steady cash flow. We are competing and winning around the world as one company with our global bottling partners, leveraging our unique scale as well as the increased presence of our brands. As we announced earlier this quarter, we are taking decisive actions to strategically advance our North America business and further strengthen our franchise system in Europe. We remain confident in our ability to execute our 2020 vision, thus laying the foundation for consistent, long term, sustainable growth. As I have mentioned on numerous occasions, we see tremendous growth opportunities for our system and for the entire nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry over the next ten years and beyond. This past quarter, despite the lingering effects of the global recession, we delivered solid 9% operating income growth on a comparable currency neutral basis. Overall, global economic unit case volume grew a strong 3% with a significant number of international markets fueling this growth. Our growth in countries with a per capita of less than 150 was an exceptional 10%. Let me take a moment to share in more detail our performance across our international markets. In Eurasia and Africa, we saw broad-based growth of 11%. This increase was led by India, up a strong 29%, and cycling 31%, making this our seventh consecutive quarter of double digit growth in this fast-growing nation. And while sustaining this high growth rate in India in the coming months will likely depend on weather patterns during the upcoming monsoon season, we are confident in our ability to deliver consistent double digit growth for the balance of this year. We also saw double digit growth in Turkey, Northwest Africa, Southern Eurasia, and the Middle East. Notably, we are beginning to see sequential improvement in Russia, which was down 1%, led by the strong performance of brand Coca-Cola, which grew 12% and gained share this quarter in Russia. Latin America maintained its steady and consistent performance, up 4% overall, driven by strong 12% growth in Brazil. Our Latin Center unit was up double digits, led by Columbia which grew 19%, while our South Latin unit was up mid-single digits. Mexico, impacted by unseasonably cold weather was down 2%. But as the weather has improved, this trend has reversed, with our business generating positive growth in the month of March and despite these weather challenges in the quarter, we continue to gain total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage share in Mexico, driven by both our sparkling and our still beverages. Our Pacific Group continued to expand up 5% in total, and led by double digit growth across Korea, Indonesia, and several other markets. Our volume performance in Japan was a sequential improvement on our performance in the last two quarters, down 3%. Despite ongoing economic headwinds, we are experiencing steady improvement in the clinical vending channel as well as strong results in the convenience store channel. This led to better performance for our Georgia Coffee business. Our trademark Coca-Cola brands in Japan keep widening the gap against our primary competitor led by Coca-Cola Zero, which was up 24% for the quarter. In fact, since 2005, we have grown trademark Coca-Cola incremental unit case volume in Japan five times more than our main competitor has grown its trademark brands over the same period. And I LOHAS, our fast-growing, eco-friendly natural mineral water brand launched last May is building on its market share leadership. In less than a year, it has become the number one packaged water brand in Japan. China unit case volume grew 6%, including double-digit growth in the latter half of the quarter. This performance comes on the heels of a strong fourth quarter and a great finish to 2009, which was led by growth across our portfolio as well as new product launches. Over the past six months, our volume grew a solid 16%. And while we may see volume strengths from quarter-to-quarter, the 16% growth over the past six months was ahead of our primary international competitor. For perspective, our China business has generated more than $100 million incremental unit cases this past six months and continues to be twice the size of our primary international competitor on an annual basis. And we are building momentum across our entire portfolio. We are advancing our sparkling business in China behind strong innovations such as the launch of Spritea, which taps into the combined popularity of green tea and Sprite. We're expanding our winnings to beverage business through the ongoing growth of our industry-leading juice and juice drink beverages and our Minute Maid Pulpy Super Milky dairy brand. And we are kicking off an exciting new Yuan Ye led tea portfolio, launching in Yuan Ye Jasmine Tea. And as we have shared before, we're just getting started in China and remain resolute in our commitment to invest for solid long-term growth. Now, moving to Europe. Despite the continuation of difficult economic conditions in Europe, our unit case volume growth was even for the quarter. This was an improvement over our 2009 full year results with growth across France, Belgium, the Netherlands and North Central Europe. Further, our company-owned bottlers in Europe grew well ahead of the region with Germany up mid-single digits and Nordics up low-single digits, as we build towards re-franchising both of these operations. In the United Kingdom, we were pleased that our trademark Coca-Cola brands became the first to top the \u00a31 billion mark in annual U.K. grocery retail sales. We are excited about our recently announced increased investments in Innocent, reflecting our belief in the long-term growth potential of the smoothie business. Lastly and in alignment with our 2020 Vision, we recently reorganized our Europe business from 10 business units to four, making it easier for us to do business with our bottlers as well as partners as we gain significant scale, speed and simplicity. In total, these international performance results are a testament to our seasoned operating team, which is executing our 2020 Vision quickly and also with great discipline. I can assure you that our strategy and focus to build the long-term equity of our brands remains decisively clear. This focus is reflected in the volume and value share gains we continue to realize together with our bottling partners around the world. As a system, we are pulling together to communicate with our consumers, invest in our brands and build for a better tomorrow. Now, let me briefly explain each of these actions. First, communicating with our consumers. Last quarter, I highlighted some of the important global platforms we're leveraging in 2010 to communicate and connect with consumers around the world. We just concluded our successful Vancouver Olympics program, which helped improve trademark Coca-Cola brand equity scores with Teen in Canada. And these improvements are flowing to the bottom-line as we've grown dollar share for trademark Coca-Cola and system revenue in Canada to their highest levels in years. Meanwhile, our FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour carries on with its journey all around the world. The tour has now traveled to 27 international markets, engaging thousands of consumers and earning an average of $2 million of media value in each and every country visited. In addition, we are finding new and innovative ways to leverage our FIFA World Cup platform to more effectively communicate with consumers. For example, we launched Powerade's first ever global marketing campaign, which includes an innovative online experience. A series of digital films highlight the functional benefits of Powerade and also showcase a never-ending football game played around the world. This campaign has already launched on YouTube in Brazil, Mexico, Italy, Spain and 16 more countries. We're also teaming up with customers around the world to bring the passion and the excitement of the FIFA World Cup to life for our consumers. A great example is the marketing program we developed together with Wal-Mart. By using a jointly produced global toolkit, we will drive incremental sales for Wal-Mart and our company, while making the excitement of the World Cup more affordable and accessible for everyday fans. Finally, as the global partner of the 2010 world exposition in Shanghai, we expect to host over 100 million visitors from China and around the world at our Coca-Cola Happiness Factory pavilion, engaging consumers, customers and other key global stakeholders through an extensive marketing program that will be executed during this exciting 184-day event. So these are just a few examples of how we are connecting directly with our consumers across many, many nations in a way that only our company with our global footprint can do. Secondly, we are relentlessly focused on investing in our brands. Let me start with sparkling beverages, where I have already highlighted some of the many countries where we experienced sparkling growth this quarter. Brand Coca-Cola grew in line with our worldwide volume. Coca-Cola unit case volume grew over 1 million unit cases in 24 different countries. We were very proud to see Diet Coke for the first time since its introduction tie for the Number 2 brand position amongst all sparkling brands in the United States behind only Coca-Cola, as reported in Beverage Digest last month. As for Coca-Cola Zero, it is still driving growth for us in every operating group, increasing double digits for the sixteenth consecutive quarter in North America, and 7% on a worldwide basis. Just like we said in our recent investor event, we intend to keep growing trademark Coca-Cola, the epicenter of our business in 2010 and well beyond, and we're building on our track record, successfully introducing cross-category innovations by launching several new beverages including Spritea in China, which I mentioned earlier, as well as Fanta White a new sparkling, lactic drink, which will launch in Japan next week. We are innovating and expanding our still beverages as well. We are launching new brand extensions across multiple markets such as Vitaminwater Zero in North America, and Minute Maid Nimbu Fresh Lemonade in India. Both are gaining great momentum and traction. We are expanding our successful innovations across borders such as our Pulpy juice drink innovation, created under the Minute Maid trademark in the Pacific and now also available under the Del Valle trademark in Latin America. Altogether, our Pulpy brands are now present in 12 countries. We also have plans in place to take Hugo, our juice and dairy innovation launched in Chile last year, into other markets in Latin America later this year. We are leveraging best-in-class programs across borders, as in the case of Vitaminwater, where we are implementing a fully integrated 360 degree summer program in almost all of our international markets. We are leveraging best practices from Canada, Great Britain, Japan, and Mexico to ensure excellence, consistency, and impact for this great brand. Thirdly, we are building for a better tomorrow, and are fully committed to growing in a sustainable and responsible way in partnership with our consumers, customers, and communities. To the benefit of all our consumers, we are working in partnership with the First Lady of the United States on a program to end childhood obesity in a generation. We have announced our clear, on calories commitment in support of this special effort. While I already highlighted an example of how we work in partnership with global customers, in the end, the proof is in the results. That is why we were particularly pleased to see our business with our top ten global retail customers grow mid-single digits in volume, and double digits in revenue in 2009 ahead of our total company growth. Lastly, a great example of our efforts to support our communities is our launch of Odwalla's Haiti Hope Mango juice drink in the United States. 100% of the profits of this beverage will go to support the development of a sustainable food industry, and thousands and thousands of families in Haiti. As we build these relationships for the future, stakeholders from around the world are recognizing our performance. In the past few weeks, we've been honored to receive several acknowledgements; Fortune Magazine ranked us number 10 in their annual list of the world's most admired companies; number one overall in beverages and number one across multiple beverage industry attributes including innovation, financial standards, and social responsibility. Paris Interactive ranked us number eight on their annual list of most admired U.S. companies, as well as in the top five in vision and leadership, as well as financial performance. Corporate Social Responsibility magazine ranked their 100 best corporate citizens for 2010, and rated us at number eight, ahead of all other beverage companies. And just this week, Business Week moved us up in their annual ranking of the world's most innovative companies, positioning us as the most innovative consumer goods company in the world. Our eco-friendly Aloha's bottle was recognized by both the Asian Marketing Effectiveness Festival, where we won their Platinum Award, and Japan's Ministry of Environment, which awarded us with their grand prize for Global Environment. Wal-Mart named us their Supplier of the Year in China, while 7-Eleven's franchise system did the same in North America. Same in North America, our volume results declined 2% for the quarter, consistent with our 2009 results. Our unit case volume for sparkling beverages declined 1% in the quarter in North America, showing sequential improvement. Our still beverages were down 2% for the quarter, although we were able to still hold value share. Importantly, our newest billion-dollar brand simply grew 26% in the quarter, while strong Powerade activity, driven by effective NCAA March Madness programs helped drive volume and value share gains in the sports drinks category. Now let me turn to our biggest news of the quarter and update you on the great progress we've made since announcing our intention to acquire CCE's North America business. As previously announced, we have appointed Brian Kelley to lead the integration of the Coca-Cola Company's and CCE's North American operations. Brian's integration team announced internally last week, consistent leaders from both the Coca-Cola Company and CEE whose operations credentials and knowledge of the North American market is second to none. I have the utmost confidence that this team will deliver on our integration goals. Earlier today, we also announced our post-integration leadership team for North America. Steve Cahillane, currently President of the North American business unit for CCE will assume the role of President and Chief Executive Officer of the new Coca-Cola Refreshments once the company's acquisition of CCE North America is successfully concluded. Sandy Douglas will continue as President of Coca-Cola North America. Both Steve and Sandy who have executed very effectively and in concert with each other for the past two years will report directly to me. This will be the first time ever that our North American bottling can, fountain and juice businesses will be produced, marketed and sold by an integrated 21st century service organization. We're truly excited by this prospect. And as I've said before, we are taking decisive actions in North America from a position of strength. I am excited that both Steve and Sandy who have been so instrumental in driving positive change in North America have agreed to lead our efforts to capture the great opportunity that this important marketplace has to offer. Let me reiterate my fundamental view about our business in North America. Growing here is not optional. It is essential to the health and future of our entire global system. As you look at the external forces shaping our 2020 Vision, especially changing demographics, North America is at the height of many of these trends. The U.S. population is growing and will increase by over 30 million by 2020, outpacing the absolute population gains of fast-growing countries like Brazil, Egypt, and Indonesia. With over 30 million teams in 2020, the team population of the United States is projected to be greater than that of Brazil, Mexico, Egypt, and Vietnam. Clearly, there is great opportunity in our North America business across our entire portfolio, and particularly with trademark Coca-Cola. Today, our favorite brand scores are higher than they have been in over a decade. We believe, innovative marketing, merchandizing, strong execution, and clear communications will be the key to restoring trademark Coca-Cola growth in North America, just like we were able to successfully bring back growth to Coke in Japan and the United Kingdom. The acquisition of CCE's North American business and the refranchising of our European operations are consistent with our 2020 vision. This evolution in our business will give us the financial flexibility and marketing and distribution leadership required to accelerate our business in North America and Western Europe, while also strengthening the long term health of our franchise system. As we work to create the world's premier, low cost, and effective beverage manufacturing and distribution business, one with a fully empowered and centralized national sales organization, we are confident these actions will result in greater value for our shareholders. Let me close by saying that it is clear that consumers are not yet out of this crisis and still remain confused due to the extended economic headwinds around the world. Therefore, given this environment, there still may be bumps along the way this year and we may continue to experience some quarter to quarter volatility. That said, we confidently stand behind our long term growth targets and intend to keep winning together in 2010, growing volume, share, and profits. As we look ahead, we firmly believe that there is no better business to be in than the nonalcoholic, ready-to-drink beverage industry, and we remain intently focused on creating shareholder value. With that let me now turn the call over to Gary.\nGary Fayard: As Muhtar indicated, we're off to a good start in 2010, delivering consistent, sustainable, and quality volume and profit growth in line with our long term growth targets. Our first quarter results are a clear indication that we have the right leadership in place with the right strategic plans and capabilities to achieve these goals. One quick reminder and as highlighted during our last earnings call, our comparable results for this quarter reflect the impact of the deconsolidation of certain entities, primarily bottlers, due to changes in accounting guidance as per FASB requirements. To facilitate comparisons, we will post details of all these adjustments by quarter on our Investor Relations website later this week. As outlined in our release, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.80, up 23% versus prior year. For the quarter, comparable currency neutral operating income was up 9%. Further, our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 7%, driven by a 3% increase in concentrate sales and a 6% positive currency impact, partially offset by geographic mix. As anticipated and as we indicated in our last earnings call, we continue to see many of our emerging markets recovering from the global recession at a quicker rate than our developed markets, resulting in continued pressure on our geographic or country mix at a consolidated level. This is a natural outcome for a company like ours with such an extensive global footprint. At the same time, we effectively executed our revenue growth management initiatives to realize positive pricing. This enabled us to grow global value share for the 11th consecutive quarter, while maintaining global volume share for the quarter. These results reflect our continued effort, focus and commitment to win in every market as we come out of this global crisis. Our objectives remain steadfast, strengthen the health of our brands and drive share gains. We anticipate that our positive revenue strategies will be offset by geographic mix. Therefore, as we said in the last earnings call, we expect our price mix to be even for the full year. As we also said in that call, we would expect to see a return to positive price mix over the long term as the global consumer sentiment steadily improves. As for our cash flow from operations, this increased 52% in the quarter to $1.3 billion. This growth was primarily driven by our improved performance and the cycling of a pension fund being of about $200 million in the prior year. Now, let me explain some of the factors impacting our quarterly results and full year trends. Our comparable currency neutral cost of goods was down 3% for the quarter as a result of the shifts in mix. On a full-year basis, we would expect our cost of goods to grow at a more normalized, low single digit range. Comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were down 1% in the quarter. This reflects the timing of marketing expenses, and it also reflects the continued benefits of our productivity initiatives which we've pursued on an ongoing basis for the past two-and-a-half years. We anticipate our full year operating expense leverage will come in the low-single digits. Next, I want to call out two items related to North America, first related to the CCE transaction. Our integration planning has progressed quickly and in an orderly fashion under the leadership of Brian Kelley and his team. As Muhtar mentioned before, we're excited about the continued leadership both of Steve Cahillane and Sandy Douglas that they will bring to our North American business. As for the approval process for the transaction, we've not experienced any delays and still expect an early fourth quarter close. Second and as part of our ongoing work to strengthen our economic profits in North America, we've made a strategic decision to exit the low-margin retail spring water segment of the water category. Accordingly, we have eliminated the retail spring and customer brand water volume from our reported volume for both 2010 and 2009. This change did not have any impact on either the company or North America's reported volume results this quarter. Now, let me take a moment to provide our outlook on some of the other key factors we see impacting this year. As expected, we benefited form currency in the first quarter. We still believe currencies will have a slightly positive impact on our operating income for the full year with its benefit weighted towards the first half of the year. On productivity, we'll try to deliver $500 million in annual savings from our initiatives by the end of 2011. And lastly, with regards to share repurchase, let me reaffirm that while we are out of the market until we close the transaction with CCE, we're still committed to repurchasing at least $1.5 billion of the company's stock in 2010. In conclusion, while we're just beginning to emerge form the global recession and expect the recovery to be moderate as consumer outlooks only improves, our seasoned management team is clearly taking the right actions, executing the right strategies in this global environment to drive our business for the long term and build on our track record of success. We remain confident, and will continue gaining global share while enhancing the health of our brands in order to drive long term profitable growth and value for our shareholders. Operator, we're now ready for questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Bill Pecoriello with Consumer Edge Research.\nBill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research: Gary, I just wanted to follow up on the price mix. You still see it even on the full year. So just looking at Q1, was it just a matter of some of the timing and the lapse? I know it's your toughest compare. You're having 2 % price mix from a year ago, and then it deteriorated as the year went on. But if you could help us understand how much the geographic mix versus underlying price or product mix impacted the quarter, and why it's getting better balance of year? Again, is it just the comps? Thanks.\nGary Fayard: A couple of different things; one is what we're cycling, but more importantly, it is a combination of a couple of things. One is that obviously we are getting significant growth from our emerging markets, and when those markets which are lower margin grow faster, you are going to get some negative pressure from geographic mix. At the same time, our pricing mix was actually positive in the quarter. But the other impact that is totally timing and giving me a lot of confidence of where we'll come back even for the full year is that as I look at the different markets around the world and I look at the timing of gallon shipments of concentrate, well, while gallons and cases were pretty much in line for the quarter, within certain high margin countries, Japan, the U.S., South Africa for example, the gallons were behind cases. This is a quarter where normally the bottlers would be stocking up getting ready for the summer season. Those are natural timings; those will reverse, and so that gives me a lot of confidence that as we look at the price mix, it's going to come back we think even for the full year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Marc Greenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMarc Greenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities: My question relates to Japan, which has been soft for some time. I appreciate that you're gaining share and that new products are driving volumes, but trends still remain negative. How should we think about the longer term expectations for Japan, and how might that impact the mix over time for the portfolio?\nGary Fayard: I think no question that Japan remains a very challenging environment from a macroeconomic point of view, but also from a demographic point of view. Also, we have a tremendous business in Japan, tremendous partners in Japan, and we are, as you know busy trying to leverage the scale in Japan and trying to put together productivity measures in Japan that we can then refocus on further investments in our brands. So I expect Japan to be remain challenged, but I think we see some improvements in the at-work market in Japan, in the vending channel in Japan, compared to lets say 8, 9, 10 months ago. We are gaining share in Japan, typically in the very critical ready-to-drink coffee segment category. Sparkling beverages are very healthy in Japan. Coca-Cola Zero continues to do really well. Also, some new product introductions also continue to do very well. It's a very complex market. Coca-Cola Zero, as I said was up at about 24%. But you can look at Japan in the following mindset; Japan will remain challenged, but we expect that there will be some sequential improvements going forward.\nOperator:  And next is Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment Research. \nWendy Nicholson \u2013 Citi Investment Research:  Could you talk about the shift in the timing of the marketing spending that you referred to in North America? I was surprised by that, given the Olympics and the Super Bowl. So, where is the incremental on higher level of spending coming over the balance of the year and how significant is that?\nGary Fayard:  You know that we're on a sales curve, and so we recognize marketing over the year. Really, what you are seeing the impact in the first quarter is that the way our marketing was spread last year, it's what we're cycling. So, you're seeing the reported marketing pretty much even in the quarter, but it's going to be up in the mid-single digits or more for the year. So you will see that shift starting in Q2, Q3, and Q4, but is really a matter of what we're cycling and nothing more than that.\nWendy Nicholson \u2013 Citi Investment Research: And in terms of the mix of the spending, obviously I assume you are spending heavily behind simply. But where else is incremental spending coming over the balance of the year?\nGary Fayard: Well, again, we're spending right of what we had budgeted to spend. It's really how it's being recorded and what we're cycling versus the prior year. So we're having marketing increases in spending across all the geographies around the world. The largest increases obviously would have been in Vancouver with the Olympics, but particularly the summer with FIFA World Cup, but that's in the spread as well across here.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala. Your line is open. He is with UBS.\nKaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Yes, with UBS. I guess two questions. First, roughly 2% impact on revenues from the accounting changes. That's roughly what we should expect for the rest of the year. And then a second question on productivity, how much of it was in the quarter and how far along are you? Obviously, you're confident in hitting $500 million by the end of 2011. But how far have we gone down so far?\nMuhtar Kent: Hello, Kaumil. Let me just talk in reference to productivity, and then I'll pass on to Gary about the first part of your question. On productivity, I think we're seeing the benefits of not just these past few months of work, but also the work that we've put into place over the last 24, even 30 months. And this is obviously very long term, but also very important and effective project. And I'd say that we are on target with realizing our goals through 2010, but also putting into place all the necessary work that will ensure that we realize also our goals in 2011. And as you know, the target is $500 million by 2011.\nGary Fayard: And on the accounting changes, Kaumil, that's why I mentioned that we're going to put details out by quarter and for the year out on the website later this week. And what we realize is some people when they had modeled it, didn't get it exactly right. So it is 3% impact in the quarter of consolidated revenues, but then there is a net of company elimination. So it's actually 2% net of the eliminations, 2% percent on operating income and 0% at pre-tax income or net income. So you come back to exactly the same place. But it was about $115 million reduction in net revenue in the quarter from the deconsolidation of those bottles.\nOperator: And next is Christine Farkas with Bank of America.\nChristine Farkas - Bank of America: I'm hoping to dive into North America a little bit. Correct me if I am wrong, but this is the first quarter I've seen where sparkling outperformed still beverages, and I'm wondering if mix had something to do with your margin improvement or if there were other factors. And speaking to the still beverages, certainly cycling a strong Powerade comp, but can you talk about some of the other non-water still beverages and the performance in the quarter?\nMuhtar Kent: Thanks, Christine. You're right in pointing that out, and I think that we're also pleased with that. And that is the testimony to not only, again, work that's been done in this past quarter, but the work that we've been doing in our brands strengthening our brands, particularly sparkling brands, the investments that are going into sparkling brands for the last year-and-a-half. And again, our brand metrics for our sparkling brands are healthier than we've seen them in many, many years. Coca-Cola Zero, again, had a very, very strong quarter in the United States. And again, still tremendous room to grow in the United States going forward. So I think packaging is working. Our 99-cent single-serve is working. The contourization, as is now, in more than 50% of the country and getting tremendous distribution coverage is working very well. So all those programs that we'd put into place last year and even at the end of 2008 are beginning to bear fruit. So that's why we see an improving landscape in the sparkling category in the United States and all brands in that category. As far as still beverages are concerned, I think sports Powerade, again, cycling a very strong prior-year quarter, a double digits growth from last year, grew this year, which was very pleasing. We, I think, gained volume and value share in the juice and juice drinks category as expansion of Simply Orange in both packaging and cold channel led to another quarter of double-digit growth, which was very pleasing. And again, we also made the strategic decision to exit the lower-margin retail spring water segment of the water category. And accordingly, we've eliminated the retail spring and customer brand water volume from our reported results for 2010 as well as 2009. And I can reiterate that this change did not impact either the company's or our North America's reported volume results this quarter. And again, I think vitaminwater, we're very excited with the changes we've made. New product innovation of vitaminwater Zero as well as packaging, as well as the advertising. And we expect to deliver stronger results through the balance of the year with, again, that strong brand. Our energy brand NOS continued to grow very effectively in the quarter as well as also our Smartwater. So I think overall, those are the sort of important points that I'd like to make about our North American business that you asked Christine.\nChristine Farkas - Bank of America: Muhtar, I'm just wondering if on the Philippines the momentum has continued, and you saw positive growth in the first quarter?\nMuhtar Kent: I'll say that I think all the hard work that our (BIG) group is doing in the Philippines is beginning to pay dividends, and I'm pleased, although not excited because I think there is still room for improvement.\nOperator: And next is Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Muhtar, one is a quick follow up in terms of North America. You've talked about sparkling being down 1% in the fourth quarter. How much of that (is just) really category getting better and maybe you can talk about your volume and value share performance, specifically in sparkling in North America in the quarter?\nMuhtar Kent: We have certainly had good results in our value share in North America in sparkling and I'm pleased with that. It's too early to say whether the category is beginning to improve. All I can tell you is that our Food Service business, our fountain business, which is a great litmus test for consumer sentiment, we saw some improvement in the latter half of the quarter. But again, as I referenced to Christine's question, it's really important to understand that these packaging changes, and also our Open Happiness campaign, our branding, our connection with the Olympics property in the quarter, all of that played very well into our brands. Again, our brands are getting healthier; our packaging as I said is working; 50% coverage in the entire United States on our contourization for two liter. The pricing of two liter, again, versus the single serves are in a much better place than it was back 18 months ago. All of that is beginning to show. The logic of all of that is beginning to pay dividends.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: And then, just in terms of Europe, Germany, clearly, second quarter in a row where volume was up pretty nicely here. Can you talk about what's been driving the improvement in that market? And then moving to the U.K., the weather was not really great in that market in the first quarter. So, how did volume do in terms of The U.K., because I don't think you gave us the volume number for the U.K. market?\nMuhtar Kent: U.K. was slightly down. But I think really important to understand is about Germany. What is happening in Germany, it's got nothing to do with this past quarter or this past year. Germany was not a market that needed to be fixed; Germany, as you know, it took us years to try to ensure that we could put the right structure in Germany. We closed the deal finally in 2006, and we've been busy putting ourselves to work to get Germany right. So it's really important to understand that this is not a program that suddenly came into being last quarter or last year. We've been working on getting Germany right. Is Germany right? I'd say probably more than certainly 50% right, and I am confident that looking into the future, Germany is going to start yielding some good dividends as we move towards franchising Germany in the period that we've announced.  But thinking along the same lines as what we are doing in the United States, these are long term programs that we commit ourselves to fixing major markets. Germany was a big one internationally, and now we see that it's on the way to repair and it's going to be finding the right home.\nOperator: And the next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan Chase.\nJohn Faucher - JPMorgan Chase: Quick question; on the North America volume, I apologize for following up on this. Muhtar, you said it didn't affect the loss of the spring water business, didn't affect the volume numbers. Is that because you excluded it from both years, or was that because it was so small that it was less than 1%?\nMuhtar Kent: Well, because we excluded it from both years. But Gary can give you some more details on that. The answer is, we excluded it from both years.\nGary Fayard: John, we excluded it from both years, but it's very small and did not impact the volume growth rate of North America at all. On a full year basis, it's less than 1% of North America.\nJohn Faucher - JPMorgan Chase: Then going back to the Japan question that Mark had; you talked about the strength of CSDs. How much of the price mix issue in Asia is related to lower non-carb volumes, this strategic push into CSDs, and the channel mix that entails. And I guess, is that one of the mix problems that we should expect to improve over the next couple of quarters, or is that one going to take a little bit longer? Thanks.\nMuhtar Kent: John, I think it's more related also to the channel in Japan, and the channel was under tremendous pressure this time last year and remained under tremendous pressure for all of 2009. And as I mentioned in an earlier comment, we see beginnings of some light there in the very critical vending channel. And I think that is much more critical to the revenue and to the NSR than the different product categories. Also CBS, I think we're beginning to see some really good positive developments in the CBS channel as well. But I think, vending, which is a really critical channel, is beginning to show some improved lights.\nJohn Faucher - JPMorgan Chase: Okay. And then one follow-up there, which is when you look at that impact, whether it's the channel piece or the mix from non-carbs and the CSDs, how much of the global mix decline do you think that is? Is that a small piece or is that a pretty sizeable piece, just for the Japan portion?\nMuhtar Kent: I would say on a global basis, it's not that sizable.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus.\nMark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus: Muhtar, on Mexico, could you give us some more color on the performance in the quarter, including that sequential improvement, and then share with us more on your outlook for Mexico?\nMuhtar Kent: Again, the portfolio is working very well in the company. I just want to reiterate, as I get into the Mexico details, because in our quarter where Mexico was down and a quarter where China grew mid-single digits, we achieved a strong, I may add, organic 3%-plus growth in our global volume. And I think that's a testimony to how well we're doing all across the world and our brands are doing all across the world. And our investment programs are paying off all across the world. So that's point number one. Number two, on Mexico, very, very seasonable weather, and I think essentially we have seen improved results, positive rates of growth in the latter part of the quarter. And I think that leads me to believe that we will put back to trends in Mexico.\nOperator: And next is Lauren Torres with HSBC.\nLauren Torres - HSBC: Good morning. Another market you mentioned did sequential improvement was Russia. So just curious, coming off a rather difficult year last year, what kind of changes are you seeing in that market this year, and I think maybe also Central and Eastern Europe, some similar comments may apply. So can you just give more color on what you think with respect to the recovery in those markets?\nMuhtar Kent: Lauren, I think, I see at it this way. Russia always goes deeper and comes back quicker and with more rigor. So therefore, that's what's we're going to see I believe in Russia. And you'll see a more market return of the Russian consumers back to their normal habit, I believe, in the coming year or so. And I think that the return to normalcy in Eastern Europe is going to take a little longer, although Eastern Europe didn't go down as far as Russia. So I think those are the comments. I think Russia, already after, as you said, a very difficult consumer environment in 2009 where we saw double digit declines for the whole PPG sector, is beginning to show again positive developments where we're almost even in the quarter in Russia, minus-1. And we importantly grew trademark Coca-Cola double digits in Russia, which as I said was pleasing for me. So as we go into the summer, and Russia again is a very seasonal-dependent market, I believe that we will see sequential improvement in both the sentiments of the consumer in Russia, the spending of the consumer in Russia and also our business.\nLauren Torres - HSBC: And can I also ask, in Europe, your volumes were even in the quarter and you highlighted a lot of markets that are improving, where is the particular weakness that just got you to flat volumes in Europe and not seeing an improvement in that region?\nGary Fayard: Well, I think I can't give you any more details, but I can tell you the following that certainly Southeast Europe was not as strong as some of those markets that we referenced. Spain continues to be challenged, for example.\nOperator: And next is Caroline Levy with CLSA.\nCaroline Levy - CLSA: Good morning. Just want to dig into, number one, market share in North America just to make sure. It seems that you did lose overall market share in North America, even though you gained in stills. And I'm just wondering why you think that might have happened?\nMuhtar Kent: Well, Caroline, first, I think as far as North America is concerned, in terms of our value share in the quarter in sparkling, we lost a little bit of value share in the full quarter as we looked into our volume share in North America. Again, we had slight losses in sparkling and also in still. And I think that is again a result of our discipline in pricing in the United States and what we saw is a bigger loss of share in the beginning of the quarter and some of that share gains were coming back in the latter part of the quarter to result in slightly down share in both volume and value, and in both still and sparkling.\nCaroline Levy - CLSA: And do you expect to reverse that, and are you saying it's a function of a widening price gap versus the competition?\nMuhtar Kent: As I said, it was the difference between the first half of the quarter and the second half. Volume share decline was mainly due to very aggressive competitive pricing in the beginning of the quarter, bundling and so forth, as well as pricing. But I think CCNA and CCE continue to focus on building consumer and customer value through strong brands, and we see tremendous value from being disciplined in our pricing between our future consumption and our immediate consumption channels. I think therefore that we anticipate also that the industry will return definitely to rational pricing through the balance of the year, and we've seen some of that also certainly in the latter half of the quarter.\nCaroline Levy - CLSA: And in China, your comps actually get much harder, your comparisons, as you move through the year. So, do you think this is perhaps the year where we should not expect double digit volume growth in China?\nMuhtar Kent: Well, first, Caroline, I think China still continues to remain the most important growth market for the company, and I think through the end of 2009 as you saw, we held double digits in China. It's been 26 consecutive quarters since 2003 till the end of 2009, and during that time, '03 to '09, our base grew threefold, almost to 1.8 billion cases or over 400 billion servings per annum. Having said that, we all know that China remains a complex, rapidly changing market. But I can reiterate one thing; our brands, our investment, our innovation platforms remain very healthy, and I would state that we would be disappointed if we would not continue to achieve double digit growth on an annual basis in China going forward. If you view our business in China over the past six months, our volume averaged at 16% growth over the last six months. Very consistent with same prior year period, and this is very similar to what you would have seen also if you compared quarter four of '08 versus quarter one of '09.\nCaroline Levy - CLSA: I have a question for Gary. Currency looks like it added $0.05, so it would have been $0.75 without the of currency benefit, is that right?\nGary Fayard: Yes, that's about right, Caroline.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research \nAlice Longley - Buckingham Research: My question is about price mix, and I think you've talked about it in the Pacific. Could you talk about Latin America and Eurasia-Africa? It was I think 10% in Latin America. Is that likely to persist through the year? And the negative 5% Eurasia-Africa, could you talk about that?\nGary Fayard: I'd say a couple of things; in Latin America, we got very strong price mix of ten points, and that's both in pricing mix and geographic mix. So everything was positive in Latin America. I don't know if that will continue at that kind of pace. I don't think anyone would expect you could continue that forever. But Latin America is doing extremely well across all the metrics, and particularly as we've seen Mexico coming back some, we would expect to see very positive results we have in Latin America through remainder of this year.  Eurasia and Africa, there was a negative 5 plus price mix there. It is primarily driven by geographic mix of higher growth in Northern Africa for example, lower sales in South Africa. But as I mentioned, the concentrate sales are behind cases in South Africa, which is what's driving that. I would expect that to reverse in the remainder of the year, and so a lot of that will start coming back.\nAlice Longley - Buckingham Research: So that price mix could actually turn positive ahead?\nGary Fayard : Yes, it could.\nAlice Longley - Buckingham Research: OK, good. Thank you.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Gary and Jackson. In closing, the actions taken this quarter as well as our management team's continued performance track record gives us confidence in our company today in our path to 2020. We will continue to generate strong cash flow, and redeploy that cash to both growing our business and rewarding our shareholders. We are investing alongside our system, and leveraging our global franchise network to win consistently and sustainably around the world. At the same time, we're committed to delivering consistent value to our share owners through regular dividend payments and share repurchase programs. We will execute flawlessly on our 2020 vision by working closely with our global bottling partners, our employees, our customers, and all our key stakeholders.  As I said, we see tremendous opportunity ahead for the Coca-Cola Company in all our markets, and remain intently focused on partnering across our system to execute our strategic priorities and generate long term sustainable growth. And most of all, we thank you for your interest in investment in our company.    There is no greater responsibility than earning your trust and confidence. So rest assured, we're working tirelessly to keep our commitments and grow the value of your investment in our company. Thank you for joining us this morning.\nOperator: And that concludes today's call.

Please look on our website for this information. Now I will turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm pleased to share The Coca-Cola Company continues to operate from a position of real strength. Our brands continue to get stronger. Our strategies continue to be sound, and our execution continues to be focused and effective. All of this continues to drive sustainable growth and continues to bring us closer to achieving our 2020 Vision. One day, one week, one month and one quarter at a time. Thanks to the extraordinary determination and resolve of our 146,000 company associates around the world, we delivered volume and revenue growth this quarter in every one of our 5 geographic operating groups. And we achieved financial results for both the quarter and the full year in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets, making this the seventh consecutive quarter we have either met or exceeded our long-term growth targets. Our global sparkling beverage portfolio kept growing, up 2% for the quarter and a solid 4% for the full year. Our global still beverage portfolio is also performing well, up 6% for the quarter and a strong 8% for the full year. And we gained global volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, while also gaining global share in both sparkling and still beverage categories. We achieved these results for both the quarter and the full year against the backdrop of a volatile global economic landscape. Even as we believe that the unease in the global markets will continue in the near term, the breadth of our global footprint and the strength of our brands create a business that was built for times like these, resilient and resolute to grow. Our solid performance in 2011 reflects the consistent investments we have made over time to strengthen the health of our brands, starting with brand Coca-Cola, the very oxygen of our business, up 3% in both the quarter and the full year. In fact, brand Coca-Cola grew by at least 24 million servings in 24 different countries this past quarter. Our brand health and brand value have been created over the long-term through strong and consistent investments in our business, rather than through short-term incremental actions. And this is why we remain so committed to our long-term brand investment strategies. Our 2011 performance results underscore how our company, together with our global bottling partners, is well aligned and positioned to lead in this difficult environment. As we enter into the third year of our 2020 Vision, our roadmap for winning together remains clear to us and our committed bottling partners. The assumptions that shaped our vision have not changed. Our expectations for strong performance have not wavered. The key to our calculus for growth and achieving our 2020 Vision will be to ensure that we keep creating balanced growth across both emerging and developed markets, as well as sparkling and still categories. We successfully achieved this balance in 2011. For the full year, we delivered almost 1 billion unit cases of incremental organic volume growth, or the equivalent of adding another Japan to our business. And importantly, we delivered positive full year growth in key developed markets like North America, Japan and Germany, while also generating double-digit full year growth in key emerging markets like India and China. And we will continue to make significant investments in our future, all across the world. In fact, in order to achieve our 2020 Vision, we anticipate our global system will add about 100,000 jobs in this decade as we invest to support the tremendous opportunity we see in nonalcoholic beverages, one of the fastest-growing industries in consumer packaged goods. So let's review our fourth quarter and full year results. Worldwide, we grew volume 3% this quarter, in line with our long-term growth target. For the full year, we grew worldwide volume by 5%, including the benefit of cross-licensed brands, primarily Dr. Pepper in North America. Excluding these brands, we delivered strong full year volume growth of 4%, also in line with our long-term target. As for our profit results, we grew comparable earnings per share by 10% for both the quarter and the full year, ahead of our long-term target. As we close the second year of our 2020 Vision, this also marks the second consecutive year we've delivered double-digit comparable earnings per share growth.  Now let's briefly review performance results across our operating groups, beginning first with North America where our team remains focused on driving profitable and sustainable growth. North America volume was up 1% in the quarter, making this North America's seventh consecutive quarter of growth. And for the full year, North America's organic volume growth was also up 1%. The North America business gained total market volume and value share in sparkling, still and nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in both the quarter and the full year. And we delivered these strong results while in the process of successfully integrating the largest acquisition in our company's history. Our sparkling beverage results in North America were even for the quarter, with brand Coca-Cola volume up 1%. We achieved these results while also earning an increase in retail pricing of 4% in sparkling beverages through the effective execution of our occasion-based brand, package, price and channel strategies. As for Coke Zero, it was up high-single digits in North America this past quarter and up double digits for the full year, making this the fifth consecutive year of double-digit growth. We also drove positive growth for Fanta, which was up 3% in 2011, its second consecutive year of positive growth. Our still beverages in North America delivered 3% growth in the quarter and 4% growth for the full year while gaining share for the seventh consecutive quarter. POWERADE continues to be a leading driver of this solid growth, up 11% in the quarter and 12% for the full year. And POWERADE once again captured both volume and value share in the sports drinks category, both for the quarter and for the full year. Our key brands delivered double-digit growth in the quarter led by Gold Peak, which grew double digits for the 19th consecutive quarter. As we've always said, there's no other western developed market in the world that boasts as dynamic the demographics as those present in North America between now and 2020. Young, vibrant, diverse, educated and entrepreneurial. We like these attributes and have every reason to remain excited about the long-term outlook of our flagship market. Turning now to our Pacific Group where in 2011, our business again delivered consistent growth across a diverse set of markets. Overall, our Pacific Group volume was up 5% in both the quarter and the full year, and these results were led by China, up double digits in the quarter and for the full year, making this 9 out of the last 10 years that our business in China has delivered double-digit growth. Our efforts to enhance the consumer experience with our sparkling beverage brands keep paying dividends, with sparkling beverages up double digits in China for both the quarter and the full year. Importantly, we're seeing strong growth across our entire sparkling portfolio, with Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta all delivering double-digit growth in both the fourth quarter as well as in the full year 2011. At the same time, our still beverage portfolio brands are sustaining their solid momentum, also delivering double-digit growth for the full year. These results confirm that we are executing the right strategies and have the right capabilities in place in China to deliver sustainable double-digit growth over the long-term. Japan's fourth quarter results were up 5%, resulting in slightly positive full year growth, rounding to even. This is a better-than-anticipated full year result in light of the tragic national disasters that occurred last March. This also underscores the strength and resilience of our people and brands across the entire Japanese bottling system. Notably, we realized greater momentum across several key channels in Japan this quarter, including convenience stores and vending as we further increase our focus on single-serve beverages. Moving now to Latin America where in 2011 we once again expanded our volume and value share leadership position. Volume in this total region was up 4% in the quarter and 6% for the full year. This strong performance was once again led by Mexico, up 4% for the quarter and 9% for the full year. Our business in Mexico gained volume and value share in both sparkling and still beverages for both the quarter and the full year. In fact, our still beverage portfolio in Mexico reached nearly 1 billion unit cases in 2011, a short 4 years after the successful integration of Jugos Del Valle into our winning portfolio. The rapid evolution of our brands in Mexico is a great testament to our team's ability to execute clear, occasion-based channel strategies across all beverage categories in this key market. We're also advancing our momentum in Argentina, which delivered double-digit full year growth while capturing volume and value share in both sparkling and still beverages for the 12th consecutive quarter. And finally, Brazil, volume was up 1% for the full year. Despite a general slowdown in the economy and unfavorable weather, our business in Brazil keeps outperforming the industry, gaining share across both sparkling and still beverages in both for the quarter as well as the full year. Let's now turn to the Eurasia and Africa Group. In 2011, we made sound progress against our goal to strategically invest for tomorrow while gaining share today. Volume in this region grew 4% in the quarter and a solid 6% for the full year. Importantly, our growth in Eurasia and Africa was driven by the continued strong momentum of brand Coca-Cola, up 5% in the quarter and 7% for the full year 2011. Our overall performance in this key region was once again led by India, which delivered 20% growth for the quarter, resulting in double-digit growth for the full year. 2011 was the fifth consecutive year that India achieved double-digit growth. And that\u2019s been the case throughout 2011, growth in India was well balanced across our entire portfolio. Sparkling beverages in India were up over 20% this quarter while brand Coca-Cola was up a strong 15%. And still beverages in India were up 16% this quarter, benefiting from a healthy growth across our juice portfolio, including Maaza, up 19%. Russia was down low-single digits in the quarter, fourth quarter, cycling last year's very strong 31% growth. On a full year basis, our business in Russia was up mid-single digits. Our business in Russia is being led by the strong growth of brand Coca-Cola, which delivered double-digit growth in 2011. Brand Coca-Cola is now more than twice the size of our primary competitor's cola brand in Russia. Notably, our overall business in Russia keeps outperforming the rest of the industry, gaining both sparkling and still beverage volume and value share. Turning to Turkey. We gained volume and value share this quarter in both sparkling and still beverages. For 2011, Turkey again delivered double-digit growth as it did the previous year in 2010. And despite geopolitical challenges in the region, our Middle East and North Africa business unit delivered a solid 7% in the quarter and 8% for the full year. A clear example of our commitment to invest in tomorrow in this exciting Middle East region is our recently announced agreement to acquire approximately half of the equity of Aujan Industries. Aujan holds the #1 position in the still beverage business across the entire Middle East. Their brands hold a top 3 position in every market where they compete. This strong partnership with Aujan, coupled with the strength of our bottling partners, will make the Coca-Cola system a leader in the fast-growing still beverage category in the Middle East. Let's now turn to Europe, a region of the world that is still facing a very uncertain economic environment. Yet, for The Coca-Cola Company, it is also a region that serves as a testament to how well our system is positioned to face these serious economic challenges. Our business in Europe grew 1% in the quarter, making this Europe's sixth consecutive quarter of volume growth, resulting in a full year growth rate of 2%. We achieved these results by strategically tailoring our price and package offerings to meet the needs of each market and their varying economic conditions. Our growth in Europe was widespread, with positive fourth quarter and full year growth across several key markets in Northwest Europe and Spain. And we saw the continued growth of Innocent, supported by the successful launch of not-from-concentrate juice in Great Britain. Our growth in Europe was once again led by Germany, up a very strong 9% for the quarter and up 6% for the full year, representing our best full year growth result in Germany since 1992. While some of this growth should be attributed to favorable weather and consumer sentiment, there's no doubt that our bottling restructuring efforts as well as effective marketing campaigns have played a key role in this improvement. We're confident that our business in Germany is in a sound position to continue delivering long-term sustainable growth. Looking ahead to 2012 and 2013. Despite the lingering debt crisis coupled with economic and political uncertainty, we are confident that we have the right brands, the right structure, the right strategies and right capabilities in place to continue delivering profitable growth in Europe over the longer term. Now let's turn to an overview of how we are building our brands. As we've said before, we always place our brands first in all that we do, across more than 200 countries all around the world. This is how we've built the world's most valuable beverage brand portfolio, with 15 $1 billion brands, more than any other beverage company. Our top 4 brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta and Diet Coke, all once again exceeded $10 billion in global retail sales in 2011. A key component of how we strengthen our global brand portfolio is through innovative consumer engagement. We continuously strive to engage with our consumers in an integrated manner across all social media platforms. A recent example of our efforts in this front was this past weekend's very successful Super Bowl campaign where we engaged fans like never before. Through a unique online viewing experience, fans got to chat with our animated polar bears and see their game reactions. And they watched the bears move from the digital realm of the TV as they starred in 3 new well-received and highly rated TV commercials. And an estimated 300,000-plus fans joined the polar bears live, far exceeding expectations. And by the second quarter, the Coca-Cola Facebook feed was receiving 3,400 hits per second. This is just one of the -- a string of marketing achievements for our company. Recently, we were humbled by the Advertising Age naming The Coca-Cola Company as its 2011 Marketer of the Year. And it's gratifying to see our global marketing efforts recognized by this industry-leading publication as we strive to develop and deploy the world's most innovative and effective marketing. Let me update you now on our progress around winning at the point of sale. Our system continues to develop critical capabilities to better support over 20 million customers we partner with each and every week to deliver these servings. We measure our progress against this effort by tracking our results across several high-impact, pragmatic and locally actionable metrics. One metric we have referenced several times this past year is our immediate consumption volume growth. And this metric is meaningful as it drives trial, drives recruitment and system profitability. In 2011, our immediate consumption beverages were up 4% globally, driven by focused in-store activation efforts and cold drink equipment expansion. In fact, as a global system, we've placed over 1.2 million new pieces of cold drink equipment in 2011 and have placed over 2.2 million since 2010, the first year of our 2020 Vision. Another key metric we monitor closely is the expansion of our right execution daily, or RED program in short. Some of you may remember RED as our world-class commercial process designed to improve execution at the outlet level. Today, operations representing over 1/3 of our global volume utilize RED. And for comparison, when we initiated our 2020 Vision just 3 years ago, less than 15% of our global volume was distributed through operations using RED. So as we move into 2012, our RED program will remain an area of increasing emphasis, focus and growth for our system. Before concluding our operating results review, I'd like to update you on our productivity goals. A leading priority of our company is to design and implement an effective and efficient business system, with productivity as one of our core pillars of our 2020 Vision. As such, in 2012, we're implementing a new 4-year productivity and reinvestment program that we will -- we expect will achieve between $550 million and $650 million of total incremental annualized savings by the end of 2015. I'm pleased and excited to announce this program from a position of continued growth and momentum towards realizing our 2020 Vision as we consistently deliver results in line with or ahead of our long-term targets. This program will further enable our efforts to strengthen our brands and reinvest our resources to drive long-term profitable growth. We remain relentless in our efforts to become more efficient, leaner and adaptive to changing market conditions, while at the same time building a continuous improvement in cost management culture in keeping with our 2020 Vision. Gary is going to share further details about this new 4-year program in a few moments. Finally, I also want to highlight some of the important progress we're making in the area of sustainable packaging, water stewardship and climate protection. By the end of 2011, we've shipped nearly 10 billion PlantBottle packages, helping reduce our annual emissions of carbon dioxide, while also decreasing our dependency on oil-based resin. As noted in our latest Sustainability Report, we improved our water use efficiency for the eighth consecutive year, reducing the average amount of water required to produce each beverage serving. We estimate that we replenished 35% of the water used in our finished products due to some 380-plus community water partnerships in 94 countries as we work toward our goal of water neutrality by 2020. And we increased our production volume while reducing our system-wide global carbon emissions by 2%, putting us a step closer to our goal of growing our business but not our carbon. These are just a few examples of how we're building our business responsibly by making a positive difference in the communities that we serve -- we proudly serve. These efforts are helping us engage with consumers, reduce our cost of doing business and improve our bottom line. We are keenly aware of how uncertain the global economic landscape remains today. That said, as we look ahead, we see a world looking for hope, for optimism and for renewal. The Coca-Cola Company and the Coca-Cola system is uniquely positioned to refresh this thirsty world. We're refreshing the thirst of our investors consistently by delivering high-quality returns to shareowners, while also generating steady cash flows and paying a steady healthy dividend. We're refreshing the needs of thirsty global consumers through our diverse brand portfolio and the world's most innovative and effective marketing. We're refreshing the needs of a thirsty system by increasing our levels of global investment along with our dedicated bottling partners. We're refreshing our operations through a culture of continuous improvement. And central to this is extending and driving productivity efforts to design and implement a more effective and efficient business system. And we are refreshing the needs of our communities through global and industry sustainability leadership. The nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry grew by $35 billion in total retail value in 2011. We're pleased to say that our Coca-Cola system represented more than 40% of this total industry growth, underscoring that our 2020 Vision is working well. And while 2011 was another strong year of performance for The Coca-Cola Company, we believe we are just getting started and that our best and brightest days lie ahead. We have a lot to be thankful for, and confident about healthy and beloved brand, a clear roadmap for continued growth, a well-aligned global bottling system, dedicated and passionate associates and strong financial results and discipline. Taking into account all of these assets to our business, we remain resolute in our desire and confident in our ability to achieve our long-term growth targets and further enhance the value of your investment in The Coca-Cola Company. With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary.\nGary P. Fayard: Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We once again delivered quality results this quarter and for the full year, in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets. In fact, our full year volume and profit results were in line with or exceeded our long-term growth targets for the sixth consecutive year. We continue to achieve these consistent high-quality results during a period of still mixed economic recovery, which is a real testament to our global system's ability to execute our strategic plans in alignment with our 2020 Vision. So let's review our earnings results in more detail. We reported comparable earnings per share of $0.79 this quarter, up 10% versus the prior year. Our full year comparable earnings per share growth also was up 10%, ahead of our long-term growth targets. For the quarter, comparable currency neutral operating income was up 14%, bringing our full year comparable currency neutral operating income growth to 12%, also ahead of our long-term growth target. For clarity, the impact of currency on our comparable operating income results was a 3% headwind for the quarter and a 3% benefit for the full year, right in line with the quarterly and full year outlook range we've provided during our last earnings call in October. Our business delivered comparable currency neutral net revenue growth of 6% this quarter, in line with our long-term growth target, including a 5% increase in concentrate sales and positive price mix. On a full year basis, our comparable currency neutral net revenue growth came in at 29%, including a 5% increase in concentrate sales, positive price mix and the impact of the CCE transaction. And again, for clarity, the impact of currency on our comparable net revenue results was a 1% headwind for the quarter and a 3% benefit for the full year. Our combined international and bottling investments group price product mix was a positive 3% for the quarter. And our North American price product mix came in at a positive 2% in the quarter, driven by a 4% increase in our pricing to retailers for our sparkling beverages in North America. Our consolidated geographic mix was down 1%, which resulted in a consolidated price mix at the midpoint of our long-term target range of 1% to 2%. For 2012, we anticipate our consolidated price mix results will remain in this target range of 1% to 2%. Turning to the rest of our P&L. We expected our consolidated comparable gross revenues to decrease slightly in 2011, which they did due to increased commodity cost, as well as the impact of our acquisition of CCE's North American bottling operations. Importantly, we expect our 2012 consolidated comparable gross margins will remain in line with 2011, even after taking into consideration further commodity cost inflation, which I'll discuss in a few minutes. Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were even in the quarter and up 30% for the full year. As explained in prior quarterly calls, this full year increase reflects the impact of acquiring CCE's former North American business, which we did not fully cycle until the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in SG&A also reflects our continued investments around the world. On this front, for the full year 2011, we grew our direct marketing expenses ahead of unit case growth, sustaining our commitment to invest in the health and the strength of our brands. As for operating expense leverage, it came in positive this quarter for both North America and the Bottling Investments Group. As expected, operating expense leverage for our international operations came in slightly negative in the fourth quarter due to the timing of expenses. And operating expense leverage for international came in at even for the full year as planned. For 2012, we expect to capture low-single digit operating expense leverage as we keep strategically investing in brand-building activities around the world and efficiently managing our operating expenses. Our net interest income came in at a positive $66 million, slightly above the full year forecast we provided in our last earnings call. For 2012, our best estimate is that net interest income will come in between $20 million and $40 million, primarily due to lower interest rates in some international locations. We expect this income to be spread relatively evenly across the quarters in 2012, and we'll update you each quarter as appropriate. Finally, we closed 2011 with an underlying effective tax rate of 23.9% and expect our 2012 underlying effective tax rate to fall between 24% and 25%.  Moving to our cash flow from operations. Year-to-date, this came in at $9.5 billion. As a reminder, this cash flow result includes $769 million contribution made to our pension plans in the first quarter of 2011. Net of these additional pension plan contributions, we grew our net cash flow from operations a positive 7% for the full year. With regards to our share repurchase program, our net share repurchases totaled $2.9 billion in 2011, at the high end of the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range communicated during our last earnings call. And in 2012, we again expect to repurchase a net share amount within the same $2.5 billion to $3 billion range. Now let me take a moment to update our outlook on several additional items that may help you model our business in 2012, starting with a quick reminder about this year's calendar. Even though 2012 is a leap year, our first quarter of 2012 will have one less day when compared to the first quarter of 2011. And the fourth quarter of 2012 will have 2 more days when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Now let me come back with our outlook on commodities. As we indicated in our last earnings call, our incremental commodity costs for 2011 came in at approximately $800 million. As a reminder, these costs were related to the raw material and conversion costs associated with sweeteners, metals, juices and PET plastic. As we look ahead to 2012, we anticipate the underlying commodities related to these inputs will remain somewhat pressured, driven primarily by increases in the cost of juices and sweeteners. As a result, we expect the full year 2012 incremental impact of commodity costs on our results to range between $350 million and $450 million. Having said that, we believe we have the right strategic plans in place to mitigate the impact of these incremental commodity costs and remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term growth targets. Turning now to currency. These have continued to fluctuate with the dollar strengthening, although more moderately against many key currencies. We're mostly hedged for 2012 on the euro and yen, with good coverage on several other currencies. After considering these hedged positions, we currently expect currencies to have a low single-digit negative impact on operating income for the first quarter of this year and a mid-single digit negative impact for the full year. As per our normal practice, we'll update you both on our commodity and currency forecast on a quarterly basis as we go through the year. Now let me update you on our productivity goals. As we closed 2011, we've now successfully completed our 2008 to 2011 4-year global productivity program. We completed this program on plan and with actual annualized savings of over $500 million, exceeding our initial savings target of $400 million to $500 million. As Muhtar mentioned earlier, we're now launching a new 4-year productivity and reinvestment program. In light of this, I want to take a moment and walk you through the components of the new program. First, a new 4-year global productivity initiative starting this year. This initiative will target between $350 million and $400 million in annualized savings focused around 4 primary areas: one, global supply chain optimization; two, global marketing and innovation effectiveness; three, OpEx leverage and operational excellence; and four, data and IT systems standardization. We're in the initial stages of defining the one-time costs associated with capturing these savings, and we'll provide an update on these costs in our next earnings call. Second, as we move through 2011, we accelerated our CCR integration efforts to support brand-building initiatives, reinvest in marketing and sales capabilities, as well as to partially offset some of last year's increasing commodity costs. As a result, we effectively realized nearly all of the $350 million in annualized savings in 2011, almost 3 years ahead of schedule. This is a testament to the great work of our CCR team and their ability to effectively realize and capture synergies while simultaneously delivering profitable growth. Further, we have successfully identified incremental CCR integration synergies in North America, primarily in the area of our North American product supply, which will better enable us to service our customers and consumers. As such, we now believe our CCR integration efforts will capture an incremental $200 million to $250 million above our original $350 million target. And we expect to capture these incremental annualized synergies starting this year in 2012 and fully realize them by the end of 2015. Correspondingly, we're also increasing our estimate of total one-time cost associated with the capture of CCR synergies from $425 million to $800 million as we implement new initiatives to capture these higher synergies. Therefore, combining both our new global productivity initiative and our newly expanded CCR integration efforts represents a total incremental annualized savings of $550 million to $650 million. We expect to phase in the capture of these total incremental savings over 4 years, starting in 2012 through the end of 2015. Going forward, we'll report our progress in capturing these total incremental savings under one joint productivity and reinvestment program. As for how we intend to invest the savings generated by this new program, first, and in line with our 2020 Vision, these funds will enhance ongoing system-wide brand-building initiatives. And second, as these savings are realized, they may also help mitigate potential incremental near-term commodity costs. As we look back on 2011, we are greatly encouraged by our business achieving yet another solid year of quality results. There is no better proof that our 2020 Vision is working than our company's continued ability to consistently deliver results that meet or exceed our long-term growth targets even while facing volatile market conditions. And as you consider how to model our business going forward, I want to be very clear that our system remains fully committed to continuing our relative historic price premium for our brands in the marketplace. For as we have communicated several times in the past, we strongly believe and have consistently proven that the best way to drive long-term sustainable value is by earning price with our consumers in concert with a robust occasion-based brand package and channel strategy that drives profitable sustainable growth. That is why we remain confident we can keep delivering results in line with our long-term growth targets. Our system is healthy and financially strong. We continue to generate cash, invest in our brands, execute our 2020 Vision and growth strategies and pay a healthy dividend. Our seasoned management team, over 146,000 motivated company associates and highly capable global bottling partners are making the right actions and executing the right strategies to build on our strengths, to refresh a thirsty world and to drive our 2020 Vision. Before concluding our prepared remarks, I want to remind you that I'm looking forward to presenting at CAGNY in Boca Raton on Wednesday, February 22; as well as at the CAGE Conference in London on Wednesday, March 21. I hope to see many of you there at these great investor and analyst events. Operator, we're now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Muhtar, I guess 2 questions on the overall growth we saw in the quarter. We had been seeing 5s and 4s in terms of unit volume growth. We saw plus 3% in the quarter. I know comparisons were a factor, but can we zero in on the emerging markets trends you're seeing? And you highlighted the emerging markets, markets were per caps or below 150. You highlighted that was a plus 4% in the quarter. It was a plus 6% for the year. So is it possible to generalize on what's going on in those less developed markets and some of the plans you have to improve on that plus 4%?\nMuhtar Kent: You mentioned 2 questions. The one is on emerging markets. Is there another one?\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Yes, and the second is -- I guess the 2 parts are, a, what's driving that slowdown from kind of a plus 6% to a plus 4%? And then b, as you think about trying to see that 4% become a better number in coming quarters, what are some of the things you think that are going to help you do that?\nMuhtar Kent: Yes. I mean, I think, first, I don't think you can draw any trend. And we're pleased with our volume growth of 3%, which is in line with our long-term growth targets. And I think it's important to note the following: We're cycling an organic volume growth of 5% in the prior year, and full year volume is 4%, at organically high end of our long-term growth target for the year. And I'm really particularly pleased that all operating groups grew in the quarter. So a cornerstone of our vision is balanced growth across all geographies and balanced growth across our portfolio. We achieved that both for the quarter and for the year. And I don't think you can draw any conclusions. And also, we achieved this kind of growth in the year with not only just a very volatile economic environment, volatile commodity environment, but also one-offs like the issue in the Japan, the flooding in Thailand, rightsizing in a huge market like China where now our transactions are significantly ahead of our volume, which is a testament to the health of the business. And so yes, we've had some -- there has been some dislocations in some Middle East markets because of the volatility there, because of what's happened like Egypt and like other parts in North Africa. We believe that we see that improving. There's been -- South East Europe has been under tremendous pressure. Again, those markets are under 150 per capita because of all the volatility that's going on in Europe and around Greece. But I think we shouldn't draw any conclusions. As we look into 2012, we see healthy trends continuing in Latin America, healthy trends continuing in Eurasia and Africa -- African continent and also Middle East and Eurasia. We see healthy trends in most of the Pacific Rim and area, and we see healthy trends right here in North America. Right now, we see better trends in terms of the consumer mobility, eating out more and just less confusion of the consumer here in North America than we did 12 months ago. And we see that manifesting itself in our Foodservice business. And Europe, finally, I think, is going to be more volatile. And I think we will probably see first half of the year being more challenged in Europe than the second half of the year. That's sort of the way I would sum it. But I do -- in Europe, we have some great markets continuing to grow like Germany, like Scandinavia, like Northwest Europe. And then we still have challenging markets in the Southern Rim. Although again we had moderate growth in Spain also in the fourth quarter. So I believe that we will achieve our long-term growth targets over time in terms of volume, as well as also in terms of our ability to generate price mix across the world.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: That's great. And if I could follow up, zeroing in on some of those externals that you're describing, those dislocations you mentioned in regions like the Middle East and some of the other more recently more challenging markets, when you think about what's going on in some of those markets from a broader consumer standpoint and kind of what the Coca-Cola Company can do about those things, how are your packaging initiatives changing? And how are you thinking about spending money at the pull level in terms of how you're proposing folks take an added interest in your products in those markets?\nMuhtar Kent: Number one, Mark, our brands are getting stronger. We're continuing to invest, and you will see us continue to invest. And what happens in a quarter is not the result of our investment in that quarter or the previous quarter, but what are our investments 3 or 4, 5, 6 quarters ago. And we will continue to invest. Our brands continue to gain share. And if you look at our share results overall, right now, in the world, both in sparkling and in still beverages, they're all-time high. Brand metrics for sparkling as well as still beverages are trending in a very healthy manner. So brand health investments, stronger system, better alignment, all basically works in our favor even in times of volatility. And we're seeing that manifest itself.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Pecoriello with Consumer Edge Research.\nWilliam Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: Question. Looking out to 2012, we're likely going to see significant stepped up competitive spending in North America, maybe in some other markets. Gary, you talked about sustaining a price premium in the market. Muhtar, you talked about the long-term brand-building strategy. So how are you thinking about balancing profit growth goals, against sacrificing any market share in the event that the stepped up spending is greater than you expected in any one market any one given year? To what extent do you use portfolio management, et cetera?\nMuhtar Kent: Look, you are mostly, Bill, talking about North America here, right?\nWilliam Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: Yes. I mean, there could be stepped up spending in select international markets, but it probably would be mostly in North America. It's yet to be seen.\nMuhtar Kent: Yes. So let me address North America first. We've achieved a pretty healthy price mix in the fourth quarter, 2% including a rate increase in retail pricing of sparkling beverages at 4% in North America. And our brand strength continues, with brand Coca-Cola up 1% in the same quarter. And I believe -- I think it would be right to assume that this kind of rational pricing would continue in terms of rate for 2012. And that's what I would say because I think there is never room in business for irrationality over the long term. And that's how I would project. And I think we have -- we're going into this from a point of strength. Our brands are stronger. Our system is much stronger. Our metrics for customer service are much, much better, and I see us continuing with our momentum. And I think pricing actions should continue into 2012 in terms of rationality. And we anticipate taking additional pricing on key segments of the business through this year in accordance with our normal commercial practices. And we manage a very broad portfolio of our business. That's how I would reference it. In terms of international, I think you heard Gary talk about a 3% price mix in international, and I believe that, that's a testament again to the strength of our international business, which continues to be able to generate good price mix on top of good volume and still growing our market share. Those are the key metrics for international.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo.\nBonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I just wanted to drill down a little bit more on -- hoping you can provide a little bit more color on the price mix globally, that you reported up 1% in the quarter considering your geography mix was negative. So I guess I'd like to hear what some of the dynamics are that drove a negative geography mix? And then also, I'd be curious to hear how your price mix was impacted by your increased effort behind your smaller packages in a few of your key markets like North America and China.\nGary P. Fayard: Sure. Bonnie, why don't I take that one, initially anyway. If you look, where we actually came out was -- on consolidated price mix, it was right at 1.5% positive. So if you take that 3% for international including BIG, 2% for North America and then put like a negative 1% on geographic, you get right at -- it's 1.5% is where it comes out. And I would characterize it this way: that is a very good thing for the long-term. And that may sound unusual for me to say. But what it means is that we are continuing to invest and grow all of the emerging markets around the world. Most of those do have margins below the U.S. or Europe, for example, the more developed markets. But we're not milking the business. We're continuing to grow the business. At the same time, get very healthy margins in the business, and you can see those coming through the bottom line. So we continue to strengthen the whole business globally. As long as we're doing the right thing, I think you're going to see a negative geographic mix for a very long time, because what you want to see is healthy growth in emerging markets. You want to see very good growth in India. You want to see very good growth in China, et cetera. And at the same time, as Muhtar said, and critically important, then growth actually across every geographic region in which we operate. But when you put all that together, you will get negative geographic growth, and I think that's a great thing. But in total, as long as it's coming out in our 1% to 2% range, in the quarter it came out right in the middle of that, we're exactly where we want to be.\nMuhtar Kent: Yes, Bonnie, just to complement what Gary said, I think the key takeaways from how we think about our business and the health of our business overall is that as long as we can continue to achieve our volume targets, which we believe we can, and coupled with the kind of price mix, positive price mix that Gary talked about that we achieved for the year and for the quarter, I think -- coupled again with the investments that we are making, have been making and are continuing to make in the business, add on to that the productivity and reinvestment program, add on to that the increased weight of our total marketing, because imagine, every year in the last 3, 4 years, we've been adding more -- around 1 billion cases to our total business, that brings with it more marketing, more distribution, more production, all of that, and then the positive share gains, then we feel very confident that we can continue to deliver our long-term targets, despite all the volatility in the world.\nGary P. Fayard: And Bonnie, let me just come back to the last part of your question. I forgot to -- on rightsizing in -- I'll characterize it this way. In China, what we're able to do is actually take the entry-level pack from a 600 ml down to a 500 ml size bottle at the same price. So we actually gave the consumer something they actually preferred at the same price, which implicitly carries a price increase inside of that. So from there, we actually generated margin. For the U.S., what we're very focused on is ensuring we\u2019re giving the consumer -- this is back to that occasion-based, right package, right channel, right time, right place, giving the consumer what they want. This is the way you drive profitable, sustainable growth and deliver margins rather than just taking a couple of sizes, stacking it high and selling it cheap.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I just wanted to touch on the balance comments that you made earlier. And I guess, if you look at 2011, one of the real encouraging things is that the share of incremental profit in 2011 versus 2010 was pretty broad-based. So most regions contributed to incremental profit in 2011. If you look out to 2012, is that broadly, looking at the world this year, that you'll see more incremental profit growth from more regions, and I guess that helps offset some of the volatility in Europe? And then also, just connected to that, gross profit, I guess a little surprised that you're expecting gross margins to be flat, given the moderation in input cost. So if you could talk a little bit about that as well.\nMuhtar Kent: This is Muhtar. Let me just start answering your question and then Gary can come in also. But I think in terms of the overall businesses concerned, we believe that we can definitely continue to achieve a balanced portfolio and balanced geographic growth. And I think it is really critical for us to be able to do that, as we've done in '09, '10 and '11. And we have reason to believe that we can grow across Western markets, and we can grow across, certainly across at a higher rate, across our emerging markets, and that you'll see that continuing. And as we continue to gain scale in the emerging markets, you will continue to see our margins improving in those markets as they have been doing in the last 3, 4 years. So I will just say that yes, definitely balanced across geographies, North America, Japan, Europe. And then certainly, again, broad-based in the portfolio, both in sparkling and in still beverages. And still beverages growth that I mentioned in Latin America, for example, and the fact that it's an almost -- it's got to 1 billion cases in Mexico after 4 short years after Jugos Del Valle got integrated successfully into our business and now it's in many, many markets, flourishing in many markets across Latin America, is just another testament of still how much growth Latin America has still to offer. And the good news is that again, the growth -- as we build on growth on Jugos Del Valle, it hasn't stopped in any way the growth of sparkling beverages that continue to flourish and continue to prosper in Latin America.\nGary P. Fayard: So Bryan, it's Gary. Let me just add to that a couple of things. When you're talking about -- first on balanced growth, the other thing I'd say is as you think about obviously the most volatile region or economically challenged region this year will be Europe -- but also remember that this is a year where there are 2 events taking place in Europe, the Olympics and the Euro Cup are both this year and we happen to be the sponsor of both of those. And so I think it's one of those things that's going to help us in that market as well. Relative to gross margins, I'd say what you should expect to see is you should have seen increasing margins. But what's happening is with that $350 million to $450 million of commodity pressure, what we're doing is we believe we can offset that and hold our margins with the pricing actions that we're taking in the market, as well as the productivity efforts that we're taking as well. So it's really those commodity pressures that, again, granted are half of what they were in '11, but still substantial in 2012.\nBryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And Gary, I guess in terms of the gross margin, the geographic mix I guess would also be a slight drag on that as well. Is that right?\nGary P. Fayard: It actually is. Yes, it is.\nMuhtar Kent: And Bryan, just to close it, don't underestimate the fact that what I mentioned about immediate consumption growth. That is a critical element that has higher margins, higher prices, and it improves the mix of our business. And that is continuing at a very healthy rate, particularly also in Western markets like North America, as well as Europe. And that is again a key testament to the strength of our system, which requires very disciplined execution in the marketplace on a day-to-day basis. And I was recently in Western Europe in the marketplace with John Brock, our partner in CCE, and we saw great examples of how both the activation has already started around the Olympics, but also great execution in the marketplace from an immediate consumption perspective, as well as the brand, price, pack, occasion, channel architecture really working in our favor.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.\nJudy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Gary, a bit of a follow-up to Bryan's question, but really drilling into North America profit number. In fourth quarter, first clean quarter in lapping CCE acquisition, your profit was up 25%. I think the benefit that you called out in Q1, the timing shift on marketing, was about 7 points. So even excluding that, it looks like the profit was up pretty nicely in fourth quarter. So maybe a little bit of color as to what drove that profit improvement in Q4. And then as you think about 2012, you've got moderating inflation, you've got pricing that went into the marketplace, you've got cost synergies and cost savings coming through, why wouldn't we expect to see a pretty healthy profit growth in North America in 2012?\nGary P. Fayard: Okay. Thanks, Judy, very insightful question. Now let me see if I can give an insightful answer. Here's what I'd tell you. Relative to the fourth quarter performance on North America, you do see very healthy increase. A lot of that is actually what we're cycling. Because a lot of the marketing in the fourth quarter in legacy CCE, when we acquired it, there was a lot of marketing that was spent in the fourth quarter of 2010 that CCE had already planned and then we executed against in that fourth quarter. This year actually got spread through the year. So it was a timing of marketing, and so there are a few of those type anomalies. If you remember, if you go back I think I said in the third quarter call, that the fourth quarter of this year will be the first quarter that's actually comparable, but there are still some unusual things in the fourth quarter of 2010 that you need to go back and make sure you look at. So I just -- I'd say, everyone on the call, if you're interested in that, go back and look at some of those things. And what you'll see, it'll actually bring that profit increase down. It's still a nice increase and profitable, but it'll bring it down some in the fourth quarter of 2011. Relative to 2012, let me just say I hear you, and we are very enthusiastic about our business in North America. It is operating well. They were able to do one of the largest vertical integrations in the history of business and do it flawlessly, get basically 4 years of synergies in the first year, increased those synergies and at the same time continue to execute and take share in the market in a very profitable way. So I feel very good about North America, I'm bullish on North America. And we've got a very capable team over there executing every day.\nJudy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. Gary, just a follow-up on currency. The mid-single digit impact for the full year 2012 sounds like the hedged position is a bit of a drag. If you just take the spot rates, it sort of calculates to more like a low-single digit rate for the full year. So is that the correct assumption? And then to the extent that if there is an upside to currency, is it fair to assume that, that's going to come more from the emerging market currencies that you don't really hedge?\nGary P. Fayard: Yes, Judy. Actually, the hedge positions we have are in the money today. So on the euros particularly, we're in the money on that. So better than current spot. But where the drag is coming from and what you're not seeing is that it's really all those emerging market countries. And you'd be surprised at a lot of little countries that actually can start having, you add them all up and they can have a pretty large impact, which is moving you from -- I think you're probably seeing low-single digits, and I'm seeing mid-single digits full year, even though it's low-single digits first quarter. But if you look at Brazil, which is one of the big ones, it's been a pretty big move. Brazil strengthened significantly during last year then weakened significantly, and now it's coming back some. But it's a lot of these smaller emerging market currencies that are giving that impact. Now with that said, if you -- let me just tell you, give you some idea of the volatility. The swing of currencies on our earnings in 2012 in the last month is over $100 million in the last 30 days. And that's an improvement, by the way. Because we're seeing those kind of volatilities, we're seeing a lot of those emerging market currencies starting to come back, and they're coming back as the world is starting to accept a little risk where there was total risk aversion a month -- 6 weeks ago. So is there some upside? I hope so, but I don't know today. Because of the volatility, we just don't know. But I think as we move through the year, we'll continue -- but the volatility is going to continue as well.\nOperator: And our final question today comes from Caroline Levy from CLSA.\nCaroline S. Levy - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: A couple of things. In Japan, you had excellent volume growth and yet margins in the Pacific region were awful. And that to me was -- and when I say awful, they were down a lot year-over-year. That to me is surprising, especially given you had single-serve growth in Japan. So if you could address that, that would be really helpful. And then 2 other markets that looked surprisingly soft, Brazil went flat, which it really had been sort of bucking difficult economic trends. Did something change in Brazil? And then finally, it looks like Philippines were down fairly close to 20%. So if you could just address those 3 markets please?\nMuhtar Kent: Sure, Caroline. Let me start. I think Pacific volume grew a healthy 5% in both Q4 and the full quarter. And yes, Japan actually -- very positive in Japan, and it's a testament again to the strength of our system in Japan, to what we're doing in Japan, to the leadership of our business as well as our system in Japan. And I think that we ended up slightly positive despite all the dislocations in Japan. And that again basically bodes well going forward as to the strength of our business there. I think in terms of your question, how that relates to the Pacific, you need to look at I think the full year results of the Pacific. It was, from an income perspective, overall positive. And it's about the timing, and it's about marketing. Expenses also. How they're sort of distributed over the year. In terms of Brazil, I would say that Brazil -- I could just summarize by saying volume was up 1% for the full year. General slowdown of the economy and unfavorable weather did impact our business, but we are outperforming the industry, gaining share across all categories for the quarter and the full year. And I think you should expect sequential improvement in Brazil as we move through 2012. As far as Philippines is concerned, we've had essentially a difficult year as we continue to transform that business as it needs to be transformed into a healthy situation for the long term. And think about our German business, it took us a while to get it going again. We believe that certainly, the worst has passed us in the Philippines and that we should have -- in terms of also the tough macroeconomic environment post the elections has lingered on. But we believe that 2012 will be a better year in the Philippines than -- 2012 will be a better year than 2011. And I think Gary just wants to add something.\nGary P. Fayard: Yes, Caroline, it's Gary. I just want to correct one thing. On the Philippines, I think you said you were looking at it, you were thinking it was down 20% or so. Let me just -- Philippines in the fourth quarter and full year were down high-single digits. So high-single digits. It was not anything close to 20%.\nMuhtar Kent: Good. Thank you, Gary and Jackson. So in closing, our strong 2011 performance results and our consistent belief in the solid fundamentals of this great business provide us with the confidence we need to reaffirm our belief in our 2020 Vision. We're refreshing a thirsty world with a capable, resilient and advantaged system. We're laser-focused on delivering our 2020 Vision, and we remain committed to driving shareowner value through consistent, continuous investments for growth, dividend distributions and share repurchases. And I'd like to thank you for your continued trust and confidence in The Coca-Cola Company. And thank you for joining us this morning.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference.

Before we begin, I would like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report. In addition, I would also like to note that we have posted schedules on our company website at www.thecoca-colacompany.com, under the Reports and Financial Information tab in the Investors section, which reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to by our senior executives in our discussion this morning, and from time-to-time, in discussing our financial performance to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. Please look on our website for this information. Now I'll turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: Thanks, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of our 140,000 associates at The Coca-Cola Company, I'm pleased to share our earnings report for the third quarter. Once again, we delivered performance results in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets, making this the sixth consecutive quarter we have either met or exceeded our long-term growth targets.  We continue to advance our global momentum from a position of real strength, realizing growth across every one of our 5 geographic operating groups. For both the quarter and year-to-date, we once more gained global volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Our Global Sparkling Beverage portfolio keeps growing, up 4% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date. This growth was driven by brand Coca-Cola, which was up 3% in both the quarter and year-to-date. And earlier this month, Interbrand ranked Coke-Cola as the world's most valuable brand for the 12th consecutive year. Our Global Still Beverage portfolio is also performing well, up 9% for both the quarter and year-to-date. Importantly, we achieved these balanced quality results together with our system bottling partners during a time of ongoing global market volatility, which is a testament to our clear and focused vision, our strong brands and our solid execution.  Over the past few months, we've all seen a downturn in global consumer confidence. At the same time, the last few months have reinforced our belief in the resilience of the global consumer. In our business, we constantly track a number of key metrics. We look at total retail sales by country. We look at sales shifts across retail channels. We look at out of home dining and how many people are on the go. And what we've seen this past quarter is that across the world, nonalcoholic beverages continue to generate increasing demand. The key success factor in this current challenging environment is for businesses small, medium or large to be able to generate sustainable growth. And I'm happy that we're able to continue to crack this much-needed algorithm of growth. In Q3 of 2011, we generated almost 250 million unit cases of incremental growth, excluding cross-license and acquired brands, with nearly 50% of this growth coming from sparkling beverages. Just to give you a perspective, this 250 million unit cases of organic volume growth translates into over $1.7 billion of retail value growth, all in 90 days. For the first 9 months of this year, our organic volume growth was over 820 million unit cases, equivalent to creating another India and Russia combined. This achievement of growth is the combined result of precise and focused execution by our inspired system in each quarter combined with the targeted investments made by our system a year or in some cases 2 years prior to the quarter which is being reported. So while we all see volatility in the external environment and have every reason to believe that this volatility will remain through the near-term, the assumptions that guided the development of our 2020 Vision still ring true. As we complete the seventh quarter in our 2020 Vision, we see a world where population keeps growing at a very rapid rate, up 200 million since just 2008. At the same time, the world's largest cities are growing and have grown by almost 100 million people in the same period since 2008. And the global middle class is also growing. In fact since 2008, almost 200 million people have newly entered the middle class. We said it when we began our 2020 Vision journey and we say it again right now in 2011, our business was built for times like this. Our business is strong across channels and across consumer age groups. We're well positioned to connect with global consumers who have a greater disposition to shop across multiple retail channels in search of real value. So simply said, we provide consumers with an affordable luxury as they enjoy moments of pleasure for pennies at a time, billions of times every day. In February of this year during our presentation at CAGNY, the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference, we told you that when you have a consistent vision, a consistent belief in your brand, a consistent ethic of execution, the result is consistent quality performance. And while we may see an occasional bump along the road in a given quarter, every year since 2006 we've delivered volume and operating income growth in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets. We said this again at CAGNY back in February, that this trend remains true today. All of our attributes, a well-aligned bottling franchise system, healthy brands, strong financial performance and a clear 2020 Vision have put us in a position of real strength as we push ahead towards 2020. And that's why even during times of ongoing global market uncertainty, The Coca-Cola Company keeps delivering consistent top line and bottom line results. So let's review this quarter's results. We grew worldwide volume 5% this quarter and 6% year-to-date, including the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands, primarily Dr. Pepper brands in North America. Excluding these brands, we delivered strong volume growth of 4% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date ahead of our long-term growth target. As for our profit results, we grew comparable earnings per share by 12% this quarter, bringing our year-to-date comparable earnings per share growth to 10%, also above our long-term growth targets. Now let's briefly review performance results across our operating groups, beginning first with North America, our flagship market. Many of you on today's call have listened in or joined us last month in Houston for our investor event and market tour. You heard and saw firsthand how we are building our capabilities to drive our performance in North America. This quarter's results underscored the good progress we are making on this journey. North America reported volume up 5% for the quarter and year-to-date, making this North America's sixth consecutive quarter of growth. Our organic volume growth in North America was up 1% in both the quarter and year-to-date. In this past quarter, our North America business gained total market volume and value share in sparkling, still and nonalcoholic beverages, reaffirming our commitment to drive balanced growth across our portfolio. Our sparkling beverages in North America were down only slightly in the quarter with brand Coca-Cola volume even for the quarter, and we clearly outperformed the rest of the industry gaining both volume and value share in the sparkling beverage category. And we did so while earning 3% pricing in sparkling beverages this quarter through the effective execution of our occasion-based brand, package, price and channel strategies. We are driving profitable growth in North America through our 1.25-liter package which expanded nationally in August and is now available in over 80% of the U.S. supermarkets. In those markets where the 1.25-liter package was first launched in May of this year, we saw the combination of our 1.25-liter and 2-liter package transactions increase this quarter. We're also expanding the availability of our immediate consumption offerings with a new 12.5-ounce handheld PET packaged and a more affordable 7.5-ounce mini-can 8-pack.  As for Coke Zero, it was up 12% in North America this past quarter, making this its 22nd consecutive quarter of double-digits growth. Our still beverages in North America delivered mid-single digit growth and gained share for the sixth consecutive quarter. The leading driver of this growth was POWERADE, which delivered 9% growth in the quarter and is now up 12% on a year-to-date basis. POWERADE once again captured both volume and value share in the sports drink category this past quarter. And since July of 2010, POWERADE has added over 5 million new households, demonstrating how this innovative brand keeps resonating with sports drink consumers.  Our key brands delivered mid-single digit growth led by yet another quarter of double-digit growth for Gold Peak Tea. Finally, as many of you heard during our Houston event last month, our CCR Coca-Cola Refreshments integration is proceeding as planned. We remain confident that we have the right brands, right strategies and right capabilities in place for North America as we continue to be excited about the long-term outlook for our business in this key market.  Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, where we are delivering growth across a diverse set of markets. Overall our Pacific Group volume was up 5% in the quarter and up 6% year-to-date. This quarter's results were led by double-digit growth in China, up 11%. Sparkling beverages grew mid-single digits in China this past quarter led by brand Coca-Cola up 7%, supported by our strategy to introduce a wider variety of single-serve packages to our Sparkling Beverage portfolio. Last quarter we said this emphasis on single-serve packages would increase transactions and build brand equity. In fact, we observed 12% growth in sparkling beverage transactions in China this past quarter, well ahead of sparkling beverage volume growth. This is in line with our efforts to enhance the consumer experience with our brands, while better positioning our China sparkling business for long-term sustainable growth. At the same time, our Still Beverage portfolio in China keeps building momentum, up 24% this quarter and 19% year-to-date, led by Minute Maid Pulpy. We're confident that we are executing the right strategies and have the right capabilities in place in China to deliver sustainable double-digit growth over the long term. Japan's third quarter results were down 3%. We always expected seeing our volumes soften in Japan this quarter as we cycled 11% growth from last year's record hot summer conditions, while also working through the after-effects of the tragic national disaster in March. And that said, Japan's volume results this past quarter were better than we had originally thought, underscoring once again the strength as well as the resilience of our Japanese bottling system. We remain confident in the long-term health of our business in Japan. Moving now to Latin America. We continue to expand our volume and value share leadership across the region with volume up 7% for both the quarter and year-to-date. Latin America's broad-based growth was once again led by Mexico, up a strong 8% for the quarter and 10% on a year-to-date basis. Importantly, brand Coca-Cola keeps playing a significant role in driving growth for us in Mexico, up 6% for the quarter and 8% year-to-date. We gained both volume and value share in Mexico despite new pricing above the current rate of inflation. Our results in Mexico are a great testament to our team's capability to execute occasion-based brand package price and channel strategies that reinforce recruitment, as well as affordability with consumers in this key marketplace. We're also seeing further momentum in our Argentina business, which delivered double-digit quarterly and year-to-date growth while capturing volume and value share in both sparkling and still beverages for the 11th consecutive quarter there. Finally Brazil volume was up 1%, cycling 13% growth in last year's comparable period. Having said that, our growth in Brazil is ahead of the industry with our business in Brazil gaining share across both sparkling as well as still beverages. This reinforces our confidence that we have the right strategies in place in Brazil to build on our leadership position and keep expanding our share of industry growth in the years ahead. Brazil also offers a great example of how we partner with local communities during challenging economic times. We recently established a social business program in Brazil called Coletivo that aims to create shared value with communities through our core business activities. And in partnership with local NGOs, we teach entrepreneurship and retailing skills to young adults living in low-income areas supporting their entry into the formal job market. Coletivo prepares students through 2 months of training to deliver customized business opportunities to small outlets inside their communities. And we're providing a positive economic impact in these areas, while also helping us drive solid business results. And we are in the process of expanding this program across Brazil, for we strongly believe we have a role to play in helping consumers through tough economic times. And through this program we're creating unique value for our brands, our system, as well as local communities.  Turning now to Eurasia and Africa, we are strategically investing for tomorrow across a diverse array of markets while gaining both volume and value share today. Volume in this region grew 6% in the quarter and 7% year-to-date, led by strong results in India, Turkey, the Middle East and North Africa. India delivered 19% growth in the quarter, making this its 21st consecutive quarter of growth and bringing our year-to-date volume growth to double digits. This quality growth was well balanced across the entire portfolio. Sparkling beverages in India were up 19% this quarter, led by brand Coca-Cola's strong double-digit growth up 17%. And still beverages in India were up 17% again in the quarter, benefiting from healthy growth across our juice portfolio, including brand Maaza, up 19%. Turkey was up double digits in both the quarter and year-to-date, gaining volume and value share this quarter in both sparkling and still beverages. And Turkey is benefiting from our investments in cold drink equipment, which is increasing cold beverage availability for us in this key market.  Russia was down mid-single digits this past quarter, cycling very strong 30% growth from the same period last year. At the same time, our business in Russia outperformed the rest of the industry, gaining both sparkling and still beverage volume and value share in the process. And as you may have heard, we recently announced together with our bottling partners Coca-Cola Hellenic a new Russian investment program of $3 billion over the next 5 years starting in 2012, underscoring our commitment to invest in Russia for the long-term growth. Finally, our Middle East and North Africa business delivered 9% growth in the quarter, as we strengthened our position in this key region. Let me now move to Europe, a part of the world that faced an increasingly volatile economic environment, as well as unseasonably cold weather this past quarter. Despite the challenges, we gained volume and value share in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages and volume also grew slightly in the quarter rounding to even, making this Europe's fifth consecutive quarter of volume growth. And our year-to-date results in Europe are up 2%. Our growth in Europe continues to be led by Germany, up 4% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date. Our business in Germany gained volume and value share in sparkling and in the total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages segment. Our sparkling beverage growth in Germany was led by Coca-Cola, up 5% for the quarter as a result of our strategic focus on recruiting both lapsed consumers and a whole new generation of new consumers.  Before concluding our operating results review, I'd like to update you on our progress around winning at the point-of-sale by driving immediate consumption growth. Year-to-date, we are sustaining our strong momentum against this priority with immediate consumption beverages up 5% globally. Last quarter, we shared that each of our geographic operating groups was growing our Immediate Consumption Beverage business. Today, we can further confirm that 17 of our top 22 markets are also growing our Immediate Consumption Beverage business on a year-to-date basis. In fact, 9 of these markets are growing immediate consumption ahead of future consumption. This is quite an accomplishment in an economic environment which favors faster growth in at-home consumption. As the world's population and demographics keep growing and evolving, our system is focused on capturing more than our fair share of this highly profitable immediate consumption growth.  In closing, I'd like to say that we're advancing our momentum during a time of mixed economic recovery. Back in 2008 and 2009 when the world's financial markets were unraveling, our system committed to doing 3 things. First, we made a commitment to invest through the crisis. We did so by establishing a clear and focused 2020 Vision that called for investing in consumer marketing and sales and distribution with the mission of becoming the leader in every market in every category of value to us.  Second, we made a commitment to focus on the marketplace and to ensure that we have the right packages and price points for every occasion, including affordable entry packs for every consumer. And thirdly, we made a commitment to never let short-term considerations cloud our view of the long-term value of our business. As a result of these commitments, our system has never been stronger. We continue to solidify our leadership within the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry and during 2009 and '10, the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry grew by $35 billion in total retail value. We're pleased to say that our Coca-Cola system represented nearly 50% of total industry growth, well above our fair share. So in short, our 2020 Vision is working. Yet every one of us here at The Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola system know that we are really just getting started. All of us remain constructively discontent and resolutely focused on our exciting future; a future filled with abundant opportunities. Our job as stewards of this great business and as caretakers of your investment is to ensure that we keep advancing our system's momentum. With our 2020 Vision as our roadmap, we are confident that we can sustainably achieve our long-term growth target and enhance the value of your investment in The Coca-Cola Company.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Gary.\nGary P. Fayard: Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our performance this quarter. We once again delivered results in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets. And we continue to achieve these high-quality results during a time of mixed economic recovery, which is a real testament to our global system's ability to execute our strategic plans in alignment with our 2020 Vision.  So let's review our earnings results in more detail. We reported comparable earnings per share of $1.03 this quarter, up 12% versus prior year. That brings year-to-date comparable earnings per share growth to 10%, ahead of our long-term growth target. For the quarter, comparable operating income was up 21%, including a 6% benefit from currencies and higher commodity cost. This increases our year-to-date comparable operating income growth to 17%, including a 5% currency benefit offset by commodity headwinds.  Our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 45% this quarter, including a 5% increase in constant rate sales, a 5% currency benefit, positive price/mix and the impact of the CCE transaction. On a year-to-date basis, our comparable net revenue growth remains at 44%, including a 5% increase in concentrate sales, 5% benefit from currency, positive price/mix and the impact of the CCE transaction.  Our combined international and Bottling Investments Group's price mix for the quarter was a positive 2%. As for North America, we discussed in our last earnings call our plans to implement incremental pricing programs with many of our customers this quarter. As a result, our pricing to retailers in North America was up 2% in the quarter. And as Muhtar mentioned, this quarter's results was driven by a 3% increase in our pricing to retailers for our North American sparkling beverages. As such, our 2011 North American pricing strategy remains on track to earn between 2% and 3% for the full year, leveraging both rate and mix levers to earn price at a premium to our industry. As we continue to grow in North America through the effective execution of our occasion-based brand package price and channel strategies, which we shared with many of you last month during our investor event and market tour in Houston. If you were not in Houston with us last month or were unable to view the live webcast of our event, we encourage you to visit our website where all videos and presentations from Houston detailing our North American roadmap for growth have been posted. Turning now to our P&L. Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were up 42% in the quarter and 46% year-to-date. As explained in previous quarterly calls, this increase reflects the impact of acquiring CCE's former North American business, which we will cycle in the fourth quarter of this year. It also reflects our continued investments around the world. Year-to-date direct marketing expenses are growing slightly ahead of unit cases as we continue to invest in the health and strength of our brands. As we communicated last quarter, we expect our full year operating expense leverage to be negative for North America and our Bottling Investments Group and even for the full year for our international operations as we continue to make strategic investments in key markets around the world.  Our year-to-date cash flow from operations came in at $6.8 billion. As a reminder, this cash flow result includes a $769 million contribution made to our pension plans in the first quarter of this year. Net of the additional pension plan contributions, our cash flow from operations are up 5% year-to-date. Now let me take a moment to update our 2011 outlook for commodities and currencies. First, we've effectively leveraged retail pricing increases and the acceleration of cost saving initiatives to help offset this year's rising commodity cost. Having said that, our incremental cost estimate for 2011 now stands at approximately $800 million, ahead of the $700 million we indicated in our previous calls. Second, since our last earnings call in July of this year, currencies have continued to fluctuate with the dollar strengthening against many key currencies. We have hedged positions in place for most key currencies for the remainder of this year. We now expect currencies to adversely impact our fourth quarter operating income by low- to mid-single digits, while still providing a low- to mid-single digit positive impact for the full year. As we planned for 2012, we are looking at our combined exposure across both currencies and commodities. We anticipate that both items will keep moving in opposite directions next year, much like they have this year. And while we expect this movement to help partially offset each other's impact over the course of 2012, the timing of their respective impact on our results will likely vary from quarter-to-quarter. As for our normal practice, we'll provide a broader outlook on their expected impact on our 2012 full year results during our next earnings call in February.  Now let me take a moment to update you on several other programs and line items. Our company-wide productivity initiatives launched at the start of 2008 remain on track to exceed the upper end of our original target of $400 million to $500 million in annualized savings by the end of this year. As for synergies related to our CCE transaction, we still expect to deliver between $140 million and $150 million of net call synergies in 2011. With regards to our share repurchase program, on a year-to-date basis, our net share repurchases stand at $2.2 billion. As such, we're now increasing our share repurchase program with a plan to purchase at least 2.5 billion to 3 billion in net shares this year. As for net interest income, our current forecast for the full year is at the high end of our previously communicated range of $30 million to $40 million. This implies a slight net interest expense in the fourth quarter of this year. And our underlying effective tax rate stands at 24%.  Finally, we want to remind you that this is the last quarter in which we're cycling the acquisition of CCE's former North American business. That said, there were several one-time items that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to this acquisition that will continue to impact the comparability of both our as-reported and ongoing recurring results next quarter. We refer you to our previous comments regarding those one-time items, specifically to our modeling call held last year on December 14. The transcript and webcast of that call can be found on our investor website and of course Jackson and our Investor Relations team will be happy to follow up with you separately if you have any further questions. In closing, we're greatly encouraged to see our business deliver yet another quarter of solid volume, revenue, profit and earnings results. In the face of today's volatile market conditions our system is healthy and financially strong. We continue to generate cash, invest in our brands, execute our flexible and nimble growth strategies and pay a healthy dividend. In fact, The Coca-Cola Company has a long history of distributing dividends, having paid them consecutively every year since 1920 and increasing dividends for 49 consecutive years. With our seasoned management team and our highly capable global bottling partners, we're confident that we'll keep taking the right actions and executing the right strategies to build on our strengths, advance our global momentum and drive our 2020 Vision. Operator, we're now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bill Pecoriello from Consumer Edge Research.\nWilliam Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: Muhtar, Coke's been delivering top-tier global CBT [ph] company performance this year, but can you give us your outlook? If you look at the balance of the year and heading into 2012, considering global macros are slowing in certain regions, how is Coke going to sustain this momentum and what kind of investment is required to keep this going against this slowing backdrop?\nMuhtar Kent: Well firstly, I don't think you can say that there's a market deterioration. I think the whole year has been one of mixed consumer sentiment across the world in general, Bill. But what I'd like to say is that still I believe that the challenging areas are going to be certainly the Western markets, primarily I believe the U.S. environment as well as the European environment -- Western European environment is still going to be challenging, as challenging as the past 9 months and into the full year, this year probably. And in that environment, we're delivering positive results because our strategies are working, because of our past investments and how we execute against our vision, strength of our brands. We're gaining market share and I think when you look at our broad-based investment programs that we have announced, multiyear investment programs that we have announced whether they're in the Pacific in places like Malaysia, Philippines, China, Vietnam or whether they're in Eurasia and Africa, like India and Pakistan and Africa and the recent Russian investment that I announced when I was there 2 weeks ago in operating a plant in Rostov in the southern part of Russia with our Hellenic bottling partners or whether investments, multi-year investments in Mexico, Brazil, these total over $25 billion and you have these investments that are working for us despite the challenging environment, despite the confused consumer and despite the fact that the general environment is certainly much worse than ideal. However, I think that there will still be areas of growth in the world that we are going to materially benefit from in Africa, where our system is very strong, in Asia and Middle East and Eurasia where our system is very strong and in Latin America. And we will continue to re-architect our brand-priced pack channel offering both here and the United States as well as across the world just like we did in China, just like we did across many other parts of the world to ensure that we can still crack that code for growth on a sustainable basis. And we believe that we can continue to deliver growth in line with our long-term strategies. And yes, there may be a bump along the way in a quarter sometimes. But over the longer period and over the medium and longer period we believe, despite the economic conditions in the world that are much less than ideal, we believe we can continue to crack that algorithm for growth as we move forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.\nKaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Can we talk a little bit more about Europe and I guess the slowdown this quarter particularly versus last quarter? And it looks like your comp was also quite a bit easier. So you mentioned weather, but could you give us more context on what was behind the trend there?\nMuhtar Kent: Well I think we have -- volume in the quarter was slightly positive as I said rounding to even despite very unseasonably cold and rainy summer selling season and also the moderating consumer confidence. But I think we realized nonalcoholic ready-to-drink volume and value share gains across the whole of Europe, France -- including France, Germany, Great Britain. We also grew sparkling volume and value share and maintained still volume share for the overall group -- the European group. And again reported net revenue for the quarter and I think that was a performance that we were pleased with, given the conditions in Europe. And over Central and Southern Europe, volume declined. And I think the Eastern Central European area was still challenging and South East Europe, particularly also in Italy and Greece. But I believe overall, the portfolio worked for us like it did in the previous quarters in this year, and I believe that's what's going to continue to work for us as we move into the fourth quarter and the final quarter of this year as well as into next year. Brands are stronger than ever before. We're gaining market share and we have many innovations that are working for us in both packaging as well as in the still beverage portfolio area. And our marketing is working for us and next year we've got European championships, which is a Coca-Cola property as you know and we're going to leverage that in a very significant manner. And of course the Olympics and those 2 properties are going to be very strong for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.\nJudy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Gary, just on commodities, the $100 million step up this year. Can you talk about what's driving that? And then just any color as it relates to 2012 outlook? Is it going to be worse than what you see this year? How much are you hedged at this point?\nGary P. Fayard: Yes, Judy. Relative to the $100 million increase, it's really kind of across the board. A lot of PET, corn versus where we've been buying corn and although -- this is kind of, how do I answer this -- because we had some hedge positions and we're buying some more now at higher prices even though prices have come off a little bit. So the $100 million, by the way, was not a big surprise to us. Over the last couple of months, we saw it coming. And relative to 2012, really we'll go through all of that in February on the year-end call, on everything around 2012. Because I think one of the important things is to put everything in perspective. Number one was the volatility, I'm not sure I can give you a prediction on 2012 and it really mean anything. But the other, and I said a little bit about it in the prepared remarks, what we're seeing is not a direct correlation but a lot of correlation between currencies and commodities. And so every time you see a big spike in the strength of the dollar, you see commodities come off strongly and vice versa. So we're starting to see a natural hedge in offsets in the portfolio of currencies and commodities and we're looking at those together, and then looking at how we hedge them for the best results. So we'll go through that in February.\nJudy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. Just following up on that Gary and not getting into the 2012 outlook. But as we think about the price minus cost delta then, now that you've put in additional pricing in the third quarter, is the gap between pricing and cost now starting to narrow going forward? Have we sort of peaked in terms of that gap?\nGary P. Fayard: I think for this year, yes. But we've done a couple of things: We got very good pricing into the market in North America and we knew kind of what the commodities were going to be. We've done very well with mix as well, and so that's helped us. And we've done very well with accelerating the capture of synergies as well. And then those synergies are ongoing every year also. So we've done a good job. In fact, what I said on pricing in North America, we pointed out that pricing was plus 2 in North America, but plus 3 on Sparkling. And in fact, we're cycling -- this is a good news, bad news thing, so let me kind of go through it so you understand it. What we got is very good positive mix, particularly around packaging and you saw a lot of packaging initiatives in Houston. We've also got a negative mix in North America related to the DASANI. And this is actually good news, but at first blush you would think well negative, negative price mix on DASANI. What it is really where the PlantBottle has come through, with our customers really identifying it with it and our consumers and DASANI being relisted in quite a few national retailers. So it's really been a huge positive for us even though it put a little pressure on the price mix in the quarter. So it's a real positive.\nMuhtar Kent: And Judy, just one other point on a more global basis. You heard in my comments about how immediate consumption is such a big focus of ours around the world and how we're gaining traction. I think that has also helped us realize mix to our benefit and our bottlers particularly around the world as also where commodities have also been a challenge in many parts of the world. So that's worked in our favor also in the first 9 months of this year as we have had that very major focus on immediate consumption drive.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlos LaBoy from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nCarlos A. LaBoy - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Muhtar, when you look at the performance of Latin America beyond the execution model which you're replicating in many of your markets, what do you think moves these family -- on-bottlers to make these extraordinary efforts. In other words, what insights does Latin America hold for you on what the ultimate architecture of North America might look like in terms of roles, responsibilities, partnership principles and the intangible things that stand behind these execution models?\nMuhtar Kent: Well, I think it's a -- I mean, certainly the philosophy of execution is something that is coming into our North American business rapidly. I hope you were able to see first hand some of that when you were in Houston. But just go anywhere and you'll see differences. You'll see -- your eyes will pick up differences across the country. The philosophy, the belief in the business, the belief in the ability that where we can grow this business, that these per capitas are nowhere near to the ceiling and the belief that the inspiration is resonating, the marketing combined with execution will resonate and translate into a growth algorithm. It starts with that and I think there's great learnings not just from Latin America execution and family-owned bottling business or even larger bottling businesses in Latin America, but across many parts of the world whether it's in European Coca-Cola Hellenic territories, whether it's in Turkey and CCI territories, whether it's in some other territories in South Europe, Iberian Peninsula. There's that philosophy of execution that was lost to many to a great deal that extends to the United Stated and that's coming back. It's coming back rapidly and I think that's what gives us excitement about the future of our business here. Now in terms of your question related to Latin America per se and yes, we're very happy with our performance in Latin America both this past quarter as well as on a year-to-date basis. And again, it's a great portfolio of countries. You've seen Brazil slow down a little bit, naturally because we were cycling a very high number from prior year at 13%. But I think also at the same time, other countries are coming back to generate a very healthy result overall in our Latin American business. And I've also said this before and I want to reiterate, we're just starting with our Still Beverage business in Latin America. It's just the beginning of the journey and it's still at very low per caps and very low beginnings and there's a great future. As we continue to maintain the momentum in our Sparkling Beverage business in Latin America, the Still Beverage business, that growth is just going to come on top of that and that's what I think what we're building rapidly in Latin America both in our juice and juice drinks business, but also in our teas and Leaos, and other such still beverages.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Caroline Levy from CLSA.\nCaroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: I'd like to just ask about your opinion of the growth in the North American market over the next several years. Do we have to throw up our hands and say that as a market the industry can't grow, even though you can maybe get some brands growing within it? Or do you see hope for sparkling growth?\nMuhtar Kent: Well firstly, I think if you look at what we've been able to achieve here in our U.S. market, it's been growing since the second quarter of 2010. And it's really important to underscore that point that we are growing. So we have no reason to put our hands up, as you suggest. We totally, respectfully disagree that that's very far from where our mind is about the United States. And there's a number of reasons why we believe that. First, the demographics in North America are in our favor. They're the best demographics of any Western nation in the world. We're going to be adding between now and then of our vision term, 30 million people to the population of the United States. It'll have the third highest teen population. Everyone that has bet against the United States in the past have lost and I respectfully believe, very much so, that we'll get it right also from a macro perspective here. For the diversity of our population, the entrepreneurial spirit, the amount of university graduates that we attract from all around the world, the best. And so we have every reason to believe that this business -- that if we can't grow, it's our fault. Simple as that. And we won't accept that. And therefore, we are growing and we will continue to grow. We never said they we're going to grow at rates of China or India. We said that we'll generate moderate growth rates in America and that we will continue to improve our business and generate higher revenue than our volume and generate higher income than our revenue. So volume, moderate volume, better than the volume revenues and better than revenue income. That's our model, and we believe that, that model will work.\nCaroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: I appreciate the enthusiasm and the belief behind that. I'm just wondering, are there any specific brands in sparkling that you think have much more potential in North America?\nMuhtar Kent: Sparkling, firstly, brand Coke was even in North America in the last quarter. That I think is a huge achievement from where we were. Coke Zero continues to have double-digit growth. That's a huge benefit that we have and a great point of leverage. And our brands are stronger than ever before, metrics for our brands. And we believe that we can continue to accelerate both sparkling as well as still beverages. And POWERADE as you know, as you've heard is continuing to do very well. Our other still beverages are doing very well. So we believe that -- and we have the best brand metrics coming out of our still and sparkling beverage portfolio as a result of not just the investments we've made but also as a result of the execution.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Muhtar, as you head into this current quarter, you're seeing your FX benefit turn to being a negative and I suspect that's before you get any commodity benefit. So in light of that dynamic, how are you thinking about how you maintain support for your brands now that you're losing this FX benefit? And how does that affect your confidence in achieving your 6% to 8% operating income targets over the next year or so now that -- and of course now we'll be looking at KO without the noise, if you will, of the CC North America acquisition?\nMuhtar Kent: Well I'll let Gary also comment on the FX, but let me just say that we weren't dependent on it. No, you can't depend on FX. Depending on FX to support your brands is like taking off in a plane with the fuel gauge on. You can't do that. So you've got to make absolutely sure that you have a sustainable base that you can depend on to fuel your brands. And our transformation program, which is ahead of schedule and the last year that we've generated north of $500 million of savings. We've obviously channeled some of that into our brands to continue to fuel our brands. We have also -- are very ahead of our target of schedule in our North American integration and so the volatility of currency is something that changes faster than -- the rate of change of currencies is something that we haven't seen for a long time, and you cannot depend on that for ensuring that you have enough fuel for your brands. So we have other means to ensure that we have -- that we can continue to support our brands. And by the way, the cash position of our bottlers is better than ever before. And we continue to upgrade and increase and enhance our long-term investment programs that we've announced across the world. I was in China recently again where we announced a new investment program and actually when you -- when we concluded the 3-year investment program, we ended up spending more than we originally estimated in China for the 3 years gone back, the last 3 years. And that's because of our bottlers' belief in the future of the business. And that's happening across the world, so we have -- our bottlers financial and balance sheets are better than we've seen them for a long, long time. That fuels more investment in both plant equipment, machinery, cold drink and infrastructure and we are certainly reallocating money from our P&L into brand building in a very successful and meaningful and sustainable way.\nGary P. Fayard: Mark, this is Gary. Just a couple of comments on currency. Number one, what I was telling you was really just kind of based on where rates are today and our current hedge positions, et cetera, for the fourth quarter. I have probably 3 to 5 different scenarios of what could happen next year, both on currencies and on commodities. Number one, I would tell you that fundamentally, we believe that -- on the fundamentals, the dollar is actually probably over [Audio Gap] value, and would give us a benefit. I'm not projecting that right now because of the crisis going on in Europe and if they could just get their communications consistent, it'd probably help some of the volatility over there. But the dollar's overvalued, but it's overvalued because of fear right now in the financial markets. So with that said, long-term I think we probably benefit. Short-term, it probably hurts us a little bit. But also said, I think we're seeing offsets across commodities as well. So we'll just have to kind of wait and see how it goes. But the important thing to remember, I think, is that we run our business across the world in local currency. Their local currency, their local businesses and they generate local currencies and run them in local currency. And we do that because we are running this business for the long-term and not what happens in an FX market today or tomorrow.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: That's great. Muhtar, if you think about the targets, if we go back to the period before the purchase of CCE North America, we used to hear you comment we think the targets are reasonable for the coming year. What is your view of achieving the targets in '12 or over the near- to intermediate-term now that we no longer have the noise of CCE North America in the reported results?\nMuhtar Kent: Well, we've consistently met or exceeded our long-term growth targets, Mark. And I think that basically, and you need to understand that we also strive for our 2020 Vision targets which is doubling our system revenue by 2020 from a base of 2010. And coupled with those, as I said before -- as I mentioned before, we will continue to strive to ensure that we meet or exceed our long-term growth targets in every quarter as we operate through this difficult environment. And as I said also that there may be bumps, one or 2 bumps along the way and that's what we said also in the past. But over time and over the medium- and long-term, we have every reason to believe that we can continue to achieve our long-term growth targets and also meet our 2020 Vision targets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Muhtar, you detailed the strong immediate consumption trends in the quarter. Can you review the key drivers behind that growth and also going forward, the level of risk that you think potentially slowing macros here can have on immediate consumption trends?\nMuhtar Kent: Well, they've had an impact. Mobility has gone down, more people are moving towards in-house entertainment. But we saw those trends and we invested against those to ensure that we would actually continue to drive our immediate consumption business, whether it is on the streets of Italy or whether it's on the streets of Shanghai or in Africa. And so what does that entail? That entails more cold drink equipment, targeted cold drink equipment. That included a new architecture of packaging and pricing that would make it more attractive for on-the-go consumers to find packages that were affordable for them, and we did that in China and successfully in parts of Asia successfully, in many parts of Eurasia as we did here in America. And I think it's worked and you heard me just announce also that we'll be launching even more new on-the-go packages here in the United States. So this strategy of investment ahead of the curve in infrastructure, particularly in cold drink infrastructure, coupled with the intelligent progressive packaging moves, have helped us in this area and will continue to help us. And then lay on top of that also some innovative moves like the expansion of Freestyle across -- and Freestyle is now in 2 markets around the world as we speak, in the United States and Japan, and continuing to create a lot of excitement. And then also overlay on top of that other innovations like the PlantBottle and I LOHAS in Japan, driving results for us in the immediate consumption of convenience store channel. And so you get the picture, I hope.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMC.\nJohn A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just wanted to ask a question on Europe. It looks as though, sort of parsing through the different commentary, it looks as though sparkling volume growth was great but non-carbs weaker. Do you think that's -- is there a greater weather impact on the non-carbs side? Do you think that's an economic issue? Or in terms of maybe juices, whatever, being more expensive? Was it just sort of I have a big commodity bottled water business. Can you talk a little bit about the differentiation and growth between the non-carbs and the sparkling side in Europe?\nMuhtar Kent: Well, there wasn't a big differentiation to the extent that you mentioned. But there was a small differentiation and I would attribute that to the very cold weather, particularly in -- ready-to-drink teas and sports drinks do get impacted more so by the climatic conditions, and they were very severe compared to the year before. But I would look at the year-to-date and that in the year-to-date, there's absolutely no anomaly in that. So I wouldn't put too much into that.\nJohn A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then a quick question to Gary. Gary, you talked about sort of terming out some of your debt, going a little bit longer duration. Can you talk -- as you talked about the interest expense and interest income numbers, can you give us an update there and should we expect you to continue to term out some of this CP, et cetera?\nGary P. Fayard: John, we're still actually looking at that and have not made a decision whether we'll term out anymore of the debt or not at this point in time. What we're looking at on the interest income, interest expense by the way, is really just a translation impact of the exchange rates of how much the interest income translates into in dollars and that's the only impact we have actually hedged quite a bit of, economically, in terms of actual cash itself, to protect the dollar amount of the cash, if you will. But it does translate into fewer dollars of interest income. But on the terming of our commercial paper, we're still looking at it and we'll let you know as we go forward on that.\nJohn A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay and then, I apologize. One other quick question, which is you talked about having translation -- I think operating income hedges in place for most important currencies. And traditionally you've had a fairly narrow basket on the operating income line. Has that changed or are you now potentially hedging in some other currencies?\nGary P. Fayard: No, we're actually hedging in some other currencies. It hasn't changed and let me explain that. When we're looking at like a year or 2 years out or that kind of thing, it's basically hedged in the hard currencies, euros, sterling, et cetera, because to try to hedge a lot of emerging market currencies is just prohibitively expensive. However when you get into 3, 4, 5 months kind of out, you can actually then start putting hedges in place to lock in. So we do, on a shorter-term basis, actually hedge a lot of the other currencies as well.\nOperator: And our final question today comes from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.\nAlice Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: My question is a follow-up to currency combined with commodity trends. I mean, we can't know the magnitude or the timing of your hedging programs. Could you just give us some order of magnitude of the offset? In other words, can we assume that net of all your hedging, that commodity trends offset 30% of the currency hits next year or 50% or 80%? And is there a timing lag?\nGary P. Fayard: Yes. What I can do is I'll try to give you an update on that in February when we do the year-end call. And just to put some context around that, let me give you an example. If you look at the GAAP, non-GAAP schedules that we have that were released this morning with our earnings release, you'll see that where we take -- we have some hedges, commodity hedges, that are economic hedges but are not accounting hedges. And we put them in there and actually take the impact gain or loss out. If you look this quarter, there's actually $113 million of hedge losses, which means we've committed to buy some commodities, if you will, which -- at a price which on the last day of the quarter was more expensive than spot. As of today versus 2 weeks ago, half of that $113 million is gone and were actually just swung back the other way and that's what the volatility is doing today. So I think that's why we're saying we'll wait February. We'll give you a good, hopefully better outlook. Because as I said in one of the previous comments, we've got probably 5 different scenarios of what could happen on currencies and commodities going, and all of them pretty much going in different directions. So we'll give you a much better look then, because today I just can't do it.\nMuhtar Kent: Thanks Gary and Jackson. In closing, let me just reiterate that along with our bottling partners around the world, we're successfully advancing our global momentum during a time of ongoing global market volatility. Our system is financially strong. We continue to generate cash. We continue to invest for growth and pay a healthy dividend as well as retain financial flexibility. And while we are delivering quality results today, we also remain clearly focused on driving long-term sustainable growth in order to realize our 2020 Vision. Thanks for joining us this morning.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you so much for your participation.

Please look on our website for this information. Now I'll turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that we're pleased with our strong second quarter results, a quarter in which we delivered performance results ahead of our long-term growth targets, making this the fifth consecutive quarter we've either met or exceeded our long-term growth targets. We're winning in the marketplace, leveraging our strong brands, coupled with strong solid execution to gain volume and value share globally in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. We're winning with our Global Sparkling Beverage portfolio, led by brand Coca-Cola, which grew a solid 4% in the quarter.  We're winning with our Global Still Beverage portfolio, which was up 7% for the quarter and up 9% year-to-date, and we are achieving these results during a time of mixed economic recovery, which is a testament to our strong brands and solid business fundamentals.  Before I review our quarterly operating results in more detail, let me take a moment to share some further thoughts on today's mixed global economic landscape. The economic recovery is weak here in the United States as well as in Europe, Japan and across most of the developed western world. Many middle-class consumers, especially those in developed economies, are still feeling somewhat confused and fragile. At the same time, however, many emerging markets are doing quite well, especially those in Latin America, Eurasia, key countries like India, China and other fast-growing regions like Sub-Saharan Africa.  With this as a backdrop, our focus is on maintaining a long-term vision of where the world is headed and, in turn, where The Coca-Cola Company wants to go. For us, that road map for winning is represented by our 2020 Vision, a vision shaped together with our global bottling partners and a vision we are confident is ushering in a new era of winning, as we continue along the path to 2020. We estimate that by decade's end, there will be 1 billion new consumers entering into the middle class.  Additionally, massive urbanization will take place over the next 10 years, with another 800 million or so consumers moving to cities. These consumers are going to generate an increased demand for ready-to-drink nonalcoholic beverages, which is our business.  Yet with a vision, you also need a conviction and belief, followed by investment. To that end, we're investing for growth all around the world in alignment with our global bottling partners. We're investing in highly developed markets, such as North America, where we are both investing to support our brands via marketing as well as building new facilities, renewing existing facilities and upgrading our selling and execution capabilities.  In total, our system has made commitments to invest more than $25 billion over the next 5 years in markets all across the world. Our management's focus and our system-wide investments are paying off today, as we execute our 2020 Vision from a position of real strength. Turning now to our total company performance. We realized strong worldwide volume growth of 6% for both the quarter and year-to-date, including the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands, primarily Dr. Pepper brands in North America. Excluding these brands, our volume grew 5% for the quarter and year-to-date, ahead of our long-term growth target, with over 30% of this quarter's incremental growth generated in our BRIC markets. As for our profit results, we grew comparable earnings per share by 10% this quarter, bringing our year-to-date comparable earnings per share growth to 9% at the high end of our long-term growth target. Now let's briefly review performance results across our operating groups, beginning first with North America, our flagship market. North America volume was up 4% this quarter, with organic volume even versus prior years, cycling 2% organic growth from prior year. Importantly, North America gained both volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages this quarter, reaffirming our commitment to driving balanced growth.  Our investments in sparkling beverages in North America continued paying dividends, as we gained volume and value share in the Sparkling category this quarter. Coke Zero delivered double-digit volume growth in North America for the 21st consecutive quarter, while Fanta was up high-single digits in the quarter, building on its year-long positive momentum. We're also expanding the footprint of our innovative Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispenser. We're in 50 U.S. markets today, putting us well on track to meet our target to be in 80 markets by year end.  As far as still beverages in North America, we delivered positive growth and gained share for the fifth consecutive quarter. A leading driver of this growth was POWERADE, which delivered 9% growth and gained both volume and value share in the Sports Drink category this quarter. Our Energy portfolio saw double-digit volume growth in the quarter with our NOS Energy brand up a strong 13%. Our key portfolio delivered mid-single digit growth led by yet another quarter of double-digit volume increase for our Gold Peak brand, and our Simply brand delivered its 26th consecutive quarter of positive growth while also taking industry-leading pricing of 6% to 9%, offsetting commodity pressure. And we're making excellent progress with our ongoing integration at Coca-Cola Refreshments, which is proceeding as planned and has enabled strong execution of integrated marketing and commercial programs. So as a result, we remain confident that we have the right strategies and the right plans in place for North America, as we continue to be excited about the outlook for our business in this key market.  Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, where we are investing for growth across our markets. Overall, the Pacific Group volume was up 7% in the quarter, led by double-digit volume growth in China, up 21%, and South Korea, up 16%. Importantly, we gained both volume and value share in the Sparkling category with trademark Coca-Cola, up 4% in the Pacific Group for the quarter. In China, trademark Coca-Cola grew 23% this past quarter, its strongest growth since the second quarter of 2004. And in total, our year-to-date sales in China are now over 1 billion unit cases. Just to put this in context, our China business first delivered 1 billion unit cases for a full year in 2006, which means we doubled the size of our China business in just 5 years.  Looking ahead and as we have noted in previous earnings calls, we're introducing a wider variety of single-serve packages to our Sparkling Beverage portfolio in China. This is in line with our efforts to focus more on enhancing the consumer experience with our brand and promoting, at the same time, affordability. While this greater emphasis on single-serve packages may lead to some quarter-to-quarter volume fluctuation in the near term, it's also going to drive increased transactions and build brand equity. As such, we're confident we have the right strategies, execution plans as well as capabilities in place in China today to deliver sustainable double-digit growth.  Japan also delivered positive volume growth, up 1%, for the quarter despite the ongoing aftereffects of the tragic national disaster in March. This is a better result than we expected when we spoke to you about our Japan business in our last earnings call and is a testament to the strength as well as resilience of our Japanese bottling system. Having said that, we do expect to experience continued challenges in our Japan business during the balance of this year, as we cycle last year's record hot summer conditions and keep working through what is still a difficult environment. Gary is going to provide a more detailed update on our business in Japan later in our call. But looking beyond 2011, we have strong confidence in our business in Japan. This year alone, our great Japanese bottling system have announced investments totaling over $250 million for production capacity improvements, logistics facilities and equipment innovations. Moving now to Latin America. We continue to generate volume and profit growth across the region, with volume up 6% for the quarter, including 4% growth for brand Coca-Cola. We were able to capture this growth through a relentless focus on occasion-based consumer segmentation, combined with best-in-class customer service capabilities. These strategies which have served us so well in Latin America and many other markets around the world are the same ones, actually, we're now actively implementing in North America.  Latin America's broad-based growth was once again led by Mexico, up double digits for the quarter for both the quarter and year-to-date. Importantly, brand Coca-Cola keeps playing a significant role in driving growth for us in Mexico, up 7% for the quarter and 9% year-to-date. An interesting data point regarding Mexico this quarter is that our bottling partner, Coca-Cola FEMSA, sold 125 million unit cases in the month of May alone, the largest monthly sales volume in their history. That this historic milestone occurred in the same month that we were celebrating Coca-Cola's 125th anniversary is more than just a coincidence. It's a great testament to the remarkable system partnership we have in place in Mexico today.  Brazil volume was up 1% for the quarter, cycling double-digit growth and reflecting the macroeconomic slowdown, driven by the government's recent efforts to curb inflation. It's important to note that our business in Brazil continues to outperform the marketplace, gaining both volume and best value share in both sparkling, as well as still beverages. This provides us confidence that our strategies are working in Brazil and that we're well positioned to expand our share of industry growth in the years ahead. And our Argentina business delivered high-single digit quarterly and year-to-date growth, capturing volume and value share in both sparkling and still beverages. Turning now to Eurasia and Africa, where we are executing with excellence across a diverse geography. Volume grew 7% in the quarter, led by strong results in Turkey, Russia and India. Turkey was up 12% this quarter with brand Coca-Cola up 5% for the quarter and 10% year-to-date. Russia was up 9% this quarter and 16% year-to-date, led by brand Coca-Cola up 17% this past quarter, posting a sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.  India delivered quality results, growing 8% in both the quarter and year-to-date, making this the 20th consecutive quarter of positive growth for this key emerging market. Growth in India was balanced across our portfolio, with both sparkling and still beverages up 8% each.  Despite geopolitical challenges, our Middle East and North Africa business delivered 8% growth as we invest to strengthen our position in this region. We are also investing to enhance our competitive advantage across fast-growing countries in Sub-Sahara Africa. Our business in this region was up 6% this quarter, and we believe the opportunity for growth there is significant. GDP forecasts for the next 5 years indicate that of the 10 fastest-growing economies in the world, 7 will be located in Sub-Sahara Africa, making this region, in our view, the exciting S in BRICS.  As we move to Europe, the headline here is one of accelerated growth despite a challenging environment, economic environment. Volume was up 5%, marking Europe's fourth consecutive quarter of growth. Importantly, every region of our European business delivered positive growth this past quarter, benefiting from warmer weather, as well as excellent in-market activation of our 125th anniversary programs. Our sparkling beverages in Europe were up 5% for the quarter, with trademark Coca-Cola up 6%. And Coca-Cola Zero was up double digits for the third consecutive quarter.  Our still beverages were also up 5% in the quarter, driven by double-digit growth in energy beverages and high-single digit growth in teas. Additionally, the further expansion of the Innocent brand fueled our juice and juice drink growth.  While every region of our European business delivered volume growth this quarter, Germany led the way with 7%. Our German business benefited from the further evolution of our occasion-based package and price architecture and the successful execution of robust marketing programs centered on our 125th anniversary campaign. Our new marketing programs are also helping us recruit both lapsed consumers as well as a new generation of teens in this key European market.  As many of you know, our 2020 Vision outlines this strategic set of priorities across multiple dimensions. From time-to-time, we will take an opportunity in our earnings calls to highlight these priorities and share how we are advancing them. One of our priorities is to win at the point of sale by expanding our investments in immediate consumption. Year-to-date, we're seeing strong momentum against this priority with our immediate consumption beverages up 5% globally. And while many still beverage categories contributed to this growth, our Immediate Consumption Sparkling Beverages are up 4% year-to-date. Importantly, each geographic operating group is growing our Immediate Consumption Beverage business on a year-to-date basis. As the world becomes more urbanized and as more consumers begin to lead on-the-go mobile lifestyles, we see great runway ahead for us in profitable Immediate Consumption growth.  In closing, we're working closely together with our global bottling partners. And the strength of our alignment not only enables us to navigate the current economic and consumer landscape, it also puts us in a position of real strength to deliver our 2020 Vision. Despite the mixed economic recovery all around the globe, consumers are increasingly choosing our brands to refresh themselves at a rate of over 1.7 billion servings every day and growing. Our strong revenue and profit results, combined with our worldwide volume and value share gains and positive price mix, attest to the strength of our global system.  During this past quarter, we officially celebrated Coca-Cola's 125th anniversary. And while it is wonderfully rewarding to celebrate our past, we remain constructively discontent and resolutely focused on our exciting future. With our 2020 Vision as our road map, we will continue to execute our strategies with more focus and passion than ever before. That is why, as we look ahead to 2020 and beyond, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term target and to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and value for our shareholders. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Gary.\nGary Fayard: Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our performance this quarter, as we delivered results ahead of our long-term growth targets. And we're achieving these results during a time of mixed economic recovery, which is a real testament to our global system's ability to execute our strategic plans in alignment with our 2020 Vision.  So let's review our earnings results in more detail. As Muhtar said, we reported comparable earnings per share of $1.17 this quarter, up 10% versus the prior year. This brings our year-to-date comparable earnings per share growth to 9%, at the high end of our long-term growth target.  For the quarter, comparable operating income was up 18%. This includes a 6% benefit from currencies and higher commodity cost. This brings our year-to-date comparable operating income growth to 14%, including a 4% currency benefit and the commodity headwinds.  Our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 47% this quarter, including a 6% increase in concentrate sales, a 6% currency benefit, positive price mix and the impact of a CCE transaction. On a year-to-date basis, our comparable net revenue growth was 44%, including a 5% increase in concentrate sales, a 4% currency benefit, positive price mix and the impact of the CCE transaction.  Our combined International and Bottling Investments Group price mix was a positive 2% this quarter, and our second quarter pricing to retailers in North America was up between 1% and 2%. To be clear, this is our best estimate of the increased pricing our retail customers pay for our brands.  In our meetings with you this past quarter, some of you asked for additional detail regarding our 2011 North America retail pricing strategy. We believe in executing pricing within a disciplined commercial framework that considers rate increases, together with occasion-based package mix levers, balancing overall category health with volume, value and retail pricing growth. So let me update you on the rest-of-year outlook with respect to our North America retail pricing strategy.  As we said in our last earnings call, we expect to capture between 3% and 4% incremental retail pricing in the back half of 2011, leading to a net full year benefit of between 2% and 3%. We can confirm that we have put into effect incremental pricing programs with many of our customers for the rest of this year that will enable us to deliver against this full year retail pricing target. As such, our 2011 North America retail pricing strategy is laser-focused on driving profitable growth, leveraging both rate and mix levers and to not just take price, but to earn retail price ahead of inflation and at a premium to our industry.  Our system has done this successfully and consistently in North America, not just this quarter and not just this year, but on a sustainable year-over-year basis. And I can assure you that we will continue to execute our retail pricing strategies to deliver maximum long-term value, not only to our consumers and our customers, but especially our shareowners. Turning now to our P&L. Our comparable currency-neutral SG&A expenses were up 47% in the quarter and 48% year-to-date. As we did last quarter, I'll take a moment to review our consolidated SG&A results by operating segment to provide you with a little more context and insight on our results.  First and as expected, North America's SG&A reflects an increase due to our acquisition of CCE's North American business, including the application of The Coca-Cola Company's sales curve accounting policy to the related CCE North America marketing expenses, as I detailed in our last earnings call. We expect this increase and its corresponding impact on operating expense leverage to remain in place until we fully cycle acquisition of CCE's North American business.  Second, our Bottling Investment Group's SG&A was up 5% on a comparable currency-neutral basis, excluding the impact of structural items for both the quarter and year-to-date. This is also to be expected as we continue to make strategic investments in key markets where we see strong long-term growth potential.  Third, our international operating segment's SG&A reflects increased direct marketing expenses, as we further invest in the health and strength of our brands. And finally, as expected, our currency-neutral corporate expenses are up double digits for the quarter and year-to-date due to the inclusion of corporate expenses related to CCE's North American operations and other investments, primarily in IT. While we consider these collective SG&A increases and the higher commodity costs observed this year, we expect full year operating expense leverage to be negative for North America and our Bottling Investment Group as anticipated, since both are finished goods businesses. As for our international operations, we expect our operating expense leverage to be even for the full year, as we strategically sustain our brand-building investments around the world.  And for our year-to-date cash flow from operations, this came in at $3.6 billion or $668 million less than in the comparable period last year. Part of this is attributable to the inclusion of CCE's North America business in our results, a business which is historically a net user of cash in the first half of the year. In addition, this cash flow results includes a $769 million contribution made to our pension plans in the first quarter of this year, as discussed in our last earnings call. Net of the pension plan contributions, cash flow from operations were actually up 2% year-to-date.  Now let me take a moment to update our 2011 outlook, starting with how we are successfully managing the current currency and commodity environment, as both of these items have tended to move in opposite directions this year, serving to partially offset each other's impact. Since our last earnings call in April of this year, currencies have continued to fluctuate. In response, we have increased our coverage of most key currencies for the remainder of the year and now expect currencies to have a mid-single digit positive impact on operating income for the full year.  As for commodities, we still expect these to have an unfavorable impact of approximately $700 million on our full year results, in line with the same full year forecast we shared last quarter. As communicated earlier, we are implementing retail price increases with our customers who are also pulling forward cost-saving initiatives to help offset some of these commodity cost.  We continue to actively hedge our commodity and currency exposures. We also continue to reflect the impact of gains or losses resulting from mark-to-market of derivatives, which do not qualify for hedge accounting in the period that the underlying transaction takes place. As a result, in this quarter, we recognized a net $26 million of previously deferred gains primarily related to commodity hedging and have called these out in the schedules and notes to our GAAP/non-GAAP schedule.  Now let me share our latest views on how we see our recent events in Japan influencing our full year results. As Muhtar mentioned, our second quarter results in Japan came in stronger than anticipated after the earthquake and tsunami. Having said that and consistent with what we shared in our last earnings call, we still expect events in Japan to dilute our full year comparable earnings per share by between $0.03 and $0.05, with this impact primarily in the third and fourth quarters.  Finally, let me update you on our efforts across several of our ongoing programs starting with our company-wide productivity initiatives launched at the start of 2008. Our original plan, you may remember, target to capture $400 million to $500 million in annualized savings by the end of 2011. Today, I can confirm that we are on track to slightly exceed the upper end of this target by year end, the final year of this 4-year program. With regard to synergies related to our CCE transaction, we can also reaffirm our commitment to capture between $140 million and $150 million of net cost synergies in 2011.  As for our share repurchase program, we limited the number of shares purchased this past quarter, as we considered strategic alternatives. For those of you who model our business, this will represent approximately $0.01 difference between our earnings per share results and your own model's estimates. On a year-to-date basis, our share repurchase now stands at $1.1 billion, although some of these repurchases have been offset by the exercise of employee stock options. At this time, we are planning to purchase at least 2.5 billion in shares this year and plan to accelerate our share repurchase efforts, as needed, to achieve this target by year end.  Now let me add a few notes regarding several other line items. First for the full year, we expect net interest income, up $30 million to $40 million. This full year forecast implies a lower level of net interest income for the remaining 2 quarters of this year, driven by our expectation for slightly higher interest rates on our debt in the downhill and the effect of other debt activities we're evaluating, including the conversion of some of our commercial paper balances to long-term debt. Lastly, our underlying effective tax rate now stands at 24%.  In closing, we are greatly encouraged to see our business deliver yet another quarter of solid volume, revenue, profit and earnings results. Our seasoned management team and our highly capable global bottling partners are clearly taking the right actions and executing the right strategies to drive our 2020 Vision and advance our global momentum.  Operator, we're now ready for questions, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Carlos LaBoy from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nCarlos LaBoy - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG: Two quick questions, one on Japan. To what do you attribute this Q2 strength? And why is Q3 and Q4 still worrisome, if the dislocation's been in evidence since Q2? And to Muhtar, I was hoping you could speak to some of the bottling issues. So many of your key bottlers around the world right now are cash-rich. They're looking to deploy cash for growth. Can you speak to how you gauge and maximize this opportunity? What do you tell these bottlers, if you really don't seem to be ready to shed the bottler investment group operations, if they're still hungry to invest more? Do you worry that you need more growth opportunities for these bottlers?\nMuhtar Kent: I'll take your second question first. Let me just say that you heard me say that we're looking at investing $25 billion with our bottling partners in the next 5 years. As I said on CNBC this morning, too, the fact that we are generating a good quarter now is not only a result of the good execution and the focus on -- the laser focus on the priorities and executing against those priorities and the strategies. It's about the investments that we made 6, 7, 8 quarters ago and that we continue to make both in our brands, in innovation capabilities, in distribution capabilities, in route-to-market, in equipment and in enlarging the production base. When you look at the base that we have in a country like China today and generating the kind of growth we are generating on that base, you need significant infrastructure investments in a market just to deliver that kind of volume incrementally on top of the huge base. And that holds true for Africa, that holds true for Latin America, all of the higher growth markets. So we are in Turkey. We're investing very heavily with our bottling partners in Asia, in Latin America, in Africa, in Eurasia. And I think the testament, the best litmus test again for the health of our business is our bottlers' appetite for additional investments with us as well as, of course, appetite for additional territory. And we have both, and that's a very good sign in our business. But primarily, our bottling partners are seeing with us tremendous opportunities for continued growth. That growth cannot come without conviction, belief, followed by investment that generates -- and then well-executed that generates the growth that we're getting. So I think today, the investments that we're making in this -- that we made in this past quarter, while we delivered a good quarter, are going to pay off in the coming quarters. So that's the way you need to think about it. And then secondly, on Japan, look, I think our Japanese bottling partners have been very quick to come together and investing and ensuring that we have -- we\u2019re supplying the market ahead of the trends, ahead of the consumer demand, ahead of the customers' expectations. And that's what we have been doing very successfully in Japan, rationalizing SKUs, which we have done in order to ensure that we can navigate through the current restrictions in energy and other areas that the country is going through. And we're playing our part just like also some innovative mechanisms to save more energy on our cooler base, cold drink base in Japan that we've done and implemented successfully and have received also great words of support from the government, local and federal in Japan. But look, we're cycling a quarter, like, coming quarter of 11%, due to the very, very unusually hot climatic conditions that existed there in Q3 next year -- last year. And so, as we look forward into H2, the second half of the year, we see a very challenging cycle, but also ongoing issues around energy, around opening hours for retailers and the like. But look, over time, we see all of this being normalized, and the good news is that we are ahead of where we thought we would be today when we talked to you 3 or 4 months ago. And that\u2019s, I think, the key message about our Japanese business that you need to take away. And I think, as we did with the global macroeconomic crisis, we haven't wasted the current crisis in Japan. We've used it to become stronger, to become -- to invest further and to ensure that our brands also are very healthy and successful. And again, the $250 million investment, system investment by our bottling partners in Japan, is another great testament to that. So that's what I\u2019d like to leave you with.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Pecoriello from Consumer Edge Research.\nWilliam Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: Muhtar, I wanted to focus a little bit more on China. You mentioned a wider variety of single-serve packages rolling out. Can you talk specifically about what you're rolling out there that might cause some lumpiness in the quarterly growth? Also, if you could put some numbers around the accelerated cooler penetration that you referred to? And on the distribution gains, are you still growing in the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities? Or is the majority of that growth and distribution coming in the lower-tier cities?\nMuhtar Kent: I think it's fair to say that in China, our business, the industry continue to evolve at a very high speed. And again, we're introducing a wider variety of packages choice to promote both affordability as well as enhancing the Chinese consumer experience with our brands, all really in a way to focus to drive increased transactions. I think that is a great -- we're looking increasingly at the health of the business through increased transactions and also profitable growth and to continue building both brand equity with our consumers. So as 1 of the only 2 multicategory beverage players in China, the measure of our success will be how we grow our total business between now and 2020 versus our growth in any particular quarter. And clearly, I think with the consumer fundamentals and our strong position in China, we're just getting started, I believe, in this region. And we're investing for the long term. And we're ahead of our investment announced of $2 billion over the 3-year period starting with 2009 through \u201911. And the key strategies and initiatives are to expand our portfolio and packaging, continue to invest in our distribution system and to invest aggressively in Cold Drink. You asked about Cold Drink. This year, probably, we'll be placing more cold drink equipment than we've ever done in our history, for sure. And then, we are getting growth increasingly in Tier 3, but also continue to grow our business vertically, as well as slightly horizontal growth in Tier 1 and Tier 2. And important to note, also, brand Coca-Cola was up 24% in the past quarter in China, and we're excited with the focus paying off, as well as with the packaging strategy paying off and our strategy of improving, enhancing consumer experience paying off in China.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Faucher from JPMC.\nJohn Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Just first, a point of clarification from Gary. Gary, if you're telling us about these discussions and you're telling us that you are going to resume share repurchase, is it fair to say then that whatever discussions you were having in the second quarter are no longer operative? And then the second piece would -- could you give us an update in terms of, it sort of falls in with some of Bill's comments about the single-serve in China, as you look at this progression to transactions over the next 12 months or so, how should we be modeling this out? Is it going to be something where the price mix will get a lot better and the volume will go down, just so we can manage expectations there? Or volume estimates will go down, but then the profitability should get a little bit better there? So can you walk us through how we should think about that longer term?\nMuhtar Kent: Let me take your question on China, John, and then over to Gary.\nJohn Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co: It was actually more globally, not just the China piece. Actually probably more the U.S. in terms of the transactional piece and the price packaging architecture.\nMuhtar Kent: Right. And that is fundamental to the health of our business, overall, and our ability to deliver sustainable profitable growth, and think of it as a soft landing. This is not about taking, going down path and altitude, and creating indigestion and headaches for people in the plane. It's all about ensuring that we can fine-tune our business, and consumer-led pricing is the key and choice is the key. And portion packs are working very well for us across wherever we've introduced them selectively and with surgical focus, whether it's in the United States, whether it's in Europe, Latin America or China. And I think, a great, again, indicator of health of our business is growth of transactions. And where volume grows and transactions do not grow at the same rate, business needs to be fine-tuned. We have that philosophy and we implement that philosophy without -- with ensuring that we always have soft landings. And that it's a mix of happiness when you have -- when you're able to increase transactions as well as increase your volume and also your share. And that's the position we'd like to see ourselves in every market, and that's what I'd like to just leave you with. And as far as you asked about where do we see this in terms of China, I think the issue, the picture of success there again is to keep growing the volume, but also ensuring that we can generate commensurate growth in transactions, without disrupting the business, as we implement this strategy and this -- execute with focus. And over to Gary now for your other question.\nGary Fayard: John, on share repurchase, first, just for everyone's clarification, if you are engaged in anything that would be material inside information, the securities laws in this country would preclude you from buying your own shares. And we were looking at some strategic alternatives during the quarter. And therefore, we thought it prudent to not be in the market during that time. I can confirm that as of today, there is nothing that would preclude us from re-entering the market to repurchase our shares, now that the earnings release is out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Gary, on commodities, could you give us a sense of how hedged you are looking for 2012? And if we were to assume commodities stay where they are through 2012, what kind of annual increase we might see? I assume it's a number less than the $700 million this year, but what kind of number might we see next year?\nGary Fayard: Yes, Mark, well, number one, we are putting coverage into place in 2012. It is not all in place because we would normally be entering into those contracts now and through the fall, as we're doing our business planning and all. I guess the impact, it's hard to tell you the impact today, because there's a lot of volatility and the prices aren't locked in. What I can tell you though is particularly on some of the commodities, let's say corn, we have very favorable hedge contracts in place today for 2011. And that's included in the calculation of the $700 million. So don't expect to see anything like $700 million next year. But we will be then cycling in certain of those commodities, some favorable hedge positions that we had this year. But with all that said, I'd say there's going to be some commodity pressure next year. It's not going to be anything like, based on what we know today, like it is this year. And I'm talking more U.S. now, because obviously, since all of these are dollar-based commodities on the international side, a lot of that then gets offset by currency, the way currencies have been moving recently. So I'd say there's going to be some pressure next year, but nothing like we've seen this year.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, and if I could follow up on PET, specifically, what is your view in terms of where that commodity specifically is heading?\nGary Fayard: On PET, I think, number one, you would think because it's plastic and most of it historically has been sourced out of petroleum, that it would be closely linked to the price of oil, and it's actually not. It's really -- there are 2 main ingredients that go into making the plastic itself. There is a real supply-demand relative to those 2 ingredients and there's a global shortage of one of those. By the way, that -- this is more than you probably want to know. But a lot of that relates to the price of cotton, of all things, because -- and price of cotton, as you know, this past year has been kind of historic highs. What that means is that in clothing, a lot of the clothing will start going toward polyester versus cotton. That puts the demand side on polyester comes from the same source as PET, and that's what's given a lot of the pressure this year to PET resin. I think there\u2019ll still be some pressure on it, but I don't see a lot more upward pressure into next year at this point. I guess the one thing I would say as well, I think that's where it's really important, not only from an environmental and a consumer point of view, our PlantBottle, which in our PlantBottle, 30% of the ingredient now coming from renewable sources from plants versus petroleum. And as we go forward, I think, and looking at increasing capacity in that, we can continue to increase our packaging of the PlantBottle globally. That can help us not only environmentally, but also on the commodity costs side. So this is one of those where you can do good and do better because of both consumer and costs.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. And it sounds like you're saying you don't expect PET to go up. There\u2019s some who think it's actually going to be going down pretty nicely here as the cotton comes in. Do you have a view on it actually going down later this year? Or is it too soon to say?\nGary Fayard: It's too soon to say, I'd say, right now. I'll try to give you some more on that end of the third quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christine Farkas, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nChristine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch: A regional question, if I could. First thing on Europe, I'm seeing or we're seeing very strong growth there. And Muhtar, you talked about all the regions supporting that growth. Can you comment a little bit about Southern Europe and Italy, Spain, Greece, and how you might be executing there to drive potentially positive volumes in this environment? And also confirm the pace of Eastern Europe, if that is, in fact, turning. And then on the Philippines, very tough cycles there and macro conditions. I'm wondering if you can also highlight how that business performs.\nMuhtar Kent: Yes, Christine. I think Europe, we're obviously pleased with the result, given the macro conditions in Europe, overall. As I said before, Europe is not as uniform as, say, Japan or the United States in terms of the economic recovery. There are regions of Europe that really are not doing badly at all. Germany is one. The exports are still booming out of Germany. The German economic growth is leading the rest of the countries in Europe. Great Britain is sort of pretty much in the middle, and then you've got the sort of Eastern Europe coming back, although not coming back very strongly. But there are signs of Eastern Europe, Central Europe, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, then also Romania and Bulgaria and former Yugoslavia, Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro and former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, all of those places coming back and we expect that to continue, Poland as well. But the real issue still continues to be in terms of consumer confusion and lots of missed, and consumers being extremely cautious in the southern part, in Spain, Italy also, Greece, Spain, being Spain and Portugal. But we were pleased to see that Spain grew this past quarter, and we see the programs that we're putting into place with our bottlers, the investments in our brands, paying off. And we do believe that we're going to strive to continue growing in Europe on the back of these 4 consecutive quarters. France, of course, is a great performance. We've had cycling 8%, growing 8%. Germany, again, cycling growth and growing, and Great Britain more moderate growth, and then Spain up in the mid-single digits. So we're very positive about that. And then Philippines, Christine, obviously a very, very challenging environment in the Philippines, with the aftereffects of food inflation still lingering on. There was a lot of hot money that came into the Philippines' economy back about 4 quarters ago, back during the election, and I think we're cycling that period. But the good news is that we're doing the right things in the Philippines, investing in our brands, gaining market share in the Philippines in both sparkling and still beverages, and getting stronger in the Philippines. And therefore, when the current environment stabilizes, and we do believe that we're going to come out of the tunnel stronger and better in the Philippines, where our penetration is growing in all different socioeconomic retail outlets, as well as driving volume and value share and brand health getting better for both Coca-Cola as well as our allied brands, Sprite and Fanta, but also for our still beverage brands.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.\nCaroline Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: Just a little bit of detail, if I might, on the situation in Russia, because I thought the acquisition of Nidan would have added about 10 points of volume growth. So is the base business healthy in Russia? Is the consumer in good shape? And then secondly, if you could look at juice in the U.S., it sounds like volumes were very soft, because you took pricing up. And I was just wondering if profits were also soft, in other words, the margin pressure offset the pricing.\nGary Fayard: Caroline, I think as we look in 2011, some underlying trends have slowed somewhat. Consumers are still cautious in Russia. But we had a very strong Q1 with volume up 27%, strong share gains. And then this quarter again, we're driving our core brands, which are much more profitable and they're a very healthy brand, Coke up 17%, Fanta up much higher than that, almost double, higher than 30% growth since the relaunch of Orange, with both natural colors as well as ingredients. And I think the juice category suffered the most in the economic crisis. So Multon was challenged, but we should see improvement in Q4, going forward, as both Multon integration continues and the Nidan operation continues to perform above our expectations. And we've continued to gain market share again in the second quarter, both in sparkling as well as still beverages. And we're again cautiously pleased with the strength of our core brands, which are really the foundation for our success to become a bigger player in NARTD in Russia, going forward, than where we are today. And I think we need to continue to drive our core brands in the way we're doing. And that's generating again much better also revenues for us in Russia, as a system with our bottling partners. Now concerning juices in the United States, I signaled in my script that we led pricing with Simply, 6% to 9%. Certainly the commodity pricing for fruit was a challenge, going forward. We put that behind us, and we still generated growth in our Simply brand. And we believe that we have the right propositions in juice going forward in the United States, and that we will continue to drive profitable growth in our juice business, both at the higher end with Simply and Odwalla, but also at the more mid-range, with all the innovations that are taking place with Minute Maid that we're in the marketplace with.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: A couple of questions from me. First, Gary, is there any way we can bridge the North American profit? Obviously, the CCE acquisition really makes it tricky. If I just kind of look at your Q1 performance versus Q2, it seems like profit, incremental profit you got in Q2 versus the revenue growth was actually a lot better. So I'm just wondering if there's any way we can kind of think about how much acquisition added, some of the cost savings, the commodity versus pricing delta? If there's any way we can kind of walk through those in more detail, I\u2019d really appreciate it.\nGary Fayard: Judy, if I could give you that, I would then have to admit to Muhtar that I could give it to him as well. And the issue -- what you're asking for are pro formas, basically, so that you can actually break it apart and see it. And the difficulty with pro formas that -- it\u2019s what I explained to North American leadership within the company, to Muhtar and now to you, is that because of the integration, it wasn't just an acquisition, we truly integrated the businesses where the Juice business is now inside of CCR, the Food Service business is inside of CCR and the Food Service team is now selling both fountain as well as bottle/can as well as juice products. So I can't pro forma and pull it all apart, to actually give you those pieces. So basically, all I can do is try to give you kind of the detail we've given you on the call, and then just ask for your indulgence and patience until we cycle through all of it, 2 more quarters, and then next year, it will all look normal.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: If I just could then maybe think about from a timing perspective, would Q2 have been the most pronounced in terms of commodity versus the pricing gap?\nGary Fayard: Yes, in that in Q3, Q3 would really be probably the biggest quarter, additional pricing went in, in Q3. And commodities are going to -- the commodity increases are kind of in there already. So I think your logic is correct.\nMuhtar Kent: But just a couple of points to add to that, Judy. Number one, I think if you look at the overall business where volume was up, excluding the cross-licensed brands, 5% comparable increases in concentrate and then currency added to that and then price mix, 2 points of price mix across our core business around the world. That is something that again, in this environment, we\u2019re cautiously pleased with. So that's an important point. The second, I think, point is that in the U.S. business, we talked to you about 1% to 2% price increase in sort of the first quarter. I think it's fair to say that we have taken actions in the marketplace. And we just have to now turn, go through it and implement it effectively in the second half. But we have taken measures for another 3% to 4% price increase generating probably a rate increase of, overall, for the full year of 2% to 3%. And I think anything on price mix will come on top of that. That's where we are in the U.S. business. And I think you will see us, you'll see that being reflected in the marketplace. I certainly, as I go into the marketplace, see that reflected. I was in the marketplace in the West Coast as well as on the East Coast this past 10 days, and I see that coming into play. And that is something that\u2019s important as we continue to execute and with focus on the second half of the year, as we move into our third quarter now.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay and if I could just follow up, Muhtar, just some comment about the premium pricing in North America versus the industry. Is the plan really using the packaging mix to kind of widen that premium pricing? Or is it really just looking at even the same packaging versus the competitors? Or do you think that your brand equity's strong enough that you can actually get premium pricing?\nMuhtar Kent: Well, premium pricing is all relative. It's all based on the price packaging channel, architecture. And I think at the end of the day, if that translates into a higher number for you or an incremental number on top of the rate increase that I talked about, which is on average for the full year, 3 or 4, but for the second half, 3 to 4, and for the full year, 2 to 3; then that is certainly a benefit that we would be looking for and we will be executing against. But again, all the time, all the time, I repeat, consumer-led pricing as opposed to just costs-led, and because it's a balance that is really critically important. And also, the value share gain is something that is right on top of the radar screen for us.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. And, Gary, just a quick clarification on share buyback comment again. So when you said, as of today, there's nothing to preclude you from buying back stock, is it the earnings release that triggers you to be in the open market? Or was the comment really that all deals, the strategic alternatives that you were looking at, you're done with that discussion and that you can move on now?\nGary Fayard: Yes, Judy, thanks for the question. There are 2 things that can keep you out of the market. One is if you're looking at strategic alternatives that are material insider information and that can be either in the U.S. or internationally, and then when we go into a quiet period where the numbers actually come in for the quarter. And what I'm saying is that we are free to reenter the market on both counts today.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Gary, Jackson. In closing, we had a strong second quarter and delivered solid mid-year performance. We're executing our 2020 Vision, advancing our global momentum by working closely with all of our key stakeholders. We're deploying our cash to invest in our brands, grow our global business and reward our shareholders. We're on track to deliver against our long-term growth targets and remain intently focused on working across our system to execute our key strategic priorities and generate long-term sustainable growth. Our proven track record of creating value over time is a testament to this dynamic commercial enterprise, as well as business, that has only just begun to reach its potential.

Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Media participants should contact Coca-Cola Media Relations department if they have questions. I would now like to introduce Mr. Jackson Kelly, Vice President and Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Kelly, you may begin.\nJackson Kelly: Good morning, and thank you for being with us today. I'm joined by Muhtar Kent, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Fayard, our Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report. In addition, I would also like to note that we have posted schedules on our company website at www.thecoca-colacompany.com under the Reports and Financial Information tab in the Investors section, which reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to by our senior executives in our discussion this morning and from time to time in discussing our financial performance to our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Please look at our website for this information. Now I will turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased with our first quarter results. Despite ongoing global geopolitical challenges, we once again delivered consistent quality growth across all 5 of our geographic operating groups. We are winning share in the marketplace. We gained volume and value share globally in our nonalcoholic beverages as well as in both the sparkling and still ready-to-drink beverage categories. We are winning with our global sparkling beverage portfolio. Brand Coca-Cola grew 3% in the quarter. In addition, Fanta is our fourth global brand to surpass the $10 billion retail sales value threshold.  And we are winning with our global still beverage portfolio, as Del Valle, the brand we acquired in 2007 recently, achieved $1 billion dollar brand status. Del Valle is now our company's 15th $1 billion brand and our first with roots in Latin America. Importantly, we are decisively executing our 2020 Vision, together with our global bottling partners and delivering consistent, long-term sustainable growth. Before we review this quarter's operating results, I'd like to take a moment to address recent events in Japan in light of last month's tragic earthquake and tsunami. First, I'd like to acknowledge and sincerely thank our leadership team in Japan for their tireless efforts in helping to ensure the health and safety of our associates and the people of Japan during this time of crisis. I'd also like to express our heartfelt appreciation to all of our Japan bottling partners who've been at the very forefront of our system's efforts to assist with immediate disaster relief. Our bottling partners have been diligently producing, distributing beverages to affected areas and restoring our business operations.  Last month, days following the earthquake and tsunami, I visited Tokyo to meet with our associates, customers and our bottling partners to gain first-hand insight into the initial rebuilding efforts. Given our nearly 60-year presence in Japan and our deep connection with its people, we are committed to doing everything we can to help the recovery, relief and rebuilding of this great country. To date, we have pledged $31 million to the ongoing relief efforts including donations of over $7 million bottles of product. Through our Coca-Cola Japan Reconstruction Fund, we're going to help rebuild schools and community facilities all across the country. As for our business in Japan, we can confirm that outside of the hardest-hit regions in North and East Japan, our system's bottling operations have been only minimally impacted, and all eight bottling plants in the region most affected by the earthquake are now back up and running. We have also announced plans to reduce our power usage this summer in East Japan mostly in vending machines to ensure we are responsive to the needs of the community, while ensuring our machines stay on and in support of small businesses which rely on the vending channel. With regard to this quarter's results in Japan, our volume was up 1%, gaining volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, reflecting the strong momentum our Japan business built across our portfolio in the time prior to the earthquake and tsunami. In light of recent events, we are actively reevaluating our Japan business plan to ensure we will restore and sustain our momentum and meet evolving customer and consumer needs.  As this topic is top-of-mind for many of our shareowners, Gary will review later in our call a very early estimate of the full year impact these recent events may have on our business in Japan. And be assured that in the coming months, we will keep providing routine and ongoing updates regarding Japan. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we navigate through this evolving operating environment. Turning now to our total company performance results. Our volume grew 6% for the quarter including the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands, primarily Dr. Pepper brands in North America. Excluding these brands, our quarterly volume grew a strong 5% ahead of our long-term growth target and fueled by organic volume growth in all 5 geographic operating groups. We are happy about these results and confident about our future as we achieve these performance results despite natural disasters, political uncertainties and a global macroeconomic environment still in recovery and pressured by rising inflation and commodity prices. As the global recovery and greater volatility continue, we may see some bumps along the way as we've seen in the past. However, our strong brands and solid business fundamentals provide us with confidence that we will continue to meet and exceed our long-term growth targets. Now let's review our performance results across our global markets in more detail beginning with North America, our flagship market. North America volume was up 6% this quarter with organic volume growth of 2%, excluding the benefit of our new cross-licensed brands. This marks a fourth consecutive quarter of positive organic growth for North America. And importantly, North America once more gained volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages this quarter.  In the United States, trademark Coca-Cola gained share, while Diet Coke was named the #2 sparkling beverage right behind our #1 brand, Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola Zero once again delivered double-digit volume growth in North America for the 20th consecutive quarter. Both Sprite and Fanta continued to grow in North America, up 3% and 5%, respectively, this past quarter. These successes reaffirm that our system is executing the right strategies and taking the right actions to sustainably drive long-term growth across our entire North America sparkling beverage portfolio. Turning to North America still beverages. I'm pleased to report 8% growth for the quarter. We have now grown volume share for our still beverages for 13 of the past 15 quarters and value share for 14 of the last 15. Our North America juices and juice drink business delivered positive growth this quarter, fueled once again by our Simply brand which grew 20%. This marks the 17th consecutive quarter that Simply has gained both volume and value share in the U.S.  Our glac\u00e9au brands gained volume and value share this quarter growing 12%, with our vitaminwater trademark up high single digits and smartwater up double digits. POWERADE delivered impressive results, growing 21% this past quarter and, once again, outperforming the North America sports drink category.  Our North America tea business extended its momentum, delivering 12% growth for the quarter.  We also completed a transaction that began 3 years ago by acquiring the remaining interest in Honest Tea, the nation's top-selling organic bottled tea company. We are excited to fully welcome this great and innovative brand to our family.  In total, our results in North America are a testament to how well our new leadership team and operating structure are working. We remain clearly focused on our integration efforts, which are proceeding as planned. At the same time, we're leveraging our strong marketing and sales capabilities to accelerate our leadership position within North America and to deliver profitable and sustainable growth. Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which was up 5% in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in both China and Korea and gaining share in both sparkling and still beverages. Our return to double-digit growth in China was driven by the effective execution of our Chinese New Year programs and sustained investment in our brands across multiple categories. As a result, our sparkling beverages gained share and grew double digits in China this quarter. This growth was led by trademark Coca-Cola and trademark Sprite, with both also growing double digits. In fact, our sparkling beverage share in China is now at the highest level we've seen in over 2 years.  Our still beverages in China also gained share and grew double digits this quarter, led by Minute Maid Pulpy, which was up 27%. As discussed in our last earnings call, we are introducing a wider variety of packages in China to promote affordability and enhance the consumer experience with our brands, all with the focus to drive increased transactions and to build brand equity. In support of this strategy, we launched the new single-serve 300 ml package for our sparkling beverages across parts of the country and have plans to introduce a 500 ml offering nationwide this summer. Moving now to Latin America. Volume grew a strong 7% for the quarter including 5% growth for brand Coca-Cola. Latin America's broad-based growth was led by Mexico, our highest global per capita market and a market sometimes overlooked because of its consistently solid performance. This quarter, Mexico grew 14% including an 11% increase for brand Coca-Cola. And we captured total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share in Mexico this past quarter, continuing a trend we have consistently seen in nearly every quarter over the last 4 years.  Brazil was up 2% for the quarter despite unseasonably cold and wet weather. Importantly, our business in Brazil continues to outperform the marketplace, marking the fifth consecutive quarter that Brazil has gained volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages. And our South Latin business, which includes Argentina and Chile, delivered high single-digit growth, capturing market share again in both sparkling and still beverages. Our Eurasia and Africa business grew 8% in the quarter, led by strong results in Russia, Turkey and India. Russia grew 27% this past quarter led by strong sparkling beverage growth. Brand Coca-Cola grew 24% in Russia, posting its fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.  Additionally, Fanta and Sprite also delivered strong double-digit growth in Russia this past quarter. And our business in Russia gained volume and value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, contributing more than 50% of nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage growth in Russia this past quarter. Turkey delivered 17% growth this quarter and gained sparkling beverage share led by trademark Coca-Cola, up a strong 19%.  India, meanwhile, once again delivered solid results growing 9%. This now marks the 19th consecutive quarter of positive growth for this tea market. India, also, once again delivered balanced growth across our entire portfolio, with sparkling beverages up 10% and still beverages up 9% this quarter. Moving now to Europe. Volume was up 1%, this region's third consecutive quarter of positive growth despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges. We also gained share in global nonalcoholic beverages as well as in both the sparkling and still beverage categories in Europe this quarter. Our sparkling beverages in Europe were up 1% for the quarter including trademark Coca-Cola also up 1%, and Coca-Cola Zero kept its strong momentum in Europe increasing double digits once again.  Our still beverages in Europe continued to grow and gain share across multiple categories including sports drinks, energy drinks and ready-to-drink tea. Germany delivered balanced 4% volume growth. This growth was balanced across our portfolio with sparkling beverages up 4% and still beverages up double digits, leading to total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share gains.  Finally our business in Northwest Europe keeps delivering solid results with positive growth in Great Britain, Sweden, Belgium and France. In fact, this marks France's 11th consecutive quarter of positive growth. Now let's return to a few of the global brands' success stories referenced at the start of today's call. Last quarter I shared how Fanta had become our third global brand to surpass $2 billion in annual unit case sales. Fanta is also our fourth global brand to surpass the $10 billion retail sales value threshold, joining Coca-Cola, Sprite and Diet Coca-Cola. Building on this momentum, we have extended Fanta's existing marketing efforts into a unified and global integrated campaign to reach consumers worldwide in regions representing 90% of Fanta's global sales volume. This highlights both our commitment to marketing productivity as well as our belief in investing behind our global brands.  I mentioned earlier that Del Valle recently became our 15th $1 billion brand. When we partnered with Coca-Cola Fanta to jointly acquire the Jugos del Valle business in 2007, the Del Valle brand was available in only 3 countries across Latin America with annual retail sales of under $500 million. Today, working in partnership with our entire Mexican bottling system, we have expanded Del Valle to 34 flavors and varieties in 15 countries making Del Valle the first of our $1 billion brands with its roots in our Latin America region. If we take a step back to reflect on this achievement, we can see that it is the latest example of how our global system can be so nimble and flexible as well as fast in achieving success. It is important to remember that our last 3 brands to achieve $1 billion status, Simply, Minute Maid Pulpy and Del Valle have all followed unique paths to success. Simply represents a classic case study, in fact, of how we organically built a new brand to complement our existing juice portfolio in order to take juices and juice drink category leadership in the United States.  Minute Maid Pulpy is a great example of how we've developed a unique brand experience, tailored to meet local taste in China and then leveraged our scale despite the success across multiple regions. And now, Del Valle stands as a prime illustration of how we can partner with our system to quickly achieve scale and address an area of opportunity in our beverage portfolio all across Latin America. The growth of these brands played a significant role in our company becoming the global leader in juices and juice drinks. Yet, we believe we have really just begun to tap our global potential in this key beverage category. As we advance our momentum around the world, we're also committed to building a better tomorrow. I've mentioned the work we're doing to support the rebuilding efforts in Japan, as it always has been part of our company's DNA to support communities in need. For example, this year is the 10th anniversary of the Coca-Cola Africa Foundation. This foundation focuses on transforming lives and empowering communities across the African continent. We are involved in programs focused on improving access to clean water, preventative health, education and entrepreneurship training among others. Over the past decade, the Coca-Cola Africa Foundation has implemented more than 160 community projects in nearly 40 countries investing more than $100 million across Africa. Looking ahead to the next decade, the foundation is committed to expanding its footprint and to implementing a project in every country on the continent. Another way we are building for a better tomorrow is by further advancing our sustainability efforts. In the past, we've talked about the advancement of our PlantBottle, a package that functions like a regular, fully recyclable plastic bottle but is made with plant-based materials resulting in a lighter footprint on the planet. Last month, we announced that all DASANI and Odwalla single-serve bottles in the United States would now be available in our PlantBottle. In fact, Odwalla's new packaging is entirely composed of materials derived from sugarcane, making our company the first to develop and enter the market with 100% plant-based, fully recyclable package.  And this past February at the CAGNY conference, we announced a special partnership with Heinz to expand the use of our PlantBottle in the United States. We are pleased to see this technology adapted by other companies, as we believe that innovative collaboration and an open exchange between companies is more important today than ever, especially as it relates to the environment. As we build for a better tomorrow, our efforts and performance are being recognized. This past quarter, we've been honored to receive several acknowledgments. Fortune Magazine ranked as #6 in their 2011 list of the World's Most Admired Companies, up from #10 in 2010. DiversityBusiness magazine placed us at #4 in their list of the top 50 organizations for multicultural business opportunities. And we received two Edison Awards, including a Silver Award in the Packaging category for our PlantBottle and a Gold Award in the New Retail Frontiers category for our Freestyle fountain drink dispenser.  While all of us at the Coca-Cola Company are proud of these achievements, we understand that they only represent a snapshot of where we are today rather than where we aspire to be tomorrow. It is our good fortune to steward an incredibly dynamic global commercial enterprise and a very special brand that will celebrate its 125th anniversary in just a couple of weeks on May 8. As we look towards the future, we do so against the backdrop of a global economy that is still rebalancing. So there is no question that we are all experiencing a complex global geopolitical climate. Yet, this complexity and the challenges they raise also bring real opportunities and exciting growth prospects.  In fact, since day one of our 2020 Vision's guiding principles has been that our system has only just begun to achieve its potential. As we look forward, the opportunities before us are clearly abundant, a billion people entering the middle class in the next decade, the corresponding political economic and social rise of the emergent world and an unparalleled expansion of cities, personal mobility, technology and education.  Today, we live in a paradoxical world of remarkable promise and great challenges. Yet, together with our bottling partners, we've been preparing for this world, aligning our system behind the strategies and priorities called in our 2020 Vision. This strong alignment has not only helped us navigate recent storms, it has put us in a position of real strength. The growing strength of our brands and our consistent operating and financial performance are proof positive of how we are steadily and strategically advancing our global momentum. That is why, as we look ahead to 2020 and beyond, we are confident that our system is well positioned to meet and exceed our long-term targets and to usher in a new era of winning for all of our shareholders. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Gary.\nGary Fayard: Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone.  As Muhtar shared, we're off to a good start this year, advancing our momentum with 6% worldwide volume growth and the delivery of another quarter of consistent quality growth in line with our expectations. We feel particularly good about these results since we delivered them while productively integrating our North America business and while navigating several unforeseen global events including the tragedy in Japan, the unrest in the Middle East and a volatile global commodity costs environment.  While, as expected, there are many puts and takes to consider in reviewing our quarterly results, and I'll go through all of those, I want to affirm that except for Japan, we do not see any of these puts and takes changing our full year bottom line expectations. In fact, this quarter's good results are a testament to our global system's ability to execute our strategic plans in keeping with our 2020 Vision and long-term growth targets.  So let me start by reviewing our earnings results for the quarter. As outlined in our release, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.86, up 7% versus the prior year and in line with our long-term growth targets. While this result came in $0.01 below consensus in many analyst models, it includes a $0.01 dilutive effect from the timing of marketing expenses as we are required to conform our newly acquired North American bottling business to the Coca-Cola Company's accounting policies.  Let me take a moment to explain what this accounting treatment means in plain English. As many of you know, we apply something we call a sales curve accounting policy to our marketing expenses, which means we recognize marketing on a pennies-per-case basis. So, basically, the same pennies-per-case of marketing for the full year as we spread the marketing across the year. For example, when we sponsor and activate an event like the recent NCAA March Madness basketball tournament, rather than recognizing the entire costs of the sponsorship in the quarter, we recognize the costs over the full year in line with our estimated volume along with all the other marketing.  Once our 2011 quarterly business plans were finalized in the first quarter of this year, we began to apply the same accounting policy to marketing expenses associated with our newly acquired North American business. The application of this sales curve accounting policy pulled incremental marketing expenses into the first quarter results, diluting our comparable first quarter 2011 earnings per share by $0.01. As we couldn't tell you about this accounting adjustment until we finalized our quarterly business plan spreads, we realize out that many of you do not have this accounting reflected in your model. As you consider how to model this adjustment going forward, please note that this sales curve dilution will reverse itself in the fourth quarter of this year. Our first quarter results also reflect the effect of the recent tragic events in Japan on our business. As Muhtar mentioned earlier, we finished the quarter in Japan up 1%. But prior to the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, our business was actually on track to deliver quarterly volume growth of 3% to 4%. Although it is impossible to precisely calculate what might have happened, our best estimate is that recent events in Japan had a $0.01 dilutive effect on our first quarter's comparable earnings per share due to lost revenues primarily related to shifts in product packaging and channel mix. Separately, we have identified a set of onetime items in Japan this quarter primarily related to bottler assistance and our $31 million Reconstruction Fund that totaled approximately $80 million dollars. These are duly reflected in our GAAP, non-GAAP tables and have no impact on our comparable results. Finally, our very early estimate of how events in Japan may further influence our full year results is that it could dilute the rest of our full year comparable earnings per share between $0.02 and $0.04. We expect the majority of this impact to fall in the third and fourth quarter. As Muhtar mentioned earlier, our Japan team is doing everything they can to restore our business in Japan. And going forward, I can assure you that we'll keep providing routine and all new on updates regarding our business in Japan. We also expect that many of you have questions regarding our updated currency and commodity outlook especially as both continue to move in today's volatile marketplace. Let me start with currencies.  Since our last earnings call in February, we've seen a higher benefit than expected from currency. Considering both our hedged positions and current spot rates, we now believe that currencies will have a low to mid-single-digit positive benefit on our operating income on a full year basis. But before you flow this currency benefit through to our bottom line, please note that since our last earnings call, we've also seen our total company commodity costs exposure for this year increase by approximately $250 million to $300 million, primarily driven by continued rise in the price of PET. While PET is not a commodity that can be hedged, we are actively pursuing and executing plans to mitigate and offset some of this increase, including the acceleration of several supply chain initiatives that would reduce our overall commodity exposure.  In addition, we are strategically leveraging our brand pack channel and pricing strategies where and when appropriate to further balance this exposure. For example, we recently announced our plans to raise prices on our refrigerated orange juice products in North America by 6% to 9% starting in April. As a result and based on our current and best estimates, we expect our ongoing pricing and supply chain efforts as well as our improved currency benefits to have offset almost all of the $250 million to $300 million increase in 2011 commodity costs exposure over the course of this year.  And please note that we are continuing to actively hedge our commodity and currency exposures. This past quarter, we had net unrealized gains of $36 million related to our hedging activities on commodities. Consistent with how we treated these gains in the fourth quarter of 2010, we elected to exclude the gains, which would have been a benefit of $0.01 per share to our comparable earnings results. For your reference, we have called out our net unrealized hedge gains in the notes to our GAAP and non-GAAP schedule and will continue to do so in our future earnings reports. Let me share one final note before we go in the details of our operating results. Now that we are integrating our North America business, it is operating as a single consolidated entity for financial reporting purposes. For example, pieces of our North America business, that used to operate in a concentrate model, are now operating as a finished goods model. In addition, we now have single sales teams that sell of our products across customer accounts in a way that is no longer comparable to how our brands were sold prior to the Coca-Cola Enterprises North America transaction.  Integrating and changing the way we run our North America business is a necessary step in order for us to release the synergies associated with this transaction. As a result, we are simply unable to separate out the results proportions of Coca-Cola Refreshments that used to be a part of CCE North America. This means that when reviewing our North America and total company results, there will be several financial statement line items and calculations that will look different to you this quarter than they have in the past and will continue to look different through the balance of this year until we fully cycle the effects of the CCE transaction. To best help you understand our business and performance this year, we'll keep providing you with comparable currency neutral results consistent with how we've always communicated our results. Having said that, we recognize that some line items are significantly altered due to the CCE transaction. In those cases, we'll supplement our financial results with additional commentary in order to always provide you with as complete a picture of our underlying business performance as possible. For the quarter, comparable operating income was up 10% including a 3% benefit from currency. Further, our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 40% benefiting from a 4% increase in concentrate sales, a 2% currency benefit, positive price mix and a significant increase due to our recent CCE transaction.  This quarter's price mix calculation is an example of a calculation that looks different this quarter as a direct result of the CCE transaction. We understand that price mix is a key metric for understanding our results. We, therefore, estimated that our first quarter retail pricing in North America was positive between 1% and 2%. We can also confirm that our combined international and Bottling Investment Group price mix was up 2% this quarter. So based on this, our total company price mix was positive this quarter in line with our full year guidance and consistent with our long-term growth targets. Looking at a few other line items, where those calculations where influenced this quarter by the CCE transaction, comparable currency neutral gross profit growth of 30%, comparable currency neutral cost of goods sold rise by 53% and comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses increased by 49%. To better understand this quarter's SG&A, it's helpful to look at our consolidated results in pieces.  First as you would expect, North America's SG&A is clearly higher due to our acquisition of CCE's North America business and the application of the sales curve accounting policy to our marketing expenses resulting in unfavorable operating expense leverage. This increase in SG&A will remain through the year until we fully cycle that acquisition.  Second, our Bottling Investment Group's SG&A was up 5% on a comparable currency neutral basis, excluding structural change such as Norway and Sweden. This is to be expected as we make strategic investments to further expand our production and sales capabilities in key growth markets in line with the guidance provided in our last call.  Third, our international operating segment's SG&A was slightly up this quarter due to an increase in our direct marketing expenses as we remain committed to investing in our brands for long-term growth. Taking these increases in SG&A in consideration and considering the dilutive effect recent events in Japan may have had on our full year gross profit, we now anticipate our company's operating expense leverage to be even for the full year. Similarly and not surprising, our gross margins for this quarter were also influenced by the inclusion of the CCE transaction that results as North America becomes a larger portion of our consolidated gross margins. It's important to note, however, that both our international operations and our Bottling Investments Group saw positive comparable currency neutral gross margin growth in the quarter after excluding structural items. Finally this quarter, our cash flow from operations was $458 million. Part of this is attributable to the inclusion of CCE's North America business in our results, as these operations have traditionally required increased levels of working capital in the first quarter. In addition, please note that this cash flow result is net of $769 million in contributions made to our pension plans as part of our previously announced 2011 contribution schedule. For the full year 2011, we plan to contribute about $800 million. So pretty much all of it already contributed in the quarter.  Now let me take a moment to update our view on a few other items related to our 2011 outlook. Our productivity initiatives are well on track and will deliver $500 million in annual savings by the end of this year as per our original plan. As for synergies related to the CCE transaction, we can reaffirm our commitment to capture between $140 million and $150 million of net cost synergies in 2011. With regard to our share repurchase program, we've been active in the marketplace and are well on track to achieve at least $2 billion and $2.5 billion in share repurchases over the course of the full year.  As for equity income, we recently sold our ownership stake in Embonor and, thus, will no longer recognize equity income from Embonor results. Looking forward, equity income will also be affected by the proposed merger between the Embotelladoras Arca and Grupo Continental in Mexico. If and when this deal is approved and completed, our ownership in the new company would be reduced so that we would no longer apply the equity method of accounting to the resulting entity. So our best estimate there, when you consider the sale of our ownership stake of Embonor as well as the expected change in accounting resulting from the proposed Arca-Continental merger, our company's equity income would decrease by approximately $0.01 on a full year basis. Finally with respect to our tax rate, our underlying effective rate stands at 24%, in line with the full year estimate range of between 23.5% and 24.5% provided in our last call.   In closing, we are greatly encouraged to see our business deliver another quarter of solid volume revenue and profit results. Our seasoned management team and our highly capable global bottling partners are clearly taking the right actions and executing the right strategies to advance our global momentum and drive our 2020 Vision. We remain confident that we'll keep winning in the marketplace, enhancing the health of our brands and driving long-term sustainable growth and value for our shareholders. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And, sir, our first question comes from Carlos LaBoy from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nCarlos LaBoy - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG: Can you shed some light on the drivers that sustain this momentum going into the second half? But I think if you could please direct a portion of your answer to the Bottler Investment Group [Bottling Investment Group] performance I think specifically, we'd like to hear if you can expand on China? How important is Pulpy to the relative mix there now as it continues to grow? In India, what drivers sustain the growth in the second half? And in the Philippines, you always seem to use these macro downturns or these economic periods of difficulty to reset the business in your favor. How do you modify the Philippine plan to win in this inflationary environment?\nMuhtar Kent: This is Muhtar. Let me just start. I think what you saw in the first quarter global -- huge global geopolitical challenges, natural disasters. And I'm very pleased, I can say, that we have delivered consistent quality growth across all 5 of the geographic operating groups. That gives me confidence about going into the year. We're winning with our global sparkling beverage portfolio. Brand Coke, again, grew an impressive 3% in the quarter, in addition, Fanta, which is our fourth global brand, passing the $10 billion retail value. So with growth in all 5 geographic operating groups, excluding our cross-licensed brands of 6% internationally, and if you look at -- it's important to look at what we're cycling each quarter. We are consistently delivering volume growth in line with our long-term targets or above. And what you see from an international perspective is Q1 of 2010, we're cycling 5%. So we're actually increasing the momentum. Last quarter of 2010, Q4 was 5% international. We're, again, accelerating that growth in the midst of huge economic, political and natural challenges. So I think that gives us confidence as we go into the year. And, again, when you look at our U.S. business delivering again the fourth consecutive quarter, we're investing. As we do this, our brands are now getting healthier. Our share results, market share and value share, volume and value share results in this past quarter are the best we've seen in a long time. And in fact, we have a chart that shows by category, by region, share. Except for 1 metric on that chart, everything is green this past quarter, which we haven't seen it like that for a very long time. So again, India and China, you've referenced, I think, China as we -- Q1 sparkling gained volume share. Q1 still gained volume and value share, and sparkling beverage share, as I mentioned in the call in my remarks, is now at the highest level we've seen in over 2 years. And we're making some proactive changes to our packaging architecture in China. Our bottlers are investing. When you look at the investment plan that we announced back in 2009, we are ahead of that with $2 billion from '09, '10 'and '11. The 3 plants that we opened last year have all come -- are all contributing to being a part of the communities that they serve. And that India, again, we took a sizable price increase in Q1 and held with it in Q1 in 2011 and chose to maintain it in the face of aggressive discounting from various factions. And again, we delivered very impressive results with brand Coke growing, Sprite growing, thumbs up we're growing in a very healthy manner as well as our still portfolio led by Maaza growing. So, overall, that gives me confidence when I see our brands. And just last point in China, Pulpy was up, again, almost 30%, and then you asked about the Philippines. I think Philippines post-elections have been a very challenging environment after the heat -- the economy was heated artificially pre-elections, and what we're doing is making sure that our business stays healthy. We invest in our brands in the Philippines. Our brand metrics are getting stronger in the Philippines. And Philippines in this quarter was down in volume, but we believe that we are doing the right things in the Philippines to win in the long term. And as far as the Bottling Investment Group is concerned, if you actually take out the structural elements related to Sweden, Norway and so forth, actually it was up 3%, just similar to the same period prior year. So we're happy with the healthy performance also of BIG. Germany, as you can see, is beginning to look like really a turnaround story, again, another quarter of healthy growth and gaining share in Germany against all the challenges that we have with the marketplace there in Germany as it relates to discounts or so. We are winning, again, in all channels in Germany now, and it's beginning to look like a very positive story. So that's what I would like to sort of frame up. I don't know if I missed anything, but that's how I frame your question, Carlos.\nCarlos LaBoy - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I wanted to probe a little bit more. If we could ask for more visibility on what is going on with Germany. That 4% number is a good number. Can you talk about 2 things, Muhtar? #1, what you think is driving that, the role of spending in that? And then #2 as we think about your gross margin outlook for Germany, you've got, potentially, the benefit of some volume leverage, potentially, the benefit of mix. Potentially, some positives there in the GM side. But, of course, commodities are a challenge. So how are you thinking about the gross margin outlook for Germany as well at the bottling level.\nMuhtar Kent: I think first as you see, all restructuring that we've been involved in for the past 36 months in Germany is beginning to pay out as volume grows in that restructured and more productive infrastructure that we have both in terms of production, as well as distribution, as well as warehousing in Germany. And then with strong brands, when you look at brand Coke, again, in Germany, which was actually up 4% supported by very strong marketing, and then some other brands, Sprite, a very healthy growth, up almost 7%, very good brand portfolio metrics in Germany. And, also, still beverages doing very well like Nestea in Germany. So, overall, I would say that gross margins, we don't give forward-looking outlook. But I'd to say that we're pleased with the improvements we're seeing across our margins in Germany, particularly as the benefits of the restructuring are beginning to come alive, as the volume is beginning to pick up in multiple channels in Germany. And then also, I'd like to stress all the work that is being done by our Bottling Investments Group under the leadership of Damian in Germany is also beginning to show in the immediate consumption transactions in Germany.\nGary Fayard: Mark, it's Gary. One other thing to recognize as well is that when you referenced commodity costs versus Germany, remember that all of those -- most of all of those commodities are priced in dollars. And I was talking about in the prepared remarks, there is an inter-relationship to a large extent between commodities and currency. And so in Germany, with the strength of the euro, is offsetting some of the costs of commodities as well. So you get different views on commodity costs if you look at different countries.\nMuhtar Kent: And one last thing, Mark, please note that this is the highest absolute unit case volume sales in Germany we've seen in a decade. And the way the bottling business works if you look at this restructured, more productive, leaner system that we have in place after the hard work of the last 36 months and as you sort of model increase in volume, that translates into better margins.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Helpful stuff. If I could make one follow-up there. Muhtar, the role of package mix in the bottling operations, you mentioned immediate consumption. But how impactful, how beneficial is package mix affecting the bottling ops there.\nMuhtar Kent: Are you talking about Germany or...\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Germany specifically, yes.\nMuhtar Kent: I think the only way that we have begun to win with discounters is through a very decisive and very novel and innovative packaging strategy. So you've seen us employ a very innovative packaging strategy in order to be able to be represented with all our brands and also the discounted channels.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Pecoriello, Consumer Edge Research.\nWilliam Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: Gary, thanks on the detailed explanation from the puts and takes on the quarter. A couple of other points I just wanted to clarify. With the 7% operating profit growth in the quarter, currency neutral, you mentioned the commodity hedged timing, the market spend timing, we also have the Easter shift and 1 less shipping day. So trying to best understand your underlying operating profit growth, do you view it as high single digits when you account for those other puts and takes?\nGary Fayard: Yes, Bill. In fact, this is one of the difficulties as you know, it's -- let's say -- 1 less shipping day, the Easter shift, et cetera. You're now into estimates of what might it have been and those kinds of things, which is why I did not try to actually quantify those. But there are couple of things we know we can quantify. If you put the impact -- if our best estimate is that the impact of Japan is $0.01. The impact of the sales curve on CCR in North America is $0.01 and that wouldn't just reverse this Q1 in Q4. But if you just put those things together, right there, that's 2 to 3 points on OI growth, just those 2 things. And then the hedges that we took, the commodity hedge gains, that's another $36 million, another $0.01. We took those out. Those will go back in kind of primarily third quarter-ish timing. But that's another 1.5 points of growth on OI. So that's why we feel comfortable. I mean, it's a dynamic world out there. But we feel comfortable with all the puts and takes. There's some real bad things like the tragedy in Japan. There's some good things where we've made some decisions to change accounting policies, and it's a Q1, Q4 quarterly thing. It doesn't impact the year at all, but we just think it's the right way to go.\nMuhtar Kent: And one other thing to add, Bill, also, you have to see that we are continuing to aggressively invest in our brands. And that is something, so in the quarter you will see -- you will have seen continued growth in direct marketing and marketing expenses. And again, that is something that we are very adamant to continue despite all the different challenges of commodities and other things that are happening around the world.\nWilliam Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: Great. And, Gary, on the Easter shift, the reason it's also more complicated now into the timing shift but now with the accounting of CCE, the concentrate was booked in the Q1 last year and now shifted into Q2 this year. It's booked along with the bottler case sales. So that was also a complication, how to model the timing on that, correct?\nGary Fayard: You're exactly right. And, in fact, Bill, I was sitting with some of my finance people yesterday and we were going through exactly that and going through what do we think the impact of the Easter shift was because we're actually starting to focus, as you might imagine, on quarter 2. And then we got into, Okay, so what does this shift in July 4 do? And what days do they fall in the week? If it turns out July 4 is a Monday, if you look. And so that's part of as we're kind of looking. But you do have -- you're actually right. You' have both impacts. You got the calendar impact. And then because of the acquisition, you've got the impact of when the revenue is actually recognized in the financial statements.\nWilliam Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Faucher from JP Morgan.\nJohn Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co: So I wanted to follow up a little bit on the North America price mix commentary, which you guys said, I guess in the call, you said 1% to 2%. Can you talk a little bit about mix and how we should view mix now that the gap between full revenue cases and concentrate cases is different? I assume we're just going to see significantly less full revenue case mix, et cetera. And then as we look at the scanner data that we get, the pricing doesn't sort of flow with that. So can you talk a little bit about the price pack architecture and sort of how we should look at changes sort of package versus package versus different packages coming through and also some of the channel differentials right now?\nMuhtar Kent: John, I think, first what I would like to state is that in North America, particularly in the U.S., sparkling IC transactions, again, grew this past quarter. That's the second quarter in a row. And prior to this, you'd need to note that transactions had declined every quarter dating back all the way to 2007. So that's something that, again, we're focusing on very heavily to continue to drive transaction. So, I think, in regards to transactions overall, we grew IC package volume a good 2%, which would translate to overall transaction growth for the portfolio. So that is very positive and that somewhat compensates also for the price of the increases that had been referenced as 1% to 2% in the last call. What I'd like to, also, frame for the remainder of the year, though, is that we will be looking at every opportunity, every opportunity in North America to see if we can generate a higher price than the overall 1% to 2% and more like, maybe, 3% to 4%, as we look into the balance of the year. And we believe that our brand strength will allow us to generate a higher price increase than the 1% to 2%. And, at the same time, we will be diligently, again, putting all our efforts to grow IC transactions in the United States. And recognizing that higher price increase may have some volume impact, but driving transactions will be the key in North America. And I don't know if Gary would like to add to your other question that is related to the revenue realization given that the business is now operating as one integrated business. One other thing I'd like to add is that, again, the 16-ounce package was up double digits again in the quarter, which is giving us, again, goods metrics for the future.\nGary Fayard: John, Gary. Just a couple of things on North America that I want to focus on and reemphasize one thing that Muhtar just said as well. When we look at it, we took different pricing percentages on different packages and different channels, obviously, as you would expect in North America. But the weighted average of all of that is in the 1% to 2% range. That's announced. That's in the market, and we're getting that. So we have to kind of look at the scanner data that you're referring to because a lot of -- remember that Nielsen and ROI only covers about, I think, about 40% of the U.S., our U.S. market, that there's so much that, that's not in Nielsen and ROI. So that's the large part out of it. But then, as Muhtar says, we're going to look at additional pricing this year in the U.S. as well. Now with that said, I want to emphasize something else he was talking about, which is on driving, on transactions. And we've all talked volume for years and years, but transactions is really about creating health for the brand, wealth and really drives sustainable long-term value, we think, for the brand. And you saw us downsize packages in North America going to the 14- and 16-ounce and the reason to do that was to drive transactions and recruit and rerecruit users of our brands. You will see us doing the same kinds of things of downsizing in other countries as well. So that is going to have an impact on volume results, But, if you will, help drive transactions and could be an implicit kind of price increase as well, where you downsize a package but hold the price and can get pricing as well. And you'll see us doing that in different markets around the world as we talked about it. So, all in all, I think you're seeing some actions that we're taking that we think will prove good long term for the health of brands as well as build value for the company as well.\nJohn Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Great, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.\nCaroline Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: I wonder if you could address 2 things. I mean in order to cover the commodity costs pressures, I'm assuming there, you mainly feel them in North America and in the Bottling Group. How much pricing would be required to fully offset that, if you did not have anything else to work with in terms of cost cuts? And then I'm just wondering if you could tell us a little bit more about how things are operating in Japan and where the earnings drag might be? Is it a mix shift? Is it that you need to give away product? Is it the cost of doing business? Just a little more insight into Japan.\nMuhtar Kent: As far as commodity, Gary signaled some levels of commodities, the updates in terms of the additional commodity pressures that are coming into our business. Yes, you were right in saying and looking at the fact that, as far as commodities impact for our business is concerned, it's mainly North America and BIG. But we look at this holistically across the world from a system point of view, and there's some hedges in place. There puts and takes. So it's not just a simple equation, here's the number and how much price increase would you need. All we can signal is that as, obviously, you mentioned -- you heard me talk about -- I mean it's consumption, this is growing. That is a big benefit, when you have -- because those packages have a higher margin. They have a higher price. And as the mix shifts in favor of immediate consumption, then, obviously, we get the benefit and a windfall, and we don't have to go out and take pricing across all categories, all channel. That's the way we kind of think about our business. You heard me, again, in my comments talk about the new packages coming on stream in China. You see us doing the same thing in the Philippines, across the whole world, Germany many new packages. So I think we're employing a much more flexible, fast, nimble brand-priced pack channel architecture that is designed to ensure that we don't have to take across-the-board pricing. And that's why this business of ours actually performs so well across the world in such troubling macroeconomic -- in such a troubling microeconomic environment. And also by the way, if there isn't going to be an inflationary period coming, that will benefit us overall as a business, as a system, as a structure, as a category. So I think all of that bodes well for how we look at the future. I think the other part of the question was related to Japan. And I'd like to just stay in Japan, that I said that all the plants that are in the impacted area, 8 plants are back up and running. Really if you're talking about somewhat of a shift in channels, I think the vending channel, obviously, because a lot of factories were not able to operate fully in Japan. So there is a shift in channel, there is a shift in the business. That's going to have some impact. And then, overall, I think supply chain is still stressed in Japan in terms of being able to supply the market, in terms of being able to empty out the warehouses, in terms of being able to distribute effectively. All of that will be part of the numbers that Gary mentioned as far as the full year impact in Japan is concerned. However, let me just stress this. Just prior to the earthquake, our business was up 4% in the quarter in Japan until the earthquake hit. So we were having very good positive momentum on top of a good year last year with our brands, with our portfolio, all 4 cylinders of our Japan business firing well. And therefore, one fundamental of the business is really the brand health. And given -- and our bottlers are investing again and are very eager and have done fantastic work in normalizing the business in Japan. So, overall, I think Gary mentioned the sort of scope of what may be the impact, and we'll try to mitigate everything we can. And I think Gary just wants to add something to that.\nGary Fayard: Caroline, I would just add a couple of things and just a little more detail to what Muhtar has told you. All the plants are back up and running. But we've got -- the bottlers have a lot of large automated warehouses, and those are not all back up and running. And so we still have supply chain issues in the country. Additionally, not only do you have channel mix issues as Muhtar referenced, you've got in shifts in product mix as well. But probably and most importantly, and this is where you will see a lot of the impact come through as well, what would normally be happening today is that the bottlers would be just running plants full bore, kind of building finished stock inventory for the summer selling season. We're not able to do that. And so what's going to happen is beginning about third quarter, and this is why I was referencing the impact of really the third and fourth quarter, is that we're not going to be able to supply all the demands, as we believe, because we're not going to be able to manage and build up inventory stocks ahead of time as you normally would in a normal year. So that's -- well, we think we saw an impact in the first quarter that will probably rebound a little bit in the second quarter just around concentrate shipments, and then it's going to reverse back in the third and fourth quarter is kind of what we think is going to happen.\nCaroline Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: Thank you so much.\nMuhtar Kent: And we'll keep updating you as we go along, Caroline.\nCaroline Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: That's really helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley: So I have just 1 point of clarification, Gary. The pricing environment potentially improving in North America in the balance of the year, is that more in the sparkling side of the portfolio or more in the still side? And I assume the more robust expectation is due more to less price increases as opposed to mix, is that correct?\nGary Fayard: Well, couple of things I would say it's going to be -- it would be balanced and if we took you through our pricing architecture in North America. It's actually not -- it's actually pretty complicated. I was going to say not as simple as you would think it would be because you, basically, got different pricing on different packages, on different brands by channel, and so you're going -- you've got different elasticities of demand by package. So you're going to implement different pricing for those different SKUs at about by channel. But we are expecting to see, we have talked about 1% to 2% pricing in North America. We're now saying that we're going to probably be going for more pricing than that this year, and a lot of that is just strictly the environment that we're in. So that's the way we would see it right now.\nDara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley: That's helpful. Just taking a step back and looking in North American margins longer-term, obviously, this year they'll be hurt by the bottler consolidation and some of the commodity inflation.\nGary Fayard: Yes.\nDara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley: But I was hoping you could highlight for us conceptually the longer-term opportunity you have beyond 2011 in terms of expanding your North American margins given they're still below some of your other regions and what are the key drivers of that would be.\nMuhtar Kent: The key of the drivers are going to be IC pushing really making sure that we win every transaction, growing transactions, growing the immediate consumption channel. There's so much work to be done, still opportunities to be had in the immediate consumption channel in the independent stores, in merchandising, in making our products much more desired and making and creating inspiration at the point of sale in those IC channel, just like what, in a way, you saw us do in Philadelphia, and I think CCR and their state of leadership has got the right organization. We've got the right investments in place. And then we have our brands are healthy. That all that translate, if we execute well, which we intend to do, then you will see us expanding margins as IC business grows and as our smaller packs take more attraction inside the 4 walls of our every single customer which we serve.\nDara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley: Thanks so much. And, Gary, just 1 last clarification. Did North American profit come in line with your own internal expectations in the quarter?\nGary Fayard: Yes. In fact, they came in slightly ahead of our internal expectations.\nDara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley: Thanks.\nMuhtar Kent: Good. Thank you. In closing, I'd like to thank many of you who attended our recent presentation at both CAGNY and CAGE conferences this past few months.

Please look on our website for this information. Now, let me turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Jackson and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying that we are pleased with our reported results today. In a year marked by further uncertainty in the global economy, once again, we delivered solid volume, solid revenue and solid profit growth. We grew our worldwide volume by 3% in the quarter and 4% for the full year. We generated, in comparable currency neutral, net revenue growth of 5% in the quarter and 6% for the full year in the process delivering net revenues over $48 billion in 2012, consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter, we delivered full year comparable currency neutral operating income growth of 6%. This growth also translated into our company-generating record comparable operating income of more than $11 billion for 2012. Importantly, we met our long-term volume revenue and profit targets for the full year, an accomplishment we are proud of meeting or exceeding every year since we announced our 2020 Vision. In fact, since the first quarter of 2010, and the start of our 2020 Vision, during one of the most difficult macroeconomic environments in recent history, we have firstly grown our daily servings by more than $200 million serving more consumers daily on a global basis than at any other time in our history. Secondly, increased our global volume and value share of both, our Spark or our core sparkling and nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages to their highest levels since 2003, and thirdly we added over $30 billion to our company's market capitalization. We are well on our way to doubling our systems' revenues by 2020 to $200 billion, reflecting the ongoing commitment of our entire global system to keep investing together for a better tomorrow, and we are crystal-clear on why we do what we do, so it is our mission to refresh the world, inspire moments of optimism and happiness and to create sustainable value while making a lasting difference. This year, we once again led industry growth and expanded our volume and value share gains globally in nonalcoholic, ready-to-drink beverages. We gained global share in the sparkling beverage category, where our portfolio was up 3% for the full year. This is the third straight year our sparkling beverages had grown by at least 550 million incremental cases. This has added more than 13 billion new servings annually to our global business for the past three. This growth of our sparkling beverages has consistently and reliably been led by brand Coca-Cola, which grew a very healthy 3% for the full year of 2012. We also gained global share in still beverages with our portfolio growing a solid 10% for the full year. This year, this full year growth was led by POWERADE and DASANI, which were both up double digits and our Glaceau trademark brands, which were up mid-single digits. In fact, our still beverage portfolio growth was well-balanced with mid-single to double-digit growth across every single still beverage category in which we compete. As we have shared for some time now, we recognize that consumers across the globe continue to feel the effects of a still uncertain global economy. 2012 saw the extension of prolonged uncertainty in Europe, the ongoing transition of the economy in China [one] recovery in the United States and ongoing challenges for Japanese consumers. We expect this volatility to extend through 2013. Having said, the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage category on the whole continues to be vibrant and grow in line with the levels we forecasted when we first developed our 2020 Vision. Our experience also teaches us that it is critical to seize opportunities during these uncertain times in order to lead and to succeed in any macro environment. To do so, we will together with our bottling partners keep investing in our business, so that we not only grow bigger, but also we grow better, better at collaborating, better at innovating and better at listening to our consumers and customers as well as bottling partners. And most importantly, better at executing with precision. So, while 2013 will once again be a year of challenges, we are confident that we will continue to generate consistent quality growth in this, the fourth year, of our 2020 Vision. So now, let us review our performance results across our global markets in more detail beginning first with North America flagship market. Our business in North America delivered its 11th consecutive quarter of growth, up 1% for the quarter and 2% for the full year. As a result, our North America business achieved its best ever full-year volume sales results. In addition, we sustained 2% positive price mix in 2012, resulting in our North America beverage business generating 6% full-year comparable currency neutral net revenue growth. Importantly, we achieved this growth while also realizing full-year volume and value share gains in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. In fact, since we initiated our 2020 Vision back at the end of 2009, our U.S. business has seen consumer dollar spent across measured channels increase from approximately $56 to $60 per person in 2012. This represents over $1.5 billion of value created by our brand portfolio in these measured channels alone. I am personally very pleased with our ability to deliver quality results, as well as to consistently create real value across our entire North America business. This year's growth in North America was led by our still beverage portfolio which was up 8% in both the quarter and also for the full year. This is the fifth consecutive year that our North America still beverage portfolio has either maintained or gained, both volume and value share. Our POWERADE brand grew double digits in both the quarter and for the full year making this POWERADE's third consecutive year of double-digit growth. More importantly, POWERADE is the North America sports drink category in both absolute volume and value growth for full year 2012. This was further evidenced of how today's consumers are increasingly demonstrating a growing preference for this innovative sports drinks brand. Our premium Smartwater brand achieved a fifth straight year of double-digit growth. Our juice and juice drinks portfolio also delivered a year of positive growth with our Simply trademark up 7% on a full-year basis. As such our total juice and juice drinks portfolio gained volume and value share in both the quarter and full-year. Finally, our tea portfolio in North America sustained its momentum, up double digits while gaining volume and value share in both the quarter and full year. This result was led by Gold Peak which was up 36% in 2012 cycling 48%, making this Gold Peak's sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. Our sparkling beverage business in North America delivered absolute value growth in 2012 with full year in volume down 1% offset by a positive 2% price mix. Importantly, our strategy to provide meaningful and purposeful choice to consumers continued to yield benefits. Our core sparkling beverage immediate consumption transactions were up 1% for the full year enabling us to capture sparkling beverage volume and value share in North America in both the quarter and for the full year. Coke Zero sustained its momentum, up high single digits for the full year. We also saw accelerated growth in Fanta, which was up mid-single digits for the full-year. As we look ahead, we remain positive that North America is the long-term growth market for our sparkling beverage business. We will keep investing in the category and in our winning sparkling portfolio and continue to promote active, healthy well-being in all the communities that we proudly serve. Moving now to Latin America, our volume grew 5% in the quarter and for the full year. The incremental volume we generated in Latin America this year was equivalent to adding a business the size of Canada to this region's volume base. Our total business in Latin America set a new record with volume sales exceeding 8 billion unit cases or the equivalent of 192 billion servings on a full-year basis for the first time in our company's history. Our sparkling beverages in Latin America grew a healthy 3% in 2012 with brand Coca-Cola also up 3% both for the quarter and for the full year. Also our still beverages in Latin America delivered double-digit growth in both the quarter and for the full year. These well-balanced results translated into Latin America capturing volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages for the eighth consecutive year. We also saw balanced result across all four of our Latin American business units, each generating mid to high single-digit growth for the full year. Our two largest markets in Latin America, Mexico and Brazil, were both up a solid 5% this quarter, while also growing volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. On a full-year basis Mexico was up 4% supported by consistent brand Coca-Cola growth, up 8% in the quarter and the full year. Brazil grew 6% for the full year with sparkling beverages up mid-single digits in both, the quarter and the full year. And last December, also three of our bottling partners in Brazil, including two operated by our Bottling Investments Group, signed an agreement to combine their operations. When completed, this transaction is going to you create the second-largest Coca-Cola bottling operations in Brazil. The proposed combination with former company with a greater ability to invest in the market and accelerate growth, reflecting our franchise systems' continued evolution in our system's commitment to long-term sustainable growth in Brazil. Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which grew 2% in the quarter and 5% for the full year. In Japan, our full year volume grew 2% in line with the outlook we provided in our previous earnings calls. This resulted in our business in Japan delivering a third consecutive year of record high sales volumes. Our business in Japan also gained full year share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. This result was driven by volume growth across most channels, including drugstores, convenience retail outlet and supermarkets. I am also proud to announce that Ayataka, our premium green tea brands as well as LOHAS, our innovative water brand achieved $1 billion brand status in late 2012. These are the fourth and fifth billion dollar brands we have added to our portfolio since announcing our 2020 Vision. Also, with regard to Japan, last December the four Japanese bottlers from the Greater Kanto region announced an agreement to merge into one integrated and publicly listed company called Coca-Cola East Japan. While this agreement is still pending final approval by each of the four bottlers shareholders, once compete, Coca-Cola East Japan will become our fifth largest global bottling partners in terms of annual revenue. We support this bottler led consolidation in Japan, and see it as one example of net of the many ways our franchise system continues to evolve in full alignment with our 2020 Vision. Moving now to China, during our last earnings call we shared our clear expectations that China's ongoing economic transition will have a short-term impact on our industry and on our business. Since then we've seen disposable consumer spending remain quite challenged in China, especially in the export-driven coastal areas where higher proportion of our beverages are proceeding. As a result, our China volume was down 4% in the fourth quarter, also impacted by unseasonably poor weather, the cycling of double-digit growth from last year and the timing of the Chinese New Year. On a full-year basis, our volume in China grew mid-single digits, cycling double-digit growth from last year. Our strong sparkling beverage portfolio in China continued to expand our nearly 2 to 1 share advantage over our time ridge international competitor. This portfolio is very well-positioned in China with leading brands in every major sparkling flavor categories, including Sprite number one sparkling brand in China, Coca-Cola recently rated by Chinese consumers as their most favorite brand and Fanta, which registered double-digit growth in 2012 exceeding 100 million annual unit cases for the first half. And, we are committed to investing and innovating across our broader still beverage portfolio in China to strengthen our presence across all categories. As we look ahead to 2013, we still expect the ongoing uncertainty in China to have a short-term impact on our industry and on our business, although we do expect to see improvements in consumer disposable income as the year progresses. As such from here on, we expect our business to deliver sequential improvement in 2013. As we had stated before, we have every confidence in the long-term resilience of our China business and we remain very excited about our long-term opportunities in distribution. Across the rest of the Pacific Group, we realized several new milestone performances in fast-growing markets. South Korea was up double digits in 2012 with our business sales achieving over 200 million annual unit cases for the first half. Thailand, also delivered double-digit growth, up 22% for the full year resulting in record value share and full year unit case volume results. Philippines also achieved strong results, growing 5% for the full year while also capturing volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. As many of you know, we recently sold 51% of our bottling business in the Philippines to Coca-Cola FEMSA. While every bottling transaction is unique, this transaction is yet another example of our long-standing and fundamental belief in the strength of our global franchise system. We look forward to this new partnership with Coca-Cola FEMSA as we jointly invest and further strengthen our business in the Philippines to create sustainable, long-term growth and value. Our Eurasia and Africa business also extended its strong momentum, growing a very solid 10% in the quarter and up 11% for the full year including full year double-digit growth for brand Coca-Cola. During both the quarter and the full year, our business in Eurasia and Africa grew both volume and value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. On a country level, Russia was one of the key drivers of this group's performance up 8% in 2012 led once again by outstanding growth of brand Coca-Cola, which grew 20% for the full year. The momentum behind our Dobriy juice brand accelerated further with 13% growth for the full year. Viewed in total, we have outpaced the nonalcoholic ready-to drink-industry in Russia grew for three consecutive quarters. As a result, our business in Russia now has achieved an all-time high market share. Our business in India, which grew 16% on a full-year basis, continued its long stretch of strong growth realizing both volume and value share gains across both sparkling and still beverage. Importantly, India has now delivered six consecutive years of double-digit volume growth starting back in 2007. Moving now to Europe. Our business was down 5% in the quarter and was down 1% for the full year reflecting the region's ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. While we recognize the real challenges of today's European environment, it is important place our results in the proper context and to recognize the resiliency of our industry and our business in Europe. Since the start of 2009, when austerity measures, unemployment and fiscal concerns began to weigh heavily European consumer confidence, Europe has seen a GDP decline. In contrast during the same four year period, our business in Europe has outpaced the broader industry making our company one of a select few able to deliver positive growth between 2009 and 2012. We successfully grew our business in Germany up 1% in 2012, despite cycling 6% growth in 2011, while gaining full year share in nonalcoholic beverages. This makes it three consecutive years that Germany has deliver full year volume growth. As such we remain confident that our business in Germany is in a sound position and capable of delivering long-term sustainable growth. Looking ahead, we expect Europe's economic uncertainty to extend well into 2013. At the same time, we expect that the European economy and consumer sentiment will gradually improve that our business is well-positioned to return to volume growth as that occurs. We are also confident that our leadership team and our system will keep investing to outperform the industry in 2013 as Europe continues along the road to recovery. Before concluding my prepared remarks, I would like to highlight our company's sustained efforts and result to work to find meaningful solutions to the conflict issue of obesity. There is an important conversation going on about obesity and we want to be part of the solution. Together with partners in government, civil society, our own industry and other business, I am personally committed to leveraging all our resources to lead and make a difference here. We are committed to use evidence-based science to guide the choices we offer. We are committed to investing in innovation of our sweeteners, products, packaging and equipment that fosters active, healthy living. We are committed to bringing real choice to consumers everywhere and educating them on how the choices we offer can play a role in a sensible balanced diet and active, healthy lifestyles. We are committed to transparency about the nutritional content of our products and we are committed to responsible marketing of our products. In closing, we are pleased that our business has done so well in recent years and that we remain well on track to achieve our 2020 Vision. Together, we as a system have delivered on our priorities and we are achieving real success. With passionate commitment and our collective focus, we are propelling ourselves forward during these challenging economic and social times. As we look back to January 2010, we began our 2020 Vision, we had reasons to be proud of our collective achievement and yet remain constructively discontent. We completed new largest transaction in our history leading to the formation of Coca-Cola Refreshments in North America. We added five new $1 billion brand our portfolio. We maintained Coca-Cola as the world's most valuable brand and distinction is earned from very Interbrand every year since 2000, and we launched multiple programs to support the global communities we serve such as our 5x20 initiative to empower 5 million women by 2020 and provide entrepreneurial training to help growth the local businesses. All that said, we are keenly aware of how today's turbulent economic landscape is likely to extend through this year. As such, our 2013 strategic priorities remain absolutely clear. First will continue to grow sustainably and provide meaningful solutions that enhance the health and well-being of the community we proudly serve. Second, we will win with Coca-Cola while actively promoting the brand and the category. Third, we must absolutely keep winning and executing with excellence with point-of-sale. Fourth, we need to keep maximizing the value of our global beverage portfolio. And sixth, we will encourage and inspire our system and associates to deliver our mission and our vision. So, there is still a great runway ahead of us both, for our sparkling beverages as well as across the entire range of our broader portfolio. After all, global consumer expenditures are expected to grow strongly between 2013 and 2012, driven by further economic growth in developing emerging countries as well as expected middle class expansion in populous economies. So, while we are proud of our strong record of delivering results through the first three years of our 2020 Vision, we know that we are really just getting started. All of us at the Coca-Cola Company and the Coca-Cola System remain diligent about what we need to do in order to achieve our results and to effectively and efficiently manage our business for sustainable long-term success for all our stakeholders. With that let me now turn the call over to Gary.\nGary Fayard: Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to have once again delivered quality performance results in 2012, making this seventh straight year that our volume and operating income results have been in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets. Achieving such consistent performance during a time of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty is a real testament to our global systems' ability to execute our strategic priorities and alignment with our 2020 Vision. Therefore, we remain confident that we will continue to deliver full year volume, revenue and operating income results in line with our long-term growth targets. So let's review our results in more detail starting with our comparable earnings per share which came in at $0.45 this quarter, up 15% versus the prior year. Our full year comparable earnings per share came in at $2.01, up 5% despite facing what we estimate was about a 4% currency headwind for the full year. Our comparable currency neutral net revenues grew 5% in the quarter. The currency impact on this quarter's comparable net revenue results was a 1% headwind. Our full year comparable currency neutral net revenue growth was up 6% in line with our long-term growth target. On a comparable basis, the impact of currency on our full-year net revenue results was a 3% headwind. Our comparable currency neutral operating income was up double digits this quarter consistent with the outlook that we shared in our earnings call last quarter. As Muhtar shared a few moments ago, on a full-year basis our comparable currency neutral operating income came in at 6% as expected and in line with our long-term growth target. During our last few earnings call we shared a more specific full year 2012 outlook across several financial items to help those of you who model our business. I am pleased to say the results were right in line with or slightly ahead of the outlook that we provided. So I want to take a moment to recap these results and where applicable provide more and further insight into our full year 2013 outlook. With regard to volume growth, our full year 2012 concentrate sales growth was in line with our full year unit case volume growth as per our comments last quarter. Our consolidated price mix was up 1% for the full year 2012 consistent with our prior year full year outlook. For 2013, we expect to keep earning low single-digit consolidated price mix as called for on our long-term growth model as we continue executing our occasion-based brand, price, package and channel strategies with precision around the world. Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were up 5% on a full-year basis. This increase in SG&A reflects our ongoing commitment to keep investing for a better tomorrow as we grew our direct marketing expenses in 2012, while simultaneously capturing incremental marketing efficiencies. We also added additional feet on the street, primarily in North America, to ensure support of our growing business in this important market. Our SG&A results for the quarter and full year also included a benefit from the reversal of certain expenses related to our long-term incentive plans as well as a one point unfavorable impact of structural items primarily in our Bottling Investments Group and in North America. Our full year comparable gross margin was roughly in line with the estimate we provided during our previous earnings calls. Our operating expense leverage was a positive nine points this quarter as we benefited from having two additional selling days. The full year operating expense leverage came in at a positive one point. For 2013, we expect our positive operating expense leverage to be even to slightly positive as we sustain our strategic investments in brand building activities around the world and efficiently manage our operating expenses. As you as you model our 2013 operating results and our corresponding operating expense leverage, let me also remind everyone that our 2013 calendar will have one less day when compared to 2012, specifically our first quarter 2013 will have two less days when compared to the first quarter of 2012, then the fourth quarter of 2013 will have one more day when compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. Moving now to net interest which came in at a positive $31 million in the fourth quarter. This was ahead of our initial expectations and raised our full-year net interest income to $74 million. For 2013 our best estimate is that net interest will come in as an expense ranging between $30 million and $50 million for the full year of 2013. We will update this outlook each quarter as we move through the year. For 2012, underlying effective tax rate held steady at 24% and we expect the tax rate for 2013 to be approximately the same. Our cash flow from operations increased 12% on the full year 2012 partially benefiting from favorable timing relating to certain working capital items. Looking ahead to 2013, we expect our cash flow growth rate to be more in line with our earnings growth rate. Now let me take a moment to update on impact of several additional items that may help you model our business in 2013 starting with commodities. Incremental cost related to our big four commodities, which are sweeteners, metals, juices and PET came in at around $225 million for the full year 2012 in line with what we had provided previously. Looking ahead to 2013, and after considering our hedge positions, we anticipate a more moderate year of commodity inflation with incremental related to our big four commodities coming in at closer to $100 million. As for currencies, we saw headwinds of 4% on our fourth quarter comparable operating income and 5% for the full year 2012, our comparable operating income, consistent with our previously provided an outlook. In preparing for 2013, we are fully hedged on the euro, yen and sterling, and also have the near-term coverage in place across several other currencies. After considering these hedged positions, current spot rates and last week devaluation announcement in Venezuela, we now expect currencies to be a 4% headwind on operating income for the first quarter of 2013, and at even minus 1% headwind for the full year, but it would even quarter before Venezuela maybe slightly negative with Venezuela. We'll also report a $100 million to $225 million devaluation loss in the first quarter related to the monetary asset held in Venezuela. Our normal practice, we'll update our currency forecast on a quarterly basis as we go through 2013. Our full year share repurchases net of employee option exercises totaled $3.1 billion in 2012, just slightly above the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range we communicated at the outset of the year. In 2013, we expect our net share repurchases to range between $3 billion and $3.5 billion. Now let me take a moment to highlight a few other items that will also inform you about our business in 2013. First, as previously announced starting this year, we will have organized our company around three major operating businesses. Coca-Cola International, consisting of Europe, the Pacific and Eurasia and Africa operations. Coca-Cola Americas, consisting of our North America and Latin American operations, and our bottling investments group, which will continue to oversee our company-owned bottling operations outside of North America. As this organizational change does not impact our reporting segments, we'll continue to disclose of performance results for all five geographic operating groups as well as for our Bottling Investment Group. That said, starting with the first quarter 2013, we will reflect our India and Southwest Asian business results within our specific operating group instead of within our Eurasia and Africa operating groups. Prior to our to our next earnings call, we will provide information reclassifying the last three years of our results for these two geographic operating groups to facilitate through historical comparison of our results to our future results. Second, as previously mentioned by Muhtar, there have been several transactions announced these past few months, including bottler mergers in Japan and Brazil and the sale of 51% of our bottling business in the Philippines. To be clear, we do not expect these transactions to have a material impact on our 2013 earnings results. However, these actions will generate a structural headwind on our year-over-year net revenue and operating income growth rates. As such, we anticipate these transactions to have a 3% structural impact on our full year 2013 net revenue. Likewise our full year operating income results should be a 1% structural impact with this decline offset by a corresponding improvement in equity income. As I mentioned, we do not see these transactions having a material impact on 2013 earnings per share. As a final update and as part of our previously announced global productivity and reinvestment program, we are reorganizing our Coca-Cola Refreshments business in the United States to align itself and operating functions around three geographies. Ws. We take this action as part of our consistent effort to improve our processes and systems and to ensure greater operating effectiveness and productivity across our North American operations. This new alignment is in keeping with the ongoing evolution of our North American business model as we invest even further to enhance our capabilities and deliver against our 2020 Vision. In closing and as Muhtar said earlier, we are delivering on our strategic priorities and achieving real success. As we move into 2013, our global bottling system is healthier than ever, and our financial priorities remain clear. We will invest in our core business with plans to spend around $3 billion in capital expenditures in 2013. We will strategically invest with our global bottling system to increase our share position across key growth categories. We will pay a healthy dividend and as previously announced we will repurchase shares between $3 billion and $3.5 billion in 2013. Our system is committed to investing together for a better tomorrow and our proven ability to achieve consistent quality results provides us with the confidence that we will continue to successfully execute our growth strategies with precision in line with our 2020 vision. Before concluding our prepared remarks, I want to remind you that Ahmet, Steve and I look forward to seeing you when we present at the upcoming CAGNY conference in Boca Raton on Friday, February 22 and Irial and I also look forward to being with you when we present together at the CAGE conference in London on Tuesday, March 19. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.\nBill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Good morning. Muhtar, I know you have been doing a lot of globe hopping recently. So maybe you can just talk about the global macro, maybe some granularity about regional growth rates. I know you were at Sochi and Davos, just can you give us some color on how you sense things are going to trend over the next year. I know you have kind of covered this but maybe some more granularity?\nMuhtar Kent: Yes, Bill, I think I have recently been to Korea, to Australia, in the last 10 days to also Southern Russia and Sochi but I think essentially in Europe there is a sentiment there that people are beginning to feel that it is not going to get any worse, that there will be some expansion happening as we move forward and sort of just purely fiscal restraint and monetary restraint. So that feeling is beginning to emerge but I think it is going to be long recovery. Certainly in China we are seeing the transition happened from a purely export led economy to one that is more balanced with consumer spending and a combination consumer spending as well as export led, a balanced economy I think there was challenges in that transition initially where there was a divergence between GDP growth and pure disposable incomes for a while but I think, long-term that\u2019s going to be very beneficial for every one, this transition in China. I think in general Japan is going to also, the consumer sentiment will continue to be mobile and volatile there and it is subdued. For the rest of the world, whether it's Africa, the youngest billion, Latin America, Eurasia, our Middle East, we see and of course, Asia, Southeast Asia and other parts of Asia, Indian subcontinent, we see growth, we see very disciplined, monetary policy, balanced budgets, good banking system and the consumer is more positive, and so it's modeled, and it's mixed here into United States, we see some signs of improvement. We need to wait and evaluate the impact of the payroll taxes as well as the higher gasoline prices. It's too early to say that it's a recovery that is at best look on, but we feel that it could get better. That's how we see the world, and based on that we continue to invest for opportunity, we continue to invest based on our long-term models and plans with our bottling partners to continue to generate both, volume, top line and income growth.\nBill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Great. Thanks very much. Then a follow-up with the change in the structure of CCR North America, I mean, does this change your philosophy on sort of how long you are going to own the asset and maybe how it's going to be operated going forward.\nMuhtar Kent: Sorry. Are you talking about just the restructuring?\nBill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Exactly, three different regions, I guess there were seven businesses and now there is three. Does that change your view on how long that asset stays with GCC?\nMuhtar Kent: Yes. It's got nothing to do with that that at all. Think if it as last year we announced a new productivity reinvestment program that includes continued synergies from our North America CCR, Coca-Cola Refreshment operations to be able to enable us to continue to invest in our brands to grow in North America, 11 consecutive quarters of growth. When we first talked about growth in North America back in '09, people thought that we were trying to go to the moon without lighter, and now its reality 11 quarters of consecutive growth and we intend to continue that. We see this as a growth market and therefore enabled us to continue to invest in our brands. This is just ordinary course of business. Think about it exactly like that It's not a big deal, ordinary course of business and therefore it's got nothing to do with the United States' bottling structure. It's just part of our ongoing business and I'll have Steve Cahillane is here with me on this call, as well as, Ahmet Bozer in area of finance, so I can ask Steve to also comment.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. You said it very well. This is very much an effectiveness play. Two years ago, when we put these businesses together, we had a simple mantra. First was, we're going to make it work. Then we were going to make it better than then we were going to make it best. We've learned a lot over the course of last two-and-a-half years. One of our most successful organizations is our food service organization, which is aligned around three geographic units. we're moving our national retail sales and our field sales organization also around the same two units which will really build our total efficiency and effectiveness, our ability to work together, our ability to continue to invest in this market, invest against our brands, put more feet on the street, so we are very excited about new organization in Bangalore, to get us from making it better to making it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bill Pecoriello of Consumer Edge Research.\nBill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research: Good morning, everybody. I just wanted to re-clarify one thing first Gary. Hitting the long-term FX neutral operating profit target you expect to do that in 2013 as well as in the long run. And then in with closing euro operating expense leverage guided for '13 despite the savings, you're signaling step up spending, so just want to get an idea of where you are focusing that incremental spending on. Thanks.\nGary Fayard: Thanks, Bill. Yes. And, I was trying to be pretty clear, but let me be very clear. We expect to hit our long-term growth target targets both, in 2013 and long-term. That applies to 2013 as well, so we are comfortable with that and we would expect to be able to deliver that. The second thing is, we have always had demand to invest through a crisis. We've been in a global crisis for a number of years now, but we've got history and we've seen what happens when you invest through the crisis when you come at the other end, as Muhtar says, we see things slowly improving across the globe, but we expect to come out that the other end much stronger than we were even going in. And so, we are going to continue to drive efficiencies, productivity and then reinvestment that back to grow the business and growing the brand. The brands are stronger than they have ever been but we think we can drive it even further. So we are going to continue to invest behind the brands.\nMuhtar Kent: Just one point to add on that, Bill. I always say, as you go up the air gets thinner. Always remember, we are adding on top of significant increases from prior years all the time. Just on sparkling beverages alone, we have added over 0.5 billion cases each year. So we are cycling that every year and we are continuing to grow. I think that is really important and in three years, the worse that gets probably macroeconomic environment we have seen for a long time, we were able to generate volume growth in line with our growth expectations, revenue growth in line with our growth expectations and income growth and generating record revenues of $48 billion record income as well as record cash flow. So I think it needs to be taken into that context. Continue to crack the calculus for growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: So, Muhtar, I know you spoke a lot about the macro environment but maybe you can speak a little bit about the competitive environment particularly around U.S. sparkling, China and parts of Western Europe where you have seen some step up in competitive pressure and how that's affected your volume performance and how you see that trending in 2013?\nMuhtar Kent: I think in the United States where, as you have heard, we continued to gain both volume and value share. All over the world, our share is at an all-time high. Everywhere across the world in NARTD as well as in the different categories that were operating in and competing in and we choose to compete in. Similarly in China in sparkling we have widened our gap to our nearest international competitor in sparkling. In Europe, I there has been a month or two where we have had some challenges but overall for the whole year, we have again gained share across the whole of broader Europe, in Western Europe as well as Eastern Europe and in Southeast Europe across the whole continent, in both volume and value share. To be frank, we see competition is healthy and it keeps us on our toes, it keeps us executing better and being better, becoming more efficient and more productive and all we strive every single day as the business system together with our assembly by bottlers around the world as we strive to get better at making decisions, quicker so that we can be more nimble and more innovative. As you know we have launched more than 800 types of different products over the last four or five years. Many of them are new innovative products that are gaining great traction as they are in the United States. Look at the performance of our still business. Look at the relative performance of our sparkling business. I mentioned that between 2009 and 2012, spend per person on our brands went up from $56 to $60. So transactions are up the United States. Our brand, price, package and channel allocation architecture is working in the United States. So both in China transactions are ahead of our volume as well as in the United States immediate consumption business. So judge us not only by pure volume, judge us by the quality of our volume and transaction growth. We sell and the end-consumers buy packages and products, a combination of packages and products, each one at a time. They don\u2019t buy liters. So that is really important thing to understand and how we think about it.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay, and then Gary just following up on currency guidance for the full year. So it seems like the first quarter guidance is actually a little bit worse than I thought. So can you just help us understand, is that based on our hedge position and with the Yen moving pretty sharply how much are you hedge spending in?\nGary Fayard: Judy, we are actually fully hedged on the Yen, Euro and Sterling. So coming back to the last Yen position that we have are actually on the money, they are in a good place. So that\u2019s not an issue. When you look at the first quarter, it was actually, I said 4%, it was pre-Venezuela, 4.5%. So the Venezuela devaluation obviously is a big one when devalued 50%. So that's number one. But number two, the real impact is not what you would expect. It's not the yen, the impact are the rates that were cycling in the emerging markets particularly, Latin America. If you look at Brazil, look at Mexico, goes look at the rate at early last year and then they started devaluing South Africa as well. So, if you look at those you will see improving trend, so towards the latter part of 2013, based on where spot is today, we actually turned positive all with kind of even to minus 1 for the full year, but it's frontend loaded negative and then it is improving throughout the year.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: And then on Venezuela, Gary, just the impact you are purely looking at translational impact or some sort of margin impact as you have the pricing control in place?\nGary Fayard: We've got a wealth of monitor assets. That was 100 to 125, and so if you look in the Wall Street Journal article this morning, we just were on a list of other companies that have the same issue, so that's kind of a one-time items, but I am just telling you has occurred, will occur. Then the translation impact of the revenues will be about 1% drag in the first quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Faucher with JPMC.\nJohn Faucher - JPMC: Thank you. Just two questions here. Gary, just sort of more of a housekeeping type of thing, as you look at the commentary on the net interest line, it seems as though that can create a situation and there is probably not much leverage if any below the operating lines. If you could just sort of confirm that. And then secondly, as we look at the organic top line growth in terms of just simply the bottler case sales, volume less price mix decelerated. It looks like to me at least every quarter this year, so can you talk about how you see that trending up as we go through the course of 2012. You got difficult comparisons in the first half of the year, and sort of how that's going to play into your comfort level of hitting that 6% to 8% currency neutral operating profit target. Thanks.\nGary Fayard: Sure, John. Yes. Let me see if I can get the first half of your question. First, the low operating income growth, you are right, because we will see net interest flow from interest income to interest expense. There are a couple of things going on in there. Primarily its rates and just rates are down, particularly in some of the emerging markets where we've got some cash, which was generating a lot of interest income. You saw that happening during the latter part of this year and all the reason that interest income was actually a lot better than in the fourth quarter than I told you to expected to be was actually we put on some interest rate swap hedges a couple of years ago. There is a small ineffectiveness piece to that hedge and ineffective piece has to go through the P&L. That was actually pretty large this quarter, positive and it gave us lot of interest income, so that's part of what you are seeing. In equity income, you are going to get some leverage just going to be up because of structural items that talked about from some of the transactions that have occurred. Then if we go to the second half of your question was tell me again?\nJohn Faucher - JPMC: Just looking at the deceleration in the organic top line growth and again how that maps out over the course of the year and the comfort on, let's say, the 6% there?\nGary Fayard: Well, I think there are a couple of different things. There, I think, we are going to see improving and slowly improving trends in many of the markets around the world. Europe, I think, will improve. My expectation is that Europe will improve in 2013 from well, we had pretty good improvement from the fourth quarter of 2012. So I would say, you are going to actually see sequential improvement in Europe, you are going to see sequential improvement in China for sure. I think that U.S. is poised now also in a pretty good place. Number one, I think, volumes in 2012 dipped a little bit in the fourth quarter. Our view is that is not the start of a trend. We think that just it happened but it is not the start of a trend and we would expect volume actually to be okay in 2013 and we think it will sequentially start coming back and be better and be okay in 2013.\nIrial Finan: John, just to add on that. I think very little is always said about the 120 or so countries which have a per capita around 125 in our business where volume growth for just 2012 will again 7%. These countries represented about a little more than one third of our total global volumes. Countries that we never talk about. Whether it is Sub-Sahara or whether it is in Asia or Middle East or Central Asia and so forth. But we grew in these countries 9% in 2010, 7% in 2011, 7% in 2012. We keep on growing. This is the beauty of our portfolio, in fact. So while you may have a quarter where China doesn\u2019t grow, or where Europe doesn\u2019t grow, we still continue to be able to deliver on our long-term growth model, both volume and also for revenues. Imagine what would have happened to our volume if Europe did grow this past quarter and China. So this is that the benefit of having this portfolio which is getting stronger and bigger as we continue to invest with our bottling partners in alignment.\nJohn Faucher - JPMC: Okay, and then finally one housekeeping question. Gary you mentioned the equity income line. That\u2019s coming out of the operating profit line. So as you look at hitting your target, I am assuming that\u2019s before the bottler deconsolidation, right? So that 6% to 8%, minus one for the bottler minus one for the FX, is kind of how we should look at it?\nGary Fayard: Yes, John. That is exactly right. So when I said, hit the target, we hit the target before structural but then you would have to adjust for structural. That's with pretax or net income being sign. This is just what is the geographies within the P&L.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein: Can you give us a little bit more of a sense of against the go forward evolution of the brands globally and in the U.S.? If you look at Germany, that strength this quarter and you wanted to do some system changes there, Japan showing inconsistent changes and that\u2019s a struggle, China is struggling a little bit and there were competitive system changes there, also the U.S. sparkling bottling just got tough and you have got it back to a year ago. Gary has pointed volume trends are a trend or not, it just seems that given all that, you might actually for next few years with very large changes through the Coca-Cola system and the industry overall, so if you were to close your eyes and see with us, how would you see the structure of the system of the future looking versus what it is today?\nGary Fayard: Ali, I have always said that the fact that we are a total believer in the franchise system. It is a beautiful system when you get to work as we have aligned in four divisions, aligned with its goals and aligned in its ownership objectives and goals. That\u2019s what we have. Therefore we will continue to drive this bottling system with an aligned vision which we have. As I said, we have got three years that we have accomplished that and seven years to go and we are confident that we can continue to accomplish. As we move through the system, you have already heard us talk about what we see in the business for the U.S. system where we have a role, again, for our bottling partners. We still have the same time table for that. I won't repeat that the time table was. We said about four to five years since the time that we close the transaction and you can figure we still believe that this doable. As we move along different parts of the world, you see us creating stronger systems like Brazil, stronger systems like Kanto. That is a huge milestone in the 55 year history of our Japanese business getting the four Kanto bottlers to unite and to take cost out of it and continue to invest to drive top line growth for our system. You will see us doing well as we move forward. Again refranchising Philippines is another example, so don't think of this as seismic changes in our bottling system. We will continue to fine-tune and evolve as needed as necessary to drive the goals that we have outlined.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein: It's helpful, I guess I am still struggling with what can we look forward to changes in terms of not being as reactionary, but maybe thinking going forward and maybe if you can help me? You mentioned the U.S. you mentioned a little while ago, so it's been about two years since you closed the CCE North America transaction. Can you give us a sense of where you think you are ahead of plan and where you are behind plan? Certainly for many investors this quarter was probably (inaudible) because operating margin starts inflect positively, but is it sustainable without any more meaningful restructuring and bigger things? How do you think about the volume trends we have been seeing so far in sparkling when that changes anything how you think not reactionarily, but going forward about the structures here. A different example of.\nGary Fayard: Well, first, let me just say everywhere we are doing, none of it is reactionary to these four, whether it's Brazil, whether it's Philippines, whether it's Japan and we've got more to talk about too, we are not in a position to talk about right now. All of that is actually prices and U.S. is all about prices. And I can tell you very clearly, once again that as I mentioned in Judy's question judges not only by the meters, judges also by the transaction, judges by how we are doing in terms of value of the business that we are creating and the consumer spend that's coming into our business into our brand and the health of our brands. This is ultimately a brand business. Our brands are healthier than they have ever been both, in sparkling as well as in still beverages. So, I repeat, we see opportunities in the United States for us to keep growing and also for us to keep generating value in both sparkling and in still beverages, and that's how we see it and whatever it takes for us to be able to investment, proactive long-term investment is the key, whatever it takes for us to be able to continue our targeted thoughtful, purposeful investments you will see us continuing to do that, so that we our brands remain healthy, our system remains nimble and flexible as far as rest the market as far as production NSR distribution.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: Hi, good morning. A kind of question on just the productivity program, just really looking for an update. First, I think if you test the two elements of it, both what was initially announced last year plus the extension of the CCR integration, your expectation was $550 million to $650 million annualized savings by the end of 2015, so is that still the same or has there been any change to what you are expecting in terms of total savings?\nGary Fayard: Bryan, this is Gary. No changes at all. You are exactly right. What we announced the beginning of last year productivity and reinvestment was $550 million to $650 million. The total company, including North America we are still on track in fact well on track on that program. It was a 2012 through 2015 program and we are continuing to execute against that. So, we are on track. We are taking the savings and from the supply chain optimization, the marketing effectiveness, operational excellence, data and that the system standardization was area of that of that whole program in addition to what we were doing in CCR, and we have taken that and we are reinvesting behind innovation as well as marketing of or brands. And that's still working well. What we talked about in North America just today is just a normal part in evolution of that program and we'll continue to do that around the world to drive effectiveness, because it really helps in several different ways It's not only about saving money. It's about operating more effectively, so we can operate faster. Being more productive means we can make decisions quicker and those are things we are driving for. We want to be fast, flexible and very big.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: How much did it continue to drive? How much savings did you drive in 2012?\nGary Fayard: Outside of North America, we probably had about $40 million to $50 million in savings in 2012. Then North America continues to drive synergies and doing fairly well against their part of their targets as well.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: It is fair to say you think certainly it will be a bigger, (inaudible) you pulled the savings to spend back than you had in '12?\nGary Fayard: Yes, it will be.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: Okay, and then just one last one. Just how much, in terms of charges are you expecting to take over the life of the plan relative to the savings?\nGary Fayard: Let me, Brain, answer it this way. As we continue to update you on where we are how big the plan is. So we will call it back to the 650 today but as you know, a few years ago, we had another program as well that we concluded and started this one. So we continue to look for efficiencies and effectiveness. But everything we look at when we evaluated, we would expect that the one time cost ought to be in a ratio of no more of 1 to 1.5:1 payback. So you are taking about 12 to 18 months on something that\u2019s then continuous benefit to the P&L going forward.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Gary, Ahmet, Steve, Irial and Jackson. In closing, we had a strong 2012 and we once again delivered quality full-year performance results. Our business continues to grow, even in the midst of ongoing global economic challenges. Our system is aligned and it is on track to achieve our 2020 Vision. Together, we are consistently investing in our brands on a global scale through world-class marketing and commercial strategies. As we get closer to the midpoint of our 2020 Vision, our system remains resolutely focused on refreshing our achievements, creating value for our customers, maintaining strong partnerships with our bottling partners, strategically investing for the future and expanding shareholder value. As always, we thank you for your interest and your investment in our company and for joining us on this call.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call with The Coca-Cola Company.

In addition, I would also like to note that we have posted schedules on our company website at www.thecoca-colacompany.com under the Reports and Financial Information tab in the Investors section, which reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to by our senior executives in our discussions this morning, and from time to time in discussing our financial performance to our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Please look on our website for this information. Now let me turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that we're pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. We continue to deliver consistent quality results, with our business growing worldwide volume by 4% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date. Importantly, we realized positive growth across all 5 of our geographic operating groups this quarter despite facing a still uncertain global economy. Together with our global system, we are operating from a position of real strength. This past quarter, we built on this advantage by once again leading industry growth and extending our volume and value share gains globally in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. We gained global share in the sparkling beverage category, where our portfolio is up 3% in both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. To put this in perspective, our global sparkling business has generated nearly 450 million incremental cases year-to-date or the equivalent of adding another Russia to our global business. And this growth has been consistently and reliably led by brand Coca-Cola, which has grown every quarter over the past 3.5 years and is up a healthy 3% year-to-date. We also gained global share in the still beverage category, where our portfolio grew a solid 10% in the quarter and 9% year-to-date. This quarter's still beverage results were well balanced, with high single-digit growth in juice and juice drinks and sports drinks, as well as double-digit growth in the water, energy and ready-to-drink tea categories. We are committed to striking a sound balance between the growth of our sparkling and still beverages. We see this balance as the key to growing our total business while sustainably enhancing our margins and profits, in line with our 2020 Vision. We're also committed to providing consumers more choice in brands, beverage types and calories or no calories, all of which contributes new growth to our business. The balance results that we have achieved across our portfolio demonstrate that we are delivering on this commitment. As we've shared during our prior earnings calls this year, we recognize that consumers across the globe are still feeling the effects of the prolonged uncertainty in Europe, the ongoing cooling of the economy in China and a mild recovery in the United States. We believe these global macroeconomic pressures will extend through 2012 and likely into 2013. Despite this, we are heartened by our ability to consistently deliver quality results, as well as by our global systems commitment to invest in the business for the long-term growth. We're also encouraged by how we have successfully and systematically adapted our business model these past few years to readily address the changing demands of the global marketplace. First, we better positioned our company to capture North America's long-term growth opportunity by acquiring CCE's North America business. Our North America business has delivered volume growth every quarter since we executed this important transaction. Second, we broadened the relevance of our Bottling Investments Group, evolving it further from its initial role of fixing challenging markets to a more significant role of spiriting our growth in select strategic markets, such as India and China. Constant renewal is in our DNA. Now with solid fundamentals and real momentum in our business, we are ready to take the next step towards our 2020 Vision. As announced last quarter, effective January 1, 2013, we're organizing our company around 3 major operating businesses: Coca-Cola International, consisting of our Europe, Pacific and Eurasia & Africa operations; Coca-Cola Americas, consisting of our North America and Latin America operations; and Bottling Investments Group, which will continue to oversee our company-owned bottling operations outside of North America. By consolidating leadership of our global operations under 2 large and similar-sized geographic regions, as well as in our Bottling Investments Group, we will streamline reporting lines and intensify our focus on key markets. This newly evolved structure will also enable us to better leverage synergies and more flexibly adjust our business strategies within those geographies in the future. All of this will further strengthen our efforts to achieve long-term sustainable growth as we advance our momentum towards our 2020 Vision. Now let's review our performance across our global markets in more detail, beginning with our flagship market, North America. This past quarter, our business in North America delivered its 10th consecutive quarter of growth, up 2% for the quarter and year-to-date. We also captured volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages while sustaining a positive 3% price mix for our total North America beverage business. Our growth in North America was once again driven by our still beverage portfolio, which was up 7% this quarter. This is the 10th consecutive quarter that our North America still beverage portfolio has either maintained or gained both volume and value share. In sports drinks, POWERADE grew volume 9% this quarter while also leading the North America sports drink category in absolute unit case volume growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Our juice and juice drinks portfolio in North America outpaced the category, up 6% for the quarter while gaining both volume and value share. Our positive result in this category was broad-based, driven by strong growth in our juice drinks business, volume and value share growth across our Minute Maid Light portfolio, and further value share gains in the 100% chilled orange juice segment. Our glac\u00e9au brands were up mid-single digits in North America once again this quarter, gaining both volume and value share, and led by the 18th straight quarter of double-digit growth for our premium smartwater brand. The rest of our North America water business grew 4% in the quarter, led by DASANI, which maintained its premium price position, and saw further gains across key brand equity measures, driven by consumer awareness of our innovative PlantBottle packaging. And our key portfolio in North America sustained its momentum, up double digits while gaining both volume and value share. This result was led by Gold Peak, which has now grown strong double digits for 22 consecutive quarters. Our sparkling beverages in North America were even in the third quarter, a sequential improvement over our second quarter results and ahead of the broader sparkling beverage industry. Importantly, our sparkling beverage portfolio earned a positive 3% price mix in both the quarter and year-to-date in what continues to be a rational pricing environment. Coca-Cola Zero growth accelerated, up 9% this quarter. We also sustained our momentum behind Fanta, which was up mid-single digits for the third consecutive quarter. We are encouraged by our consistent progress in North America, and we remain positive about the long-term outlook for this very important market. We're also leading the effort across communities in the United States to tackle obesity. Last week, we joined fellow members of the beverage industry to announce the first-of-its-kind partnership with the cities of Chicago and San Antonio, encouraging the citizens of these cities to be more health aware and physically active. We introduced a city-to-city wellness challenge, as well as our new Calories Count Vending Program that will provide consumers with the choices and information they need to choose beverages that are right for themselves and for their families. When it comes to non-communicable diseases such as obesity, we know that there are no simple answers. But we also know that a lack of physical activity is a primary contributor to obesity. We also know that there is a lack of understanding of how many calories people consume in a day. As such, our company is committed to partnering with customers and cities to promote active, healthy, balanced lifestyles, as well as making calorie information more transparent. Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which grew 3% in the third quarter and 6% year-to-date. Our business in Japan was up 2% this quarter, bringing our year-to-date volume growth in Japan to 3%. Japan has now delivered volume growth in 8 of the last 9 quarters. Our business in Japan continues to gain share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages this quarter and also grew both volume and value share in still beverages. This positive result was driven by the sustained momentum of our Georgia coffee brand and water and sports drink category offerings, which led to consistent volume growth across channels, including drugstores, convenience retail outlet, as well as supermarkets. Looking ahead and consistent with what we said during our last earnings call, we expect our fourth quarter volume results in Japan to moderate somewhat below our year-to-date trend as we cycle strong growth from prior year. Having said that, our business in Japan is on track to deliver full year low-single-digit growth. Moving now to China. Our business delivered 2% volume growth this quarter, cycling last year's double-digit growth. On a year-to-date basis, our volume in China has grown 6%, cycling strong 15% growth from last year. And once again, this quarter, we captured both volume and value share in sparkling beverages. Importantly and in alignment with our strategic priorities in China, we are growing transactions ahead of volume, with total transactions up 10% year-to-date. One package that is helping us deliver against that strategy is our 300 ml, milliliter, package. On a year-to-date basis, this new package has generated over 0.5 billion incremental transactions in China. We will keep driving our 300 ml package to provide consumers with a great offering at the right price point while also building our brands and the sparkling category in a healthy way over the long term. As we look ahead to the next 6 months, it is reasonable to expect that China's ongoing economic slowdown may have a short-term effect on our industry and on our business. In our view, the Chinese economy is undergoing a natural and necessary economic transition as the government places greater emphasis on controlling long-term inflation over injecting short-term economic stimulus. While the Chinese economy undergoes this period of transition, we have every confidence in the long-term resilience of our business for 3 key reasons. First, our brands in China are strong. In our latest survey of consumers aged 12 to 49 years old, Coca-Cola was rated as both the most favorite sparkling and nonalcoholic ready-to-drink brand. In this same survey, Minute Maid was rated as the most favorite juice drinks brand. Second, we hold the leadership position in the sparkling category. This is the ninth consecutive quarter in which our sparkling beverages in China either maintained or gained both volume and value share. And third, our system in China is strategically focused, well aligned and committed to invest for sustainable long-term growth. As such, we remain encouraged and excited about our opportunities in this region and continue to believe that China will serve as the long-term growth driver for our business. I also want to share our perspective on a few other markets in the Pacific that are exhibiting strong growth, starting with Thailand, which again delivered double-digit growth, up a sound 19% this quarter. Thailand growth was led by brand Coca-Cola, which was up 26% in the quarter and 34% year-to-date. I also want to highlight our result in South Korea, another market which has grown double digits in both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. As additional context, our business in South Korea has nearly doubled since 2007. This is a testament to our system's ability to implement a robust set of occasion-based price and packaging offerings to consumers and drive growth across this region. We're excited about the growth opportunities in both Thailand and South Korea, and we'll keep investing for the future in these vibrant markets. Moving now to Latin America, our volume grew 5% for both the quarter, as well as year-to-date. As in previous quarters, this growth was led by brand Coca-Cola, up 3% in both the quarter and year-to-date. In Latin America, we once again captured both volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Our 2 largest markets in Latin America, Mexico and Brazil, were both up a solid 6% this past quarter while also growing volume and value share in sparkling, still and also the entire nonalcoholic ready-to-drink category. Importantly, our growth in both these markets was well balanced across all categories. Mexico grew sparkling beverages 3%, and still beverages were up double digits for the quarter. Similarly, Brazil delivered 4% sparkling beverage growth and double-digit still beverage growth for the quarter. Brazil was up 5% on a year-to-date basis. In light of these strong results, we now expect our 2012 growth in Brazil to be in the mid-single digits. Let me also share our perspective on a few other markets in Latin America that we see as great opportunities for long-term growth; specifically, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Together, these markets are 1/3 the size of our current Brazilian business. Our system is very focused on implementing the same winning strategies in these markets that have driven such positive results in Brazil this past decade. We will keep investing in Colombia, investing in Ecuador and Peru and across the entire Latin America region, as we execute our 2020 Vision. As such, it is easy to see why we are excited about the long-term growth opportunity represented by these 3 dynamic Latin American markets. Our Eurasia & Africa business extended its strong momentum, growing a solid 11% in both the quarter and year-to-date, including 11% year-to-date growth for brand Coca-Cola. During the quarter, our business in Eurasia & Africa grew both volume and value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. On a country level, India once again led this group's performance, delivering balanced and consistent quality growth. Our business in India was up 15% for the quarter, with double-digit growth and volume and value share gains realized across both sparkling and still beverages. Sparkling beverage growth in India was led by brand Coca-Cola, up over 30% for the second consecutive quarter, as we sustained our focus on immediate consumption offerings. And still beverages in India were led by our juice drink brands, with Maaza up over 20% again in the quarter. Russia was up 7% in both the quarter and year-to-date, with the strong result driven by the further acceleration of brand Coca-Cola, which grew 18% in the quarter and 20% year-to-date. Like last quarter, we observed similarly strong results across our broader sparkling portfolio in Russia, with Fanta up 15% and Sprite up 7%. And our Dobriy juice brand built on its recent success, delivering 16% growth in the quarter and raising this brand's year-to-date performance up to 12%. Our strong performance across the Eurasia & Africa Group was supported by our partnership with Aujan. We're excited about the further growth opportunities represented by our partnership with Aujan, which holds the #1 position in the still beverage business across the entire Middle East. And our collaborations in Eurasia & Africa extend beyond business relationships, as exemplified by our partnership with The Global Fund to bring critical medicines to rural Africa. At last month's Clinton Global Initiative, we announced our plans to expand the reach of project Last Mile, which was established in 2010 to help Tanzania's government-run medicine distribution network build a more efficient supply chain by leveraging our expansive distribution system and core business expertise. Nearly 20 million Africans have benefited from this partnership since 2010. The newest phase of this partnership will increase the availability of medicines to 75% of Tanzania and expand the project's reach to Ghana and Mozambique. The success of this project demonstrates our belief in the power of civil society, government and the private sector, or what we call the Golden Triangle, working closely together to solve real global issues and problems. Moving now to Europe. We saw our business return to growth, up a solid 1% for the quarter. These results were achieved despite the continuation of unseasonably poor weather in the first half of the quarter, as well as the impact of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Even with these external headwinds, all 4 of our European business units saw positive growth this quarter, demonstrating our ability to execute with excellence across this entire region. Germany once again led the region, up 3% for the quarter and 2% year-to-date. This marks Germany's seventh consecutive quarter of positive growth. And while our business in Germany is winning today, we are connecting with consumers to ensure continued success for tomorrow. An example of this was our award-winning Coca-Cola summer campaign in Germany, which was named the best 2012 out-of-home campaign by Germany's leading marketing industry weekly. Understanding that music is a passion point for teenagers, our campaign in Germany leveraged our global partnership with Spotify, a leading music streaming platform, to offer teenagers access to millions of songs and exclusive Coca-Cola content. This campaign generated more than 1.5 billion contacts and reached more than 90% of all teenagers in Germany as they created their own Coca-Cola playlists and shared them with their friends via Facebook. We are successfully applying the same consumer engagement principles across regions, as exemplified by our highly successful global activation of the 2012 London Summer Olympic Games. Our internal indicators show that the marketing programs we executed across almost 100 markets drove global improvements in recruitment, frequency and brand equity with our consumers. Our television commercials were acknowledged by Ace Metrix as consistently being among the highest-rated ads during the Olympics. Our efforts across the digital and mobile space were also recognized. We received a Digital Gold Award by Unmetric, a brand tracker, who analyzed the social media performance of every major sponsor. And we were honored with the Global Marketer of the Year award by the Mobile Marketing Association while also taking home a Best in Show nod at their awards ceremony for our Olympic Games Move to the Beat campaign. Our social media programs' success goes well beyond our Olympics activation. Over just the last 9 months, Coca-Cola's Facebook page has grown by over 40%. This past quarter, Coca-Cola became the first brand to achieve over 50 million likes. And as of today, this number has increased further, surpassing 52 million. This rise parallels the growth of our social engagements footprint across all major social networks that generate conversation and content with our consumers. The recent study by PQ Media found that Coca-Cola was the #1 brand in social media impressions by nearly a 2:1 margin over the next most-mentioned brand. Another area of emphasis for our system is to support sustainable communities by replenishing 100% of the water used in our finished beverages by 2020. To advance this goal, we recently announced the global clean water partnership with DEKA Research & Development to bring clean water to communities where potable water access is limited. This partnership will leverage innovative technology to deliver clean drinking water to schools, health clinics and community centers in rural regions of Africa, Asia and Latin America. When fully scaled, this partnership is expected to add more than 0.5 billion liters of clean drinking water per year to the global water supply. While water is the lifeblood of our business, we're committed to doing our part to replenish the water we use and give back to communities we proudly serve. By partnering with DEKA, we hope to empower local entrepreneurs with a specific focus on women by delivering, as well as maintaining, a clean water solution for communities and improving the daily lives of thousands of people around the world. Finally, we were humbled and honored earlier this month when brand Coca-Cola topped the list of Interbrand's Best Global Brands rankings. Interbrand has rated Coca-Cola as the #1 brand on its list every year since 2000. This is a testament to our ongoing commitment to invest in our brands, innovate our marketing and engage with our consumers in a sustainable manner that builds long-term value. Certainly, the world has been very volatile from a macroeconomic perspective over the last 4 years. As a global company and also on behalf of all our associates, I'm pleased to say that we continue to crack the calculus for growth in this challenging and volatile environment. We've done this by consistently increasing our investments in our system and our brands to ensure that our global portfolio is more relevant and healthier today than it's ever been during our history. We remain resolutely focused on ensuring that we leverage our unique heritage and fuse it with what is expected by our consumers today in order to earn and sustain our place in their daily lives today and tomorrow. I want to thank all of our consumers who invite us into their lives 1.8 billion times each and every day. And I want to thank all of our shareholders for your interest and investment in our company. It's a great responsibility. You can rest assured that our entire leadership team is working diligently to protect and grow the value of your investment in our company, both today and for tomorrow. So with that, let me now turn the call over to Gary.\nGary P. Fayard: Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another quarter of solid performance results, reflecting our global system's ability to consistently execute our strategic plans while managing through a still unpredictable macroeconomic environment. As you'll recall, I provided a commentary about the third quarter during our last earnings call because we knew there were several unique timing and cycling factors to consider when modeling the third quarter. Taking these factors into account, I'm pleased to say that our third quarter results were consistent with the commentary we provided in our last earnings call. And as such, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year volume, revenue and operating income results in line with our long-term growth targets. So let me start our review with our third quarter results with our comparable earnings per share, which came in at $0.51 this quarter and at $1.56 on a year-to-date basis, up 2% year-to-date despite facing considerable currency headwinds throughout the year. Our comparable currency-neutral operating income was up 1% this quarter, in line with our expectations. And on a comparable basis, the impact of currency on this quarter's operating income results was a 7% headwind. On a year-to-date basis, our comparable currency-neutral operating income is up 4%, also in line with our expectations. As per my previous comment, we expect to deliver full year operating income results in line with our long-term growth targets, and we understand that this implies we will achieve double-digit comparable currency-neutral operating income growth in the fourth quarter. Comparable currency-neutral net revenues grew 6% in the quarter. The currency impact on this quarter's comparable net revenue results was a 5% headwind. On a year-to-date basis, comparable currency-neutral net revenue growth is also at 6%. As we discuss profit and revenue growth rates, let me take a moment to remind everyone that the profits and revenues generated by some of our more recent strategic partnerships, including Aujan and Innocent, among others, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. So while unit cases related to these businesses are fully reflected in our volume growth, their associated concentrate sales or concentrate gallons-associated profits and revenues are not currently contributing to our operating income and revenue growth rates. Instead, these profits are consolidated into our equity income results. While this did not materially impact our third quarter results, I think it's important because there is an impact on growth rates. Returning now to a review of our third quarter results, our concentrate sales came in slightly ahead of unit case volume by approximately 0.5%. As a reminder, growth rates for concentrate sales and unit cases can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Having said that, concentrate sales are in line with unit cases year-to-date, and we expect our full year concentrate sales growth to be in line with unit case volume growth. As for our consolidated price mix, this came in slightly positive in the quarter, rounding to even, consistent with outlook we provided in our last quarter call. On a year-to-date basis, our consolidated price mix is up 2%. We continue to expect our full year 2012 consolidated price mix results to come in between 1% and 2%, in line with our long-term target range. Our third quarter comparable gross margins were in line with our second quarter comparable gross margins. This was a slight improvement over the estimate we provided during our last earnings call, as we successfully offset some of the currency and mix shift headwinds faced by our business. For the full year, we still expect our comparable gross margins to come in below our second and third quarter comparable gross margins. On comparable currency-neutral SG&A expenses, they were up 8% in the quarter and 6% year-to-date. These results include a mid-single-digit increase in our third quarter direct marketing expenses, as we continue to invest in the health and strength of our brands. Our third quarter SG&A also reflects an increase due to the timing of certain operating expenses, as well as the cost of adding incremental feet on the street, primarily in North America, in support of our growing business. And one point of both our quarter and year-to-date SG&A rate is related to the impact of structural items, primarily in our Bottling Investments Group and North American business. As we look to the rest of the year, we expect our full year SG&A to come in close to our current year-to-date rate. Our operating expense leverage was minus 4 points this quarter, right in line with the minus 3- to a minus 5-point range that we estimated during our last earnings call. As we've stated in our last call, we expect this trend to reverse in the fourth quarter, as we benefit from having 2 additional selling days. This should enable us to achieve slightly positive operating expense leverage on a full year basis. Our net interest came in at a positive $16 million in the third quarter, which is ahead of our initial expectations. This raised our year-to-date net interest income to $43 million. Looking ahead, we still expect our net interest to come in as an expense in the fourth quarter, primarily due to expected lower rates in some of our international locations, as well as ongoing currency headwinds. As a result, we're updating our full year net interest income outlook to a $30 million to $40 million range. Our underlying effective tax rate held steady at 24%, and we expect to carry this 24% tax rate into next year. And our cash flow from operations increased a very healthy and very strong 15% year-to-date. Our year-to-date share repurchases, net of employee stock option exercises, totaled $2.3 billion, placing us well on track to achieve the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range for full year 2012 that we communicated at the outset of this year. With regard to commodities, in our last call, we reduced the estimated full year incremental impact of our Big 4 commodity cost on our results to $300 million. Based on our latest forecast and hedge positions, we now expect our full year incremental cost of commodities will come in at approximately $225 million. As for currencies, we previously provided an outlook that we would have an 8% to 9% headwind on an operating income in the third quarter. Today, I can confirm that currency came in slightly better than our initial outlook, resulting in a 7% headwind on third quarter comparable operating income. Based on our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we continue to expect currencies to be a mid-single-digit headwind on our operating income in both the fourth quarter and on a full year basis. In closing, and as Muhtar said earlier, we are strategically and successfully advancing our global momentum while navigating through a challenging global economy. Our system is focused on maximizing economic profit and long-term cash flow, which allows us to continue to reinvest in the business and anticipate changes in the marketplace and competitive dynamics. While we have made several important and strategic investments this year, our financial priorities remain the same. We'll reinvest in the core business. We still expect to spend around $3 billion in capital expenditures in 2012. We will strategically invest in acquisitions and partnerships, the strength in our bottling system, and to increase our position in key nonalcoholic ready-to-drink growth categories. We will continue to pay dividends. In 2012, we increased our quarterly dividend 8.5%, and we have returned $4.3 billion in dividends to shareholders in 2011. And further, we expect our Board of Directors to approve another quarterly dividend this week, which by the way will be paid in December of this year, as it has been every year since 1934. And we'll continue to repurchase shares with excess cash. In our current program, which we started in 2006, we've already repurchased 533 million shares at an average price of $31.17. Since our share repurchase program started in 1984, we have repurchased 2.9 billion shares at an average price of $12.55. As a result of our strong cash flow and that of our bottlers, I remain very confident that we can continue to invest and deliver our long-term growth targets on a sustainable basis to achieve our 2020 Vision and deliver value to our shareowners. Operator, we're now ready for questions.\nOperator: Our first question today comes from Bill Pecoriello from Consumer Edge Research.\nWilliam Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: Gary, you talked about the double-digit operating profit growth expected for Q4 versus the 4% year-to-date, I think it's something like 14% you need to hit the 6% lower end of the long-term range for the full year. I know you have the 2 extra days in the fourth quarter. You mentioned commodities were easing. Anything else about the timing of expenses in the fourth quarter versus year-to-date, as well as what you're lapping in the fourth quarter that'll explain the strength? I know last year's fourth quarter was strange, you had some of the timing differences related to the CCE transaction. So I don't know if that's also coming into play in the lap there.\nMuhtar Kent: Bill, this is Muhtar. Let me just address a few of the things in your question, and then Gary will add some more commentary. First, I want to just ensure and stress that our business momentum continues in the midst of ongoing global economic challenges. Our system is very well aligned and on track to achieve our 2020 Vision. And the appetite for investment by our bottling partners is strong as it has ever been. And consumers' love for our brands is stronger than ever. And as such, we do remain confident in our ability to meet our long-term targets, while also delivering sustainable, profitable growth and value for our shareowners. With respect -- and so -- at the outset. With respect to your question on the fourth quarter, let me -- as Gary said, we -- based on what we know today, we feel very confident that we can dock our ship for 2012, in line with our long-term growth targets for both top line and bottom in terms of operating profit. And so as Gary mentioned, that will imply having a double-digit growth in our operating income for the fourth quarter. We feel confident that, that can be achieved based on what we know and based on current trends. And that is a host of reasons; cycling of marketing expenses, as you saw total marketing for the company was up quite significantly in the fourth quarter. We had spend related to -- a onetime spend related to the Olympics, to the UEFA Cup, spending on our brands in a healthy way. And I think it is important to note that you can find many companies today around the world, around -- in the United States, around the world that can generate their profit line from no growth in top line. That is not sustainable. We feel very confident that we're doing the right thing for our business, right thing for our brand and we will dock our ship in 2012, yet again, in line with our long-term growth target, despite having -- facing significant commodity headwinds in both 2011 and cycling also on top of that, headwinds in 2012, investing in our brands, growing our top line and also earning our price/mix. So I'd like to just emphasize that, and pass it over to Gary.\nGary P. Fayard: Okay. Bill, a couple of things. As you mentioned, the 2 extra days helped significantly, most particularly in the finished products business, so both in North America and in BIG. And we saw the opposite impact of the 1 less day in the first quarter. So the 2 extra days helped significantly. There are quite a bit of cycling things. And you see a lot of that cycling in the third quarter, which made the third quarter so complex, and that's why we try to give a lot of extra guidance at the end of the second quarter because of the third. But a lot of that is what we've been saying all year, particularly about the North America business, how we would expect to see sequential improvement in the North America business. If you remember, just it went from minus 9 to even, now to plus 3, and you'll continue to see improvement in North America. The easing of commodities is -- obviously is helping some, although a lot of that commodity now has come through, the easing has come through into the standard costs, but that's helping. And currency will help as well, in that the headwinds of currency from the minus 7 in the third quarter to lower in the fourth quarter, not just on the translation of the results but the transactional impact, particularly inside of BIG where that currency owned -- the cost of their commodities or in their cost of goods, we do not pull out our currency-neutral calculation. So the impact of currency does hurt BIG results, and so that will improve as well in the fourth quarter. So I think everything we're seeing -- the brands are healthy. We've taken pricing across the world, we've seen much better elasticities than what we've ever had historically, which give -- has given us a lot of optimism as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.\nJudy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just in terms of North America, so it's nice to see the profitability of slight positively in the quarter. If you could just maybe talk about as you look 2013, your ability to sort of sustain kind of a positive pricing mix. And also just color as it relates to some of the commentary on channel mix that you've alluded to in the last quarter where you continue to see that pressure in terms of shift towards take home versus immediate consumption and how that's kind of playing out so far.\nMuhtar Kent: Sure. Judy, let me address some of those. I'm very pleased with the performance of our United -- U.S. business. I think in terms of -- we've increased total beverage volume and value share in this past quarter once again, driven by the 2% overall volume growth, led by 7% growth in still beverages, while -- and also maintaining sparkling volume on a year-to-date basis. And this is, again, 10th quarter in a row of volume growth in our North America business. And I think we continue to build our occasion-based price, pack, channel strategy that provides increased consumer choice, along with preferred packages, preferred price points, which is very important in this economic environment. We see also some more positive trends in the channel mix compared to last quarter. I think the overall convenience retail channel in the third quarter was stronger. Industry grew almost -- certainly above 4%, almost 5%. And we have not only taken significant pricing, 3% price/mix, up again in the quarter and maintained it for the full year, but also we are focused very much on transactions getting pricing, maintaining share and growing transactions in the United States. That's the model. That's working. And specifically, we've got a great package in the 12.5 ounce, which is retailing for under $1 in that channel, for example. And then also, we continue to expand in our food service channel with our innovative Freestyle. We will pass, for the first time this year the 10,000 mark in terms of dispensers deployed in this coming quarter, in the quarter that we're in, the fourth quarter. The average incidence lift there is more than 6%, the volume lift is significant, as well as revenue lift for the customer. So that's another very important point of reference in our business in the United States. And again our growth is led by strong performance with Coke Zero, up almost double digits in this past quarter, coming back very strongly, strong performance across multiple categories, such as POWERADE continuing, Gold Peak growing strong double digits, Fuze growing, smartwater, glac\u00e9au, Minute Maid, all growing in a very significant manner. So we feel confident that our North America strategies are working. We are focused on execution. We can always improve and strive for more, we always do. And we're optimistic about our outlook, despite the challenging competitive and macroeconomic backdrop. But important channels, we see better light coming through in some of the really important critical channels in the third quarter. I hope that's helpful.\nGary P. Fayard: Judy, it's Gary. On your -- the rest of your question, in 2013, we're going through business plans now. And on the year-end call, we'll give you an outlook on what we see, both for North America and rest of world, as well as -- because that will obviously encompass things like commodities, currencies, et cetera. So we'll go through that at the end of the year. And -- but we can't do it today.\nMuhtar Kent: And again, just to close the question, we feel confident about sequential improvement in this year and the fourth quarter in the U.S. business in terms of results. And again, we feel that the strategies that we've deployed are working in the United States. We have invested. Our total marketing, again, in the United States in the quarter, and this past quarter is up. And also I would say to you that we feel that specifically also that the packaging strategies are working really well for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.\nBryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just have a question regarding productivity in the productivity and reinvestment program. I guess one is just, Gary, if you could give us some idea of how much productivity is contributing to this year and kind of where you stand in terms of the 2015 target. And then, Muhtar, I think in your comments you talked about the new reporting lines and how that would help enable leveraging synergies. And so I just wanted to see if you could tie that comment back to the productivity and reinvestment program. Does it -- do the new reporting -- does the new reporting structure accelerate it? Does it increase, enhance it in some way? Just trying to get a sense of kind of where we stand on productivity.\nGary P. Fayard: Yes. Bryan, thanks. This is Gary. On the program just to remind everyone, what we announced earlier this year is a new productivity and reinvestment program from 2012 through 2015. And $550 million to $650 million composed of quite a few different focus areas. And we would take all of the productivity that we realize, and then take that and reinvest it back behind -- into the brands. We have started. We're well on the way. In fact, I can tell you that I have a sightline today to where we can achieve the entire target, so it's not an issue at all on achieving. Relative to the current year, I would say it's probably in the $40 million to $50 million range that's already been achieved and reflected in the results or will be in this year. So it's already flowing through. And we're doing, I think, really well. Just to remind everyone, the focus areas were around supply chain optimization, around marketing and innovation effectiveness, around operational excellence, which leads to OpEx leverage and around standardizing data and IT systems, where places where you can really get a lot of leverage, and then take that and reinvest it behind the brands. Muhtar?\nMuhtar Kent: Yes. And again, Bryan, in terms of the structure, I think we have a new leadership structure that is going to be leaner, more effective, more flexible structure; and that is going to drive a further, I believe, enhancement in our productivity initiatives. Gary and Ahmet Bozer and Irial and Steve and myself will be -- in terms of looking at these productivity initiatives, feel confident. And as Gary can see the -- have sight in the numbers and in the productivity being achieved, I think that we will certainly be looking at what we can do to enhance it even further. As you know, we came in, in the last productivity cycle for the past 3 years significantly over our targets, and we feel that we have again room to improve always. And also, as Gary said, importantly, while we deliver our results, this allows us to continue to invest successfully and making our brands even stronger. That is the key, and that's what you should always be looking for and that's what we always look for.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.\nWilliam Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Can you just sort of circle the square for me here? So you had great organic growth in both Latin America and Eurasia with terrific price and mix. But those are the 2 regions where you had the biggest margin compression. So is that really just sort of year-over-year comparisons and maybe some of the FX transaction here? Because you would have thought that with that kind of growth, perhaps the margins would have been a little bit better.\nMuhtar Kent: Just very quickly on that. I'll tell you, first, we had very significant marketing spend in our international operations and total company for the third quarter. Our total marketing was up double digits for our international operations. And I think that again, that is partly cycling from prior year, particularly in certain geographic areas. But also it was to do with the onetime spend related to the Olympics, related to brand building around the UEFA Cup, particularly for Europe, but also for Eurasia, as well as for Latin America. So I think you need to take it into that context, from the perspective of marketing spend, cycling and prior year comparisons. And I'll see if Gary wants to add anything to that.\nGary P. Fayard: Yes, one thing I would add, and I don't know if this is directly responsive to your question, but when I made a few comments in the prepared remarks about volume and how we have different business models like the Innocent, Aujan, et cetera. So you've got some volume in Eurasia this quarter, for example. So if you look at the table in the release, if I remember correctly, it would show that Eurasia and Africa's volume, volumes up 11% and comparable currency-neutral operating income is up 11% as well. So you're not seeing a lot of leverage in that. If you -- but remember, there is no income in there related to Aujan. It's sitting down in equity income, but the volume is in that 11%. So if you adjust for that, Eurasia, Africa actually has some really nice operating leverage within their P&L. And so on operating margins, they're actually sitting in a really nice place for the quarter and year-to-date. So and then on Latin America, I don't think anything really unusual at all. I think they just continue to hum along as they have for the last number of years. And there's nothing other than we continue to invest in Latin America because it's such a great, great, strong market.\nMuhtar Kent: One other thing about Latin America, just want to add context is in the -- a couple of years ago, we had this discussion. And many were questioning Latin America's ability to continue grow. And I always said, \"Latin America is just beginning its journey in still beverages.\" The key is to have balanced growth. Still beverages, though, growing, of course, from a very small base at a higher rate of growth than sparkling beverages. But I think there's -- Latin America is a great model for how we can continue to grow at even high per capita as for sparkling beverages entering into new categories. And I think that is adding tremendous value to our business and also tremendous strength to our bottom line as we continue to progress in Latin America. We're cycling a very strong quarter from Latin America last year and we still achieved 5% and generating very healthy returns.\nGary P. Fayard: Yes. The only \u2013I'd add one other thing as well. We're probably starting to give you too much detail. But within the quarter in Latin America -- in Brazil actually, they started making -- we started making our initial investments around the 2014 World Cup. That's in marketing. And while in absolute dollars it's not that big, it will continue. But in fact, it does have an impact of 1 point or 2 points on the leverage that you're seeing in Latin America. So I guess, all in, what we're saying is we are continuing to invest in the brands. We're investing well ahead of the curve. We're getting ready for 2014 World Cup. It's flowing through in the third quarter. And you'll see it flow-through next quarter as well because we're going to make sure that we do these things right.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.\nJohn A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: In taking a look at the price/mix number, obviously didn't come in as strongly as we've anticipated in Europe and the Pacific. Can you talk a little bit about what's driving those price/mix numbers and sort of how you see that playing out over the next couple of quarters?\nGary P. Fayard: Yes. Thanks, John. Let's go to Europe first. And there, I think, price/mix was negative 4, and there are a couple of things going on there. But I'd say it's primarily actually the economic condition of Europe. And we've been seeing this flow through for some time now. So I think it's kind of the new normal until we start seeing some more favorable results. But what you're seeing is go to Madrid and what you -- and look at the cafes, and there aren't a lot of people sitting around drinking cokes or coffee or whatever. It is a shift in consumer spending in Europe from immediate consumption much more to future consumption. So while we grew our volume across the region or across each of the business units, there is a shift, and it's all about the macroeconomic environment that we're dealing with. So we feel very confident because people continue to love the brands. They continue to buy the brands. They are just buying them in more of a take home because they're not going out. So it's the macros that are impacting that. And additionally, if you look at the growth rates, there's negative geographic price/mix in Europe as well, just look at the growth rates. Europe and Central and Southern Europe grew faster than Spain and Northwest Europe. So that's some of it as well. And we're cycling through the tax increase in France. So it's all of those kinds of things together. Don't expect to see it get worse. I think we're kind of at the bottom now and should be okay. Relative to price/mix in the Pacific, I think your initial reaction would probably be, \"Oh my God, it's minus 6.\" And your initial reaction is probably that it's all China. Well, it's not actually. A lot of it is actually because if you look at cases and gallons while, as I said in the prepared remarks, that gallons are slightly about 0.5 point ahead of cases in the quarter, in Japan, where Japan volume was up 2, gallons were actually down 2. And it's normal and it'll be fine at the end of the year. But that's 4-point swing in Japan, which as a very high profit per gallon market causes significant price/mix, negative price/mix, and that's a large part of what we're seeing in the Pacific. It's not a big deal. I think Japan was, I think, pretty much in line year-to-date and will be full year.\nJohn A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it, that's great. And then if I can just ask a follow-up on the -- particularly on the Spain piece of this, which is are you guys running on a straight incidence pricing model then in Spain? Because that negative channel mix would probably -- I'm trying to figure out how that's impacting you so quickly unless you're providing either a, you're on a straight incidence, in which case the channel mix would hit you immediately? Or are you providing a little extra funding into the bottlers in terms of trying to help them get through this?\nMuhtar Kent: John, the primary reason, I'd say probably 70% -- this is Muhtar, 70% of the mix in Europe is geographic, related to the fact that lower price regions like Germany and Eastern Europe and Central Europe were growing faster than some of the other regions in Europe that have a higher pricing like France, like England, and that has really -- and like Spain. Spain has one of the highest prices in Europe. And so that has had the biggest contributing factor. One of the reasons for that was very unseasonable weather in Northern Europe during half of the quarter. It's never been wetter than -- in history than this \u2013 than the beginning of the quarter for 2.5 -- 2 months, 1.5 months, half of the quarter in Northern Europe. So that is coming back, and we feel that, that is one of the primary reasons. As we have more balanced growth in Europe, which we expect will happen, and as Gary said, we feel that it's not going to get any worse than it is and it may even -- and even in these conditions, we can generate growth and crack the calculus for growth, then we feel that, that will certainly be coming back quite significantly. Spain remains today, on a net revenue per unit case basis, the highest in Europe. So I just want to make sure that those -- that commentary gets through.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Caroline Levy from CLSA.\nCaroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Obviously, my concern is definitely around China. And just I'm just wondering how margins in the Pacific would not be impacted by what's happening in China. Can you just dig a little deeper? Was there -- did you have increased promotional activity in China during the quarter? Or should we expect that in the next period? Just as we know the competitive environment there has got more -- both more price competitive and there's more distribution for Pepsi brands there.\nMuhtar Kent: Well firstly, I mean I think, Caroline, on China, we are confident in our ability to continue growing in China, in this important market despite the changing, as you mentioned, competitive landscape and softness -- comparative softness in the macro conditions. And our transactions are up a healthy 7% in the past quarter. We have said it before in previous quarters that we're focused on transactions and that's the health of the business in China. And certainly, we're driving transactions in a very favorable way. Year-to-date, volume is a solid 6% and our brands are very strong. We have a clear leadership position in the sparkling category, and I have total confidence in both our bottling partners, COFCO and Swire beverages and Bottling Investment Group were to continue to deliver. You have noted from previous calls that on a total comparative basis, relative basis, China's contribution to profit is less than its contribution to volume in the Pacific Group for a number of reasons. One is because we've got much more developed countries that have much bigger margins for like, of course, Japan, but like also Australasia. And therefore, it is -- the impact -- even if we were to promote in China and not that, again, we feel it's a rational environment. But even if we were to promote, it would not have significant impact on the results of the Pacific Group, simply because of the size and scale of the profit pools that are generated out of markets like Japan and out of markets like Australasia. And again, given the size of our Japan profit pool in the Pacific Group, what Gary mentioned is the primary cause of that, which is an increase in volume, 2%, but a commensurate decrease at the same percent point in actually concentrate shipments.\nOperator: Our final question today comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Muhtar, I was hoping we could talk a little bit more about North America c-stores, and I had 2 questions there. Firstly, on the sparkling part of your portfolio, can you give us a little more detail on what's going on with some of the smaller pack sizes? I think they were having some difficulty in the second quarter. What's happening there? And also within sparkling in c-stores competing products, with Mountain Dew spending a lot more, what's your strategy versus that particular brand with your portfolio? So that's on the sparkling side. And then can you just give us an update on the energy segment sequentially in c-stores?\nMuhtar Kent: Yes, I think in terms of -- firstly, the good news is that there is more positives to talk about the c-store channel in the quarter than in the first half of the year, we feel. And certainly, it is also important to note that we aggressively led the industry on competition and pricing in the channel. And also that the industry grew at around just under -- shy of 5% roughly in the channel. And we led the pricing. And we have, again, very healthy growth in transactions. And we held share in the channel and of course in total market. And in terms of packaging, our variety of packages starting with the entry pack of 12.5 ounce is really working well for us at the entry price of under $1. And then that puts us -- our 16 ounce significantly ahead of competition and pricing at $1.19 and so on and so forth. So I would say we are very confident and very pleased with the progress that we have in that channel as we have in the Foodservice channel where we see increased traffic coming through, particularly in the latter part of the quarter. And then in energy, you asked, we had double-digit volume growth. Our brands were up and gained volume and value share in the energy channel, in -- which is primarily the c-store, the convenient store channel. But also I'd say that our variety of packages, including the mini cans, 8.5 ounce mini cans and all the way through the 1.25 liter combined with the 2-liter, et cetera, are working really well for us in the future consumption channel as well.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So it sounds like Mountain Dew -- of all the things competitively happening in c-stores, Mountain Dew is not, on the margin, a big impact on your business, at least for now?\nMuhtar Kent: I wouldn't want to comment on competition. I just would say that I think it's healthy for everyone. So thank you Gary and Jackson. And in closing, we had a strong third quarter, have again delivered quality year-to-date performance results. Our business continues to grow even in the midst of global economic challenges. Our system is clearly aligned, on track to achieve our 2020 Vision. The appetite for investment by our bottling partners is as strong as it's ever been. And together we, as a system, continue to invest in our brands on a global scale through world-class marketing and also through world-class commercial strategies. And as a result, consumers' love for our brands is stronger than ever. As always, we thank you for your interest and your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference. Thank you so much for joining.

Please look at our website for this information. Now I'll turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date results. We're delivering consistent top line performance in line with our 2020 Vision and long-term growth targets despite an increasingly unpredictable global economy. Our business realized solid top line results this past quarter, growing worldwide volume by 4% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date. Our second quarter comparable currency neutral net revenue was up 7% in the quarter, driven by solid price mix of 3%. Year-to-date, comparable currency neutral net revenue was also up 7% and our comparable currency neutral operating income also grew 7% in the quarter, raising our year-to-date operating income growth to 6%. We once again led industry growth, extending our volume and value share gains globally in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. We gained global share in the sparkling beverage category, where our portfolio is now up 3% year-to-date. This was driven by the global growth of brand Coca-Cola, which is also up a healthy 3% year-to-date. We gained global share in the still beverages category, where our portfolio grew a solid 9% in both the quarter as well as year-to-date. Importantly, we delivered these results while further enhancing the well-being of the communities and customers we proudly serve and the consumers whose lives we touch each and every day. During today's call as we discuss our performance, I'll also share a few of the meaningful ways we are serving our communities across our geographic operations, as these efforts are an integral part of realizing and sustaining our 2020 Vision. We recognize that consumers across the globe continue to feel the effects and impacts of prolonged uncertainty in Europe, the further cooling of the economy in China and a protracted recovery here in the United States. Despite this, our consistent quality performance results, as well as our systems commitment to invest in the business for long-term growth, give us confidence that we have the right strategies and the right plans in place to deliver full year 2012 results that meet our long-term growth targets, for in times like these, there is no better industry to be in than the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry. We're proud to be part of a strong and growing industry that passionately serves millions of outlets and refreshes billions of consumers every single day. Now let us review our performance results across our global markets in more detail, beginning with our flagship market, North America, where this past quarter, our business delivered its ninth consecutive quarter of growth, up 1% for both the quarter as well as year-to-date. Importantly, we achieved this growth in North America while sustaining a positive 3% price mix for our total beverage business. And in the process, we once again captured value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages this quarter, consistent with our focus on driving profitable growth in North America. This growth was led by our still beverage portfolio, which was up 8% this quarter, gaining both volume and value share across nearly all of the categories in which we compete. In sports drinks, POWERADE once again grew double-digits this quarter, while also capturing volume and value share. This marks the third consecutive quarter in which POWERADE has led the North America sports drink category in absolute unit case volume growth. Our glac\u00e9au brands, up 5% this quarter, also captured share, driven by the further momentum of vitaminwater zero, up high single-digits, as well as by another quarter of double-digit growth for smartwater. In addition, smartwater began using PlantBottle packaging this past May, as we further leverage this proprietary, innovative and sustainable packaging that we launched nationally with our DASANI water brand last year. Speaking of DASANI, this brand provided yet another quarter of double-digit growth in North America, delivering both volume and value share gains. The acceleration of our tea portfolio in North America also continued this quarter, up double-digits while gaining both volume and value share. This result was led by Gold Peak, which has now grown double-digits for 21 consecutive quarters. Finally, our juice and juice drink portfolio in North America was up 3%, led by high single-digit growth for our Simply brands, as well as mid-single-digit growth for our Minute Maid brands. These results solidify our share leadership in the high-value, 100% chilled orange juice segment. Our sparkling beverages in North America was down 2% in our second quarter, in line with the broader sparkling beverage industry's results during the same April to June time frame. Importantly, our sparkling beverage portfolio earned a positive 5% price mix this quarter in a rational pricing environment. We also sustained our momentum behind both Coke Zero and Fanta, with both these brands up mid-single-digits this quarter. We're particularly pleased to see this continued solid growth for Coke Zero in North America, considering that this brand's baseline was built off of 5 consecutive years of double-digit growth. This winning track record reflects our commitment to sustainable innovation that delivers year-over-year growth. And Coca-Cola's brand equity scores keep improving, with Coca-Cola's favorite brand score among the total U.S. population up when compared to a year ago. This favorite brand score for Coca-Cola is now nearly 2x greater than the score of its primary competitor. Finally, our Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispenser, which recently won the Gold Innovation Award from the National Automatic Merchandising Association, is now available in more than 4,400 outlets across North America. One of the many ways we've consistently served our communities in North America is through our investments in initiatives that promote physical activity and well-being. A good example is how we are encouraging physical activity through our Sprite Spark Parks Project. Launched in 2011, this project has supported the construction and refurbishment of more than 150 neighborhood parks, athletic fields and basketball courts. We're also partnering with the National Foundation for Governors' Fitness Councils and the American College of Sports Medicine to build gyms in schools across the country. Last month, we announced that we will dedicate $5 million to provide 100 communities with new fitness centers for schools. While our commitment to our communities both in North America, as well as across the globe, goes well beyond just physical activity programs, we will always encourage our consumers to be healthy and active and provide them with opportunities to do so. This is at the heart of our brand values. In summary, we have every reason to remain optimistic about the long-term outlook for this market, which has the best demographics of the developed world and remains an unparalleled center of innovation and entrepreneurial activity. Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which grew 8% in both the quarter and year-to-date, including 6% year-to-date growth for brand Coca-Cola. Additionally, our Pacific Group captured both volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages this quarter. During our last earnings call, we shared our expectations that our volume growth in China might moderate to some extent as our business would not be immune to China's cooling economy. In fact, China's GDP growth rate is at a 3-year low, yet still above 7%. As anticipated, the broader beverage industry in China has felt the impact of this economic slowdown. Despite this, our business in China delivered 7% growth in the second quarter, while cycling a strong 21% growth from last year. Year-to-date growth in China was a solid 8%, cycling 17% from last year. The rightsized packaging efforts we put in place in China last year keep generating consistent, strong incremental transactions, in line with our expectations. As such, both sparkling beverage and total beverage transactions were up double-digits for both the quarter as well as year-to-date in China. And importantly, we once again captured both volume and value share in the sparkling category -- beverage category in China this past quarter. We're very excited about our opportunities in this region. Our clear focus on building our business for sustainable growth provides us with confidence that China will continue to serve as a double-digit growth market over the long term. Our business in Japan delivered yet another quarter of strong growth, with volume up 4%, bringing our year-to-date growth in this important critical market to up to 4% as well on a year-to-date basis. Importantly, these results in Japan were broad-based, with growth seen across all channels, including convenience stores as well as vending. And our Japan business gained both volume and value share in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage category this quarter. So looking ahead, we expect our third quarter volume results in Japan to moderate below our 4% year-to-date trend as we enter what is forecasted to be a cooler summer season when compared to last summer's historically record hot temperatures. Having said that, we remain confident that our system in Japan is well aligned and in a strong position to deliver full year low single-digit growth in 2012. I also want to update our results in Thailand. Our business in this market sustained its solid momentum, growing over 20% for both the quarter and year-to-date. In the process, we gained volume and value share in Thailand across nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as in both sparkling and still beverage categories. We are excited about the future growth opportunities in Thailand, and we'll keep investing for the future in this vibrant market. As for the Philippines, we just celebrated the 100th anniversary of our entry into this market. Importantly, we again captured volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages in the Philippines and have grown our volume mid-single-digits for both the quarter as well as year-to-date. We launched our 5 BY 20 program in the Philippines almost exactly 1 year ago. As background, this program is our global initiative to enable the economic empowerment of 5 million women entrepreneurs by 2012 -- 2020. In the Philippines, we are working with local partners to implement a pilot business skills training program, and we are now in the process of scaling up this program nationwide to economically empower 100,000 women store owners and operators by 2020. We believe there is no better investment we can make to spur economic growth and foster sustainable development. Moving now to Latin America. Our volume grew 3% for the quarter and is up 4% year-to-date. This growth was once again led by brand Coca-Cola, up 3% year-to-date. In the process, we once again captured both volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in Latin America, as well as share gains in both sparkling and still beverages. In Mexico, our volume growth in the quarter was up 1% as we cycled a very strong 10% growth from previous year. This brings our year-to-date volume growth in Mexico to 2%, while cycling 12% from last year. Importantly, we once again outperformed the beverage industry in Mexico, capturing nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share, as well as in sparkling and still beverages. In Brazil, our business continued to deliver solid results, with volume growth up 6% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date. And our business in Brazil is also driving industry growth, gaining both volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages, as well as again in sparkling and still beverages. Looking ahead, we expect our 2012 growth results in Brazil to hold steady at low to single -- low to mid-single-digits, especially in light of recent revisions to the Brazilian economy's GDP forecast for the remainder of this year. Our Eurasia & Africa business extended its momentum, growing a strong 12% in the quarter and 11% year-to-date, including solid 11% year-to-date growth for brand Coca-Cola. This group's overall performance was once again led by India, which grew a strong 20% for both the quarter and year-to-date, delivering balanced and consistent growth across all beverage categories. Sparkling beverage growth in India was led by brand Coca-Cola, up 35% in the quarter and 32% year-to-date. In still beverages in India, our Maaza juice brand was up over 30% in both quarter and year-to-date. And importantly, our business in India captured volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages and also in both sparkling and still beverages. I was recently in India, where we announced our systems plan to increase investments in India by $3 billion, bringing total system investments to $5 billion between now and 2020. These investments will drive innovation and enable our efforts to deliver a portfolio that enhances the consumer experience and builds brand loyalty to deliver long-term sustainable growth. Russia was up 9% this quarter, raising our year-to-date growth to 7%. The steady acceleration of our business in Russia was once again led by the strong momentum of brand Coca-Cola, which grew 23% in the quarter and is now up 22% year-to-date. Similarly, strong results were also observed across our broader sparkling portfolio as Fanta and Sprite both registered double-digit growth this past quarter in Russia. And our Dobriy juice brand delivered 12% growth in the quarter, bringing this brand's year-to-date results to double digits. As a result, our overall business in Russia keeps outperforming the rest of the industry, gaining nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share. We also saw robust growth across the rest of Eurasia & Africa region this quarter, including double-digit growth in South Africa and the Middle East, as well as North Africa region. Lastly, we finalized our acquisition of approximately half the equity of Aujan Industries this past quarter. As a reminder, Aujan holds the #1 position in the still beverage business across the entire Middle East. Between our solid performance, the strength of our bottling partners and our new partnership with Aujan, it is easy to see why we are so excited about the future of our business in this dynamic part of the world. Moving now to Europe, where our volume was down 4% for the quarter, cycling strong 5% growth from last year. As a result, our business in Europe is now down 2% on a year-to-date basis, cycling 3% growth from prior year. This past quarter, Europe was challenged by both historically unseasonable inclement weather as well as ongoing macro uncertainties. Despite this, our business in Europe held share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as sparkling beverages, while capturing both volume and value share in still beverages. Germany remains the bright spot in this region, up 1% for the quarter and 2% on a year-to-date basis. This marks Germany's sixth consecutive quarter of positive growth. Importantly, we once again captured volume and value share in ready-to-drink beverages. This serves as a solid evidence that we have the right brands, the right strategies and the right capabilities in place to deliver long-term sustainable growth in this critically important market. We recently concluded our highly successful activation of the UEFA Euro 2012 football tournament. In recent consumer surveys, Coca-Cola was overwhelmingly recognized as the tournament's primary brand sponsor, with this brand awareness translating into volume and value share gains in the tournament's host nations. We're also very excited about the special opportunity to grow the value of our brands even further through our investment in the 2012 London Summer Olympics. From a brand standpoint, we shared our last quarter -- we shared last quarter how our Olympics Move to the Beat program has been launched globally and activated in over 100 markets. Additionally to brand Coca-Cola, we're leveraging this unique platform to activate and fully integrate a global Olympic POWERADE program in more than 35 markets across -- all across the world. This will be POWERADE's first global activation program since its launch 20 years ago at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games. And in keeping with our LIVE POSITIVELY culture, we've placed our commitment to sustainable communities at the heart of our Olympic activation efforts. This year, we're offering the widest range of drinks and sizes ever to be made available at the Olympic Games, and we have pledged that all bottles collected at the Olympic Games venues will be recycled and back on shelves within a short 6 weeks. We have also updated the labels for our Coca-Cola packages to present consumers with a clear recycling call to action. And we've also created more than 120 permanent Coca-Cola Recycle Zones all across Great Britain. Before closing, let me say how pleased we are with this past quarter when Coca-Cola was recognized as the #1 brand by CoreBrand, based on a survey tracking the corporate brands of 1,000 companies across 54 industries. This is the 11th straight year we have received this honor, is especially gratifying since CoreBrand's rankings are based on a poll of 10,000 business professionals with rankings based on brand familiarity, reputation, perception of management, as well as investment potential. While all of us at The Coca-Cola Company are proud of our performance year-to-date, we believe that our best days are still ahead. Our 2020 Vision provides our system with a clear road map for growth. Our consistent quality volume, value and profit results demonstrate that our global bottling system is very well-aligned and poised for execution. As we look ahead for the balance of this year, we understand that consumers still face an unpredictable environment. Having said that, we remain confident that we have the well-loved brands, vision and road map with our global bottling partners to effectively navigate today's environment. We will continue to passionately refresh a thirsty world. We will do so by offering a growing choice of quality beverages that refresh and hydrate our consumers while bringing them simple moments of happiness. We will do so by sustaining our commitments to communities and to the many well-being initiatives we support. And we will do so by ensuring that we always place our highest priority on creating sustainable value for our consumers, for our customers and for our shareholders. With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary.\nGary P. Fayard: Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid results this quarter, demonstrating once again that despite an unpredictable environment, our global system is well positioned to execute our strategic plans in alignment with our 2020 Vision. Let me start with our comparable earnings per share, which came in at $1.22 this quarter, up 4% versus the prior year. This raises our year-to-date comparable earnings per share growth to 4% as well. Our comparable currency neutral operating income was up 7% this quarter, increasing our year-to-date comparable currency neutral operating income to 6%. On a comparable basis, the impact of currency on this quarter's operating income results was a 5% headwind. Comparable currency neutral net revenues grew 7% this quarter, including a 3% increase in concentrate sales and a 3% positive price mix. The currency impact from this quarter's comparable net revenue results was a 4% headwind. On a year-to-date basis, our comparable currency neutral net revenue growth held steady at 7%. We also maintained our consolidated price mix at a positive 3% this quarter. In fact, we realized positive price mix across every one of our geographic operating groups this quarter. Looking ahead, we will cycle higher price mix comparisons during the back half of 2012, which will lead to lower consolidated price mix results in the third and fourth quarters. Having said that, we continue to expect our full year 2012 consolidated price mix results to come in between 1% and 2%, in line with our long-term target range. Our gross margins softened a little further this past quarter, particularly in late May and June. This sequential trend is being driven by both ongoing currency headwinds, as well as by changing -- changes in channel and package mix across markets, as today's economic conditions are leading consumers to temporarily shift their channel and package preferences. As we look ahead, we anticipate that these currency and mix shift headwinds will continue through 2012. As such, we now expect our full year 2012 comparable gross margin to come in below our second quarter gross margin, with this headwind primarily observed in the third quarter of 2012. Despite this, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year comparable currency neutral operating income growth in line with our long-term growth targets. Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were up 5% in both the quarter and year-to-date. These results include an overall increase in year-to-date direct marketing expenses, as we sustain our commitment to invest in the health and the strength of our brands. Our operating expense leverage once again came in positive this quarter, bringing our year-to-date operating expense leverage up to 1 point, in line with our previously stated outlook. We now expect our third quarter operating expense leverage to range between a negative 3 and negative 5 points. However, this pressure on operating expense leverage is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter, especially as we benefit from having 2 additional selling days in the fourth quarter, and enabling us to achieve slightly positive operating expense leverage on a full year basis. Our net interest came in even in the second quarter, exactly in line with the outlook we provided in our last earnings call. This held our year-to-date net interest income at $27 million. We now expect our net interest to come in as a slight expense in the back half of the year, primarily due to expected lower rates in some of our international locations, as well as ongoing currency headwinds. As a result, we are now updating our full year net interest income outlook to $10 million to $20 million, with the net interest expense we sense -- that we see in the second half of 2012 evenly spread between the third and fourth quarter. Our underlying effective tax rate now stands at 24%, which is an improvement over the 24.8% rate we communicated during our last earnings call. And we expect to be able to carry this 24% tax rate through the remainder of this year and into next year. And our cash flow from operations increased a very strong 15% year-to-date. Our year-to-date net share repurchases total $1.6 billion. This places us well on track to achieve the $2.5-billion to $3-billion range for full year 2012 that we communicated at the outset of this year. With regard to commodities, in our last call, we said we expected the full year 2012 incremental impact of our big 4 commodity cost on our results to range between $350 million and $450 million. We also said that if current trends held, we could see this outlook slowly improve. Today, I can confirm, based on our latest forecast, we now expect our full year incremental cost on commodities to come in closer to $300 million. As for currencies, we previously provided an outlook that they would have a mid-single-digit negative impact on our full year operating income. Today, we are still seeing the dollar strengthen against other currencies, including many of those that we do not traditionally hedge, that is not effect -- because it's not effective to do so due to the high cost associated with these hedges. As such and based on our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we expect currencies to have an 8% to 9% negative impact on operating income in the third quarter. In addition, we now expect the full year impact of currencies on our operating income to be a headwind at the high end of the previously communicated mid-single-digit range. And there's one housekeeping item to keep in mind as you update your models. Our shareowners recently approved a 2-for-1 stock split, which will double the number of outstanding shares in August. In closing, as we reach this halfway point of 2012, we find ourselves navigating through a challenging global economy. The recovery in the United States remains moderate and consumer sentiment is still challenged. Consumers in Europe are feeling the effects of that region's prolonged macroeconomic uncertainty. And the economy in China, while still growing, continues to demonstrate signs of cooling. But it's important to put today's challenges and our business results in the proper perspective, for while consumers may be feeling some pressure in these markets, we continue to execute with excellence. We are earning price and gaining value share in North America while sequentially improving profitability. We're holding our share in Europe while investing in our brands for long-term growth. And we're delivering double-digit transactions growth in China as we solidify our leadership across multiple categories in this growing market. The bottom line is that we are successfully managing our business for the long-term while delivering consistent and solid top line and bottom line results. Our system is healthy and is financially strong as ever, generating solid cash flow and investing to support our world-class portfolio of brands. We are also investing across the globe to support the long-term health and well-being of our communities, customers and consumers. And importantly, we continue to reward our shareowners, prudently managing our investments to deliver quality results while also paying a healthy dividend. So as we look ahead to the rest of 2012 and a protracted and unpredictable economic recovery, we are encouraged by our consistent results, as well as by our faith in our 2020 Vision, and remain confident in our ability to deliver full year volume, revenue and operating income results in line with our long-term growth targets. Operator, we're now ready for the questions, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Bill Pecoriello, Consumer Edge Research.\nWilliam Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: Muhtar, considering the tough global macroeconomic backdrop, your Q2 results were certainly impressive. But you've been talking about on the call today, some of the incremental global macro headwinds we're seeing decelerating further in certain markets, so what's giving you the confidence that The Coca-Cola Company can continue this strong performance during the second half of the year? And what specific actions is the company taking to offset the incremental headwinds? You mentioned some of the packaging shifting. And maybe is there any reallocation of market spending, et cetera?\nMuhtar Kent: I think I'd just say -- start by saying that, firstly, we're very fortunate that our business has been doing well in recent years. I think operating in this environment has become the norm for us. It's not a passing feature now, operating in this very volatile and unpredictable environment. And I think that we're meeting the long-term growth targets set out for our 2020 Vision, even in difficult economic circumstances. And I think part of our success has been because there's been a healthy appetite for investment across our global bottling system in this environment, and stronger than it's been for a long time. Our 2020 Vision is a system vision. It's focused on long-term growth collectively with our partners -- bottling partners. And when you look back at 2010, 2011, the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry grew by about $65 billion in total retail dollar value. And we're pleased to say that our system represented nearly 40% of that total industry growth, well above our fair share, underscoring that vision and that collective effort and that investment is working. That said, we're naturally keenly aware of how turbulent the economic landscape is today and will continue to be this year. And we've said many times before during the past few years that we may hit a bump in the road, given the continued volatility in the macro environment, but that we're focused on meeting our long-term growth targets on realizing -- and realizing our 2020 Vision. And so far, I think you can say that, quarter-after-quarter, we've proven that. All of us at Coca-Cola, the entire system, remain constructively discontent. We know that we can always do better. And I think you've got to realize we've got a wonderful portfolio of geographic regions. And so some of them may -- not all of them will not ever do well all the time. But just like this past quarter, where we had very unseasonable weather in Europe, we had tremendous, again, negative consumer sentiment brewing in Europe, we still have delivered our results and we will continue to do so. And then also, quarter-after-quarter, we're gaining share and, quarter-after-quarter, our business, our top brands have been improving. Brand health metrics, I keep on saying that's an important metric to look at. And when you look at the past sort of quarters, back to 2011 versus today, we've again delivered very strong increments of improvement in our Coke, Fanta, Sprite brand scores, as well as weekly-plus drinkers. And as you go around the world, I think certainly there is a sentiment that this is going to be a prolonged crisis, that the high levels of unemployment are here to stay, both in Europe as well as in the United States, and also that there's a little somewhat cooling off of economies in Asia, particularly China. But in this environment, I don't believe there's a better business and there is a better system to continue to crack the calculus for growth. When you look at BRICS, Brazil, Russia, India and China and the Sub-Saharan Africa, referred to as the BRICS nations, we grew in Q2 a combined plus 8%. And so it's worth noting that those markets represent nearly 400 million cases of incremental growth last year. And so we continue to generate significant growth in those emerging markets and we continue to create growth in developed markets, like Japan, what you saw in this past quarter, as well as the United States, ninth consecutive quarter of growth in the United States. And when we first talked about that, again, in the midst of economic turmoil back 2.5 years ago, very few people thought that we could achieve that. So that's why I have confidence, Bill, that we believe that we can continue to meet our long-term growth targets despite a very volatile, unpredictable and prolonged economic recovery.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMC.\nJohn A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Gary, I want to talk a little bit about the operating leverage guidance going forward, particularly for the third quarter. You talked a little bit about the gross margin impact. In order to get to that type of negative deleveraging, we'd probably have to see a little higher level of SG&A spending. So can you talk a little bit about that? And then also, can you talk about some of the improvement that you've started to show in North America in terms of operating profit growth there? With North America sort of -- I guess, the question is, are you expecting North America to also get better from here? Because if it does, that also makes the operating leverage in Q3 seem a little bit more surprising.\nGary P. Fayard: A very good question. And let me -- I'm going to have to take it in pieces and parts, if I could, and see if we can put that all that together and come up with an answer on it. But let's start at gross margin first, because I think that's the most important place to start. Even on gross margin, I think you've got to split it into a couple of pieces, split the company, look at BIG and international operations and then North America. And on BIG and international, a lot of the gross margin pressure there is really FX currency headwinds. And it's coming through in cost of sales, and there's an impact on revenue. And so that is causing some margin pressure. And the highest impact of exchange rates -- highest headwind impact of exchange rates on us this year will be in the third quarter. And then it starts moderating again on what we're cycling. So that's the first thing. The second thing, while we're on international, on margins particularly is our expectation, as we just said, is that in Japan, we think growth is going to moderate slightly from the very strong 4% that we've seen year-to-date in Japan. They're going to still have a very good year. But I think that will moderate and that will put -- that will be some margin compression on the total company. Then if you go to North America, I think, I'd say we've been very pleased. We've seen sequential improvement in North America from -- first quarter operating income was down 9, 10-ish. This quarter, it's even. And I think we'll continue to see sequential improvement, albeit kind of slow improvement, and I'll go into why, in North America. So in North America, I think what we're seeing and what we saw happen actually in the United States is in about mid-May, we started seeing consumer shifts and the consumer started changing behavior, we think temporarily. But I think it's just you pick up the newspaper, you turn on the television and you see economic -- huge economic issues all over the world, whether it's no job creation in the U.S. to all of the issues in Europe, China slowing somewhat. And what we then saw was the consumer change go more toward future consumption, packages and channels versus immediate consumption. And one of the things that's a little surprising -- and I think we'll have to see how this goes and I think it's, for sure, a temporary shift. But as the price of gasoline came down kind of in that May-June time period, normally what you would see, particularly in convenience retail, is your immediate consumption should go up, and it did not. So that, I think, is probably going to continue somewhat through the third quarter. Again, some margin pressure. So that's what's leading us to that gross margin and that's the primary part of it. We've got -- and then we were cycling some things last year relative to SG&A. So I think there will be some increase in SG&A, particularly in the third quarter, and that kind of cycles out in the fourth. So you put all that together, that's kind of where we get to on the negative 3 to 5 points of leverage in third quarter, coming back in the fourth quarter to positive -- slightly positive and kind of the gross margin as well. That was a long answer, but I think it's complicated because there are a lot of different parts to it.\nMuhtar Kent: And also, John, just one other point on what Gary mentioned in terms of the immediate consumption business. I think if you take our sort of top 22 countries in the world, in Q1, we had probably more than 15 of them realize very positive IC growth. In Q2, we had about 11 countries out of our sort of top 22 markets that had IC growth. And the primary reason for that was the very, very, very poor summer -- the start to the very poor summer in Europe. And so I think that is also an important factor that has to be kept in mind. It was a very unseasonable situation in Europe and hopefully, it will reverse itself in the coming months.\nJohn A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then, Gary, so is it safe to say that the leverage piece is transactional? So you're looking at transactional on the leverage piece and then the translational piece is separate. Is that kind of how we look at, at least internationally? Is that what you're telling us from an FX standpoint?\nGary P. Fayard: Say it in a different way to make sure I understand your question.\nJohn A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Well, I guess, in terms of there's transactional FX impacts as opposed to translational FX impacts, so is it the raw material increase in dollars in the local currencies that's driving the negative leverage from a BIG standpoint? Is that...\nGary P. Fayard: Yes, yes. So you've got translational impact on revenue, but then you've got transactional impact on cost of goods as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just wanted to follow up on John's question on operating leverage, just a couple of points of clarification. First, on the commodity cost increase expectation for the year of $300 million, how much has actually happened so far year-to-date?\nGary P. Fayard: This is Gary. I would say probably about half of it. I think it's going to be pretty well sequential through the year. And a lot of it we've already locked in and hedged. So it's pretty well, probably about half, maybe slightly less than half.\nBryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then in terms of the effect on gross margins of your outlook for price mix having less of a contribution in the first half of the year versus the second half, I just want to make sure it was clear that what you're -- this is just simply a phasing of the way your pricing -- your planned pricing rolled through the year. It's not an expectation or a change in plan in terms of being more promotional or promoting back at all for the second half. I was just trying to...\nGary P. Fayard: Yes. No, Bryan, it's exactly what you said. That's exactly right. It's what our normal pricing had been, what we're cycling just as we phase through the year. We are -- have not engaged in anything relative to change into more promotional or anything. It's normal pricing and normal cycling. In fact, if anything, I would tell you that the pricing environment has stayed -- particularly in the U.S., has stayed very rational. And some of our competitors internationally are doing a lot of promotional pricing. But that's kind of normal. What you're seeing is exactly what we plan to do the whole year, have not deviated at all.\nBryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then the last piece would just be in terms of understanding the different pieces on geographic mix. Europe is a high-margin market for you. And it sounds like, given the performance and just the outlook in terms of the macro, that you're expecting less of a contribution from Europe than you normally would expect. And now we're talking about profit contribution. So, a, is that the right way to think about it? And, b, or second, is there also anything that you're doing specifically in Europe to support profits while you've still got -- or to boost profitability while you've got kind of a soft patch from a demand perspective?\nGary P. Fayard: Yes. You're right on Europe. It is a high-margin, high-profitability business for us. And we're continuing to hold share. We are seeing some weakness there, obviously down 4% in the quarter. I think it's important to recognize that weather is probably as much to do with what we saw in the second quarter as the economic macros, probably 50-50 on all of Europe and probably even more so for Northwest Europe. Britain had the wettest summer so far that it's had in over the last 100 years. So the weather's been unbelievably bad. If it turns -- and I don't want to use weather as an excuse. If it turns, things will be better. We're not anticipating that, but hopefully that will be somewhat better. And we are cycling a pretty good summer from last year -- a very good summer from last year as well.\nMuhtar Kent: I think, Bryan, in Europe, we've got very, very strong programs in place. We've just finished one of the most successful euro activations. We have just embarking upon the Olympics programs, which globally are going to be activated in over 100 markets. We've never had that happen before. We've reached -- the greenest ever Olympics was -- we believe that our business is very strong in Europe. And as Gary said, I think there has been an anomaly in the weather. But having said that, if you look at the past -- in the last 2 years, Europe has really performed better than expectations, given how bad the consumer sentiment was deteriorating in Europe. And this should not be taken as a kind of a fall off the cliff. But certainly, Europe is continuing -- going to continue to be challenging as an environment. But our business gets essentially stronger in Europe because our brands are stronger. We're investing with our bottlers, both CCE, our Iberian bottlers, as well as Coca-Cola Hellenic. So I do believe that probably there was some factors, one-off factors that created the current result, as opposed to it being taken as a given for the rest. But I do also believe that I think you need to understand that we're in for a very protracted recovery in Europe.\nGary P. Fayard: Bryan, I'd add one thing. If you go back to our conference call in the first quarter, if you go back to the transcript, you asked a question on that call. And the last -- I think one of the last things I said to you in answering your question was, \"Remember, we are managing this business as a marathon and not a sprint.\" And that's exactly what you're hearing us say today. We're in a marathon. We're in this to win. We are gaining and furthering the distance between ourselves and our competitors every quarter. We're going to continue to do that. And we feel very good that we've got the right plans in place to do it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo.\nBonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I had a question on China. You talked about the volume in China slowing due to the economic slowdown. So I was hoping you could provide a little more color on some of the symptoms of a soft landing you're seeing in your business by some of your key categories, and then possibly by area or region. And then I also would be curious to hear how your business in China performed in the quarter compared to what your expectations were early on this quarter.\nMuhtar Kent: I think during our last earnings call, again, I think we shared our expectation that our volume growth in China might moderate to some extent as, a, the business is not going to be totally immune to the cooling, particularly along the coastal areas of China. And I think as anticipated, the broader beverage industry in China has also felt the impact of that slowdown in the first half of 2012. But also -- and so it was not -- in terms of expectations, it's probably where we expected the business to land in terms of how we saw the marketplace developing. I think, year-to-date growth in China being a solid 8%, cycling plus 17% from prior year, I believe we're content. But certainly, we'll always try to achieve double-digit growth. But importantly, I think the rightsizing packaging efforts that we put into place in China last year continued to generate consistent incremental transactions, in line with our expectations. In fact, a little bit ahead of our expectations. And as such, total beverage transactions -- and you've heard us talk about transactions being really a really very good metric for the health of the business -- were up double-digits for both the quarter, up about 12%, and also on a year-to-date basis, up about 14%. So just want to stress that, a really important point. And again, we captured both volume and value share significantly in the sparkling beverage category in China in this past quarter. And our brands, particularly in the sparkling category, have been doing very well. And transactions, as I say, which is a great health of the business, have been progressing well. In terms of regions, I think the northern regions and the regions -- more inland regions are doing a little better than the coastal regions in China. And I think we'll continue to see that throughout the year as some consumers have moved back into the central and inland regions of China, given some of the slowing down of the export businesses along the coast.\nBonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And then just a quick follow-on. Are you seeing any signs of slowdown in any other parts of Asia? Is this spreading in any way?\nMuhtar Kent: We are not. I would say Vietnam, Southeast Asia, Philippines is actually doing better. We talked about Philippines having a kind of coming off the cliff a little bit after the elections, and after tremendous amounts of sort of monetary easing preelections. I think it's coming back to a good sort of balance now. And then in terms of Indonesia, I think obviously, Australia, some of Australia's exports to China are slowing down. But actually, we've had a pretty good quarter in Australia. And I don't -- we don't really see -- it's actually a pretty strong, balanced growth across the region. I would phrase it that way, Bonnie.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: So maybe going back to the comment earlier about marathon versus sprint, sort of applying that again to North America and thinking about it from a long-term perspective. And obviously this quarter, you had pricing up 5%, volume down 2%. In share, it sounds like, in sparkling, roughly flat. Is that kind of a comfortable algorithm, a comfortable elasticity that you'd be looking for going forward, longer-term, sort of maybe moderating from price but kind of in that range of elasticity? Or does some of the macro challenges you're seeing now and maybe the persistence of those challenges make you think a little bit differently about that? And I guess, if you could answer that in the [indiscernible] of your margins, the margin answer you gave about North America going forward, that would be helpful.\nMuhtar Kent: Yes, Ali. First, let me just take sort of what we would term as sort of a normal outlook. I said it before. I think, look, in terms of moderate growth in volume in North America and we have -- and also certain amount of positive price mix, given the strength of our brands, I think, and also our new occasion channel-based packaging architecture that we've actually recreated with smaller packages with the mini cans, with the 14 ounces and with the advent also of a much wider Freestyle distribution of the Freestyle dispensing units, I think probably is the right way to think about. Given that it's going to be a protracted recovery, that's the way we would think about it. Moderate volume, 1% to 2%, and then also some positive price mix on top of that. And that's how we would see the business progressing. In terms of share, I think it's important to reflect on the fact that over the last 3 -- 2, 3 years, we've been gaining market share consistently quarter-after-quarter in the United States. If you look at consecutively, in terms of value share, since the beginning of 2010, every quarter, we've gained share if you look at the numbers in value share every quarter, adding on top of the quarter prior. So we've been coming through historically a very strong share gain environment. And I think certainly, we see the pricing environment to be logical and one that is rational, and that's very important. And I think we just have to ensure that we keep the right balance of both marketing and pricing and also improvements in customer service with Coca-Cola Refreshments that are taking -- that are improving every quarter. As we move into the year, I think you should also see us continuing that kind of trend in the United States going forward. And, Gary, if you want to talk about the margins?\nGary P. Fayard: A little bit on the margin. A couple of things. So North America, total volume was plus 1 on 3 points of price mix -- positive price mix. Sparkling was minus 2 on 5 points of positive price mix. And I think, Ali, your question is, is that kind of the elasticities and kind of the relationship we would expect to see going forward? And I'd tell you a couple of things. One, in a very rational pricing environment, so I think you have to underline that, and it is, the historical elasticity models would have said that you would have seen a lot greater volume decline, greater than 2%, if you took 5% of pricing. So I think that's a very good thing, obviously. Going forward, in a more normalized market, where you're not seeing the huge commodity spikes that we've seen over the last 2 years, I think a much healthier environment, we would want to see sparkling growing kind of the low 1 or 2 percentage points, kind of -- and more moderate pricing on top of that to still get a 3% or 4% or something revenue growth, but do it in a more balanced fashion with -- between volume and price, but...\nMuhtar Kent: And just one thing to add to that, Ali, also. I think it's important to remember that 2011 was probably a special year, where we've had to face tremendous increases and changes in commodity costs like we hadn't faced before. I mean, that's, in the United States, to the tune of about $550 million. And although it hasn't continued, thank goodness, at the same rate, we also are facing some commodity increases, of course, this year, too, not anywhere close to what it was. So have to remember what kind of pricing we had to take to ensure that our business could continue to invest for sustainable future growth in the United States coming off of 2011.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. So that's great. And I hope the better-than-expected elasticity kind of boldens a little bit more pricing, which is good. But -- so just if I could squeeze in a housekeeping perhaps question. It may or may not be a housekeeping, I guess. But on the balance sheet -- and, Gary, this may be for you. There's always a lot of moving parts, and we kind of try to keep track of it. But this quarter was another one of kind of large shifts from cash to short-term investments, large increase in marketable securities. What exactly are you doing? And what's the impact to the P&L, if any?\nGary P. Fayard: Yes. Most of it does not have much impact to the P&L at all. What you're seeing us do is, as we continue to build cash, most of that cash or a large part of that cash is offshore. We are moving into separately managed accounts, and so reducing exposure to banks, particularly, so that we are diversifying risk. And then we're also investing some of that -- rather than in a savings account, if you will, we're putting some of it into government bonds and some -- and AAA-rated other investments, all short-term. But it's basically just ensuring that we are diversifying against any concentrations of risk.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alice Longley of Buckingham Research Group.\nAlice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: My question is about volume in the second half. You've already indicated that price mix should be slowing. Can you give us some indication of what volume should look like, and particularly Brazil, the U.S. and China, versus what we've seen in the second quarter?\nMuhtar Kent: Yes. I mean, I think you'll appreciate that we can't give forecasts. But I think you've heard us say that we feel confident, despite the volatility that we would be looking at, reiterating our long-term targets of 3% to 4% volume growth and, again, that we manage a great portfolio of 206 markets. And we believe that based on our -- both marketing programs, as well as our strength of our brands, the strength of our system, that we would be able to reiterate our long-term growth target in terms of volume of 3% to 4% for not just the remaining part of the year, but going into the future.\nAlice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Well, we've had some macro slowdown occur during the course of the second quarter in China and Brazil. And we've seen a little slowdown in your numbers. And then just is that going to continue? Or are we going to sort of stay at these second quarter levels?\nMuhtar Kent: I can't comment on that. But look, you've seen us in the past -- if you take the last 3 or 4 years, where we've been operating in this economic environment, you've seen us have quarters of 3% or even less or 5% or 6%. And so when less than 3 or 4 things go bad, then you'll see us higher volumes. When some more things all combine in a certain time frame, you may see less. But over a period of time -- longer period of time, we feel that the 3% to 4% is a good number to look at in terms of -- which is our long-term growth targets. We've never changed them and we think -- and generating -- for a business our size, generating a 7% revenue growth, comp currency neutral revenue growth across the world, that's, in my book, continuing to crack the calculus for growth.\nAlice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: And then could I ask a different question, which follows up with some that have been asked before? And this is the operating profit performance in North America. I think you've indicated that it will continue to get better sequentially in North America. And yet you've highlighted a sort of unfavorable mix in terms of channel and I think product as well and price mix here. So why do we have sequential improvement in operating profits here in North America coming?\nMuhtar Kent: Gary, do you want to...\nGary P. Fayard: Yes, yes. I'll take that one. I think what -- you've been seeing us deliver sequential improvements. I don't know that the third quarter versus the second quarter in North America -- probably, it won't be the same kind of sequential improvement you saw from minus 9 to 0. But I think you'll see some improvement in the third quarter, although there are some macro and consumer issues in the United States just because of the condition of this economy and all. And then you will see -- I would expect to see a fairly significant improvement then in the fourth quarter, particularly as you has that [ph] -- as an operating business, a finished products business has significant leverage that will come through in the fourth quarter, particularly with the extra days and the 2 extra days in the fourth quarter.\nAlice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: The fourth quarter is clear. I'm just trying to figure out why we get improvement in the third quarter versus the second.\nGary P. Fayard: Just because we continue to work on the business. But I'm not saying it's going to be significant improvement. It's just there should be -- our expectation is there should be a little improvement in the third quarter.\nMuhtar Kent: Look, we have said that in the United States, we started -- when we started the business that we pointed out that there's going to be sequential improvement. It's also partly on how the commodities are priced into our business, and also how marketing spend operates -- the marketing spend curve operates in our business and a number of other things. So we do expect to see, as we have seen in the second quarter, which we pointed out in the first quarter, we will continue to see sequential improvement as a result of some of those other things that I've also mentioned, as well as the strength of our marketing programs going into the third quarter, particularly related to the Olympics, as well as many other local programs. In the United States, we've never had more customer partners pick up and align with us on the Olympic activation as in these Olympic Games.\nGary P. Fayard: One other thing I'll point out, and it's kind of tactical, but in timing, in the last year, most of or about half of the Fourth of July holiday was in the second quarter. The impact was in the second quarter, and then a little bit in the third quarter. The way the calendar fell this year, basically all or most of the Fourth of July holiday in North America will be in the third quarter, which helps the third quarter.\nOperator: And our final question today comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.\nJudy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Gary, just a follow-up to some of the earlier questions. If I take the puts and takes in terms of some of the changes to your guidance, so you've got better commodities, you've got better tax rate, and then you've got a bit worse interest income, and then worse FX. So net-net, my math sort of comes to kind of a wash in terms of some of those puts and takes. Do you sort of get the same calculation, just in terms of some of the puts and takes, to those aspects of the changes that you've talked about?\nGary P. Fayard: Yes. If you look at tax, so you've got -- kind of depending on where you were. But if you take 0.8 points on tax, that will give you $0.03 or $0.04 a share. You've got probably down $0.01 or so relative to interest. So commodities, let's call it $50 million probably positive. That's another $0.01 or so. So those are starting to wash. But then FX is going to be worse, and particularly worse in the third quarter, significantly worse in the third quarter. And then we have previously said kind of mid-single-digits headwind. I think my words were exactly the high end of our previously communicated mid-single-digits. So kind of depending on where you were. But the risk aversion that investors around the world have gone to has really driven the dollar, particularly against the emerging market currencies because the others, even on the euro, were hedged for the year. But it's primarily those emerging market currencies have really been driven hard -- hit hard just because of risk aversion.\nJudy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Yes. I guess, I was just trying to understand how the gross margin impact in BIG and international from a transactional perspective, that is captured in your FX guidance.\nGary P. Fayard: No, no. We do not include the impact of currency on cost of goods in the FX guidance. So that's on top of it.\nJudy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's on top, okay. And then just finally, switch quickly on the U.S. So the channel and the pack shift that you're seeing, why do you think it's only a temporary shift? And sort of -- and a little bit more of a color, just because if you look at the data, I mean, take-home channel has been declining at a faster pace. You've had immediate consumption channel that's been growing. Is that not enough to really offset what's going on within kind of the immediate consumption side, the mix shift that you're seeing? And then if that's the case, I'm just surprised that the categories, like energy drink, continues to really accelerate even into June. So what are some of dynamics that you're seeing as it relates to some of the channel and product shift that you've talked about? And I guess, why is that more of a temporary situation in your view?\nMuhtar Kent: I think, first -- this is Muhtar. I think, first, you've got to take into account the pricing environment. 5%, I mean, that is a pricing environment that you won't see coming through all the time. And therefore, I think you need to put it into that perspective, and therefore, look at it in that regard. And also as you know, over time, the pricing impact gets evened out and the consumers get back to a normalized sort of sequence. And so I think you will be seeing some of that happen in the United States. That's one reason. The second reason is the strength of our programs. The third reason is what Gary mentioned in terms of holiday season falling into the quarter as opposed to not in the quarter, et cetera, et cetera. So there's a lot of number of reasons why we're talking about it being not a permanent feature but a feature that will wash out through time. That's why. And so I hope that explains some of that. Thank you, Gary and Jackson. And in closing, I think I'd like to once again reiterate that we had a strong quarter and delivered quality midyear performance results. Along with our partners, bottling partners, customer partners, we're successfully navigating through an unpredictable external economic environment with a well-aligned system equipped for long-term sustainable growth. Our 2020 Vision is working. Our system remains resolutely focused on capturing the great opportunities we see ahead in all of the markets. And as we partner with our global consumers, customers, communities, we fundamentally believe we are building something lasting and something good while creating long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. As always, we thank you for your interest and your investment in our company, and thank you for joining us this morning.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference.

I'm joined by Muhtar Kent, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Fayard, our Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report. In addition, I would also like to note that we have posted schedules on our company website at www.thecoca-colacompany.com, under the Reports & Financial Information tab in the Investors section, which reconciles certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to by our senior executives in our discussion this morning, and from time to time in discussing our financial performance to our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Please look on our website for this information. Now I'll turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased with our first quarter results. I've never been more excited about the prospects for our brands, as well as our system, or more proud of our people who are driving our consistent and quality performance results. We continue to deliver volume, value and profit growth as we enter the third year of our 2020 Vision, and we once again saw positive volume growth across every one of our 5 geographic operating groups. We also continue to gain volume and value share globally in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages and in every sparkling and still beverage category in which we compete. We are winning with our global sparkling beverage portfolio, which was up a solid 4% this past quarter, led by the global growth of brand Coca-Cola, which was up also a healthy 4%. And we are continuing to win with our global still beverage portfolio, which grew a strong 9% this quarter. As we stand a little less than a quarter of the way into our journey towards our 2020 Vision, today's results demonstrate yet again how we are passionately and effectively refreshing a thirsty world with a capable, resilient and advantaged global bottling system.  Before reviewing our quarterly operating results, let's take a few moments to address today's mixed global economic environment. With respect to Europe, we are observing ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty as 2012 unfolds. Austerity measures implemented across the region are weighing on consumer confidence, which recently reached its lowest level since the first quarter of 2009. Despite the challenges in Europe, we are executing on all fronts to drive performance and share gains. So while we expect the macroeconomic conditions will remain difficult in Europe throughout 2012, we remain cautiously encouraged by our performance in this market. Turning to the United States. Despite its struggle with a sustained period of relative high unemployment, we're pleased to see some early signs of a slowly improving macroeconomic environment. We remain firmly committed to building strong brands and creating value in the United States to capture more than our fair share of the industry's profitable growth. Finally, let me touch on recent macroeconomic developments across a couple of key BRIC markets. In China, we've all seen economists lower their 2012 GDP growth rate forecast. While we agree that there has been some moderate slowdown in China, we also believe that this is a national progression and that it is a positive for the long-term sustainable growth of the country. As we move through 2012, we anticipate that our business in China may not be immune to this cooling economy, and therefore, we may also see our volume results in China moderate to some extent. Having said that, we are confident that China will continue to serve as a double-digit growth market for our business over the long term. As for Brazil, which underwent a cooling-down period of its own in 2011, there are now signs of improving consumer sentiment. We expect this trend to hold as we move through the balance of 2012 with our business in Brazil continuing to gain market share. In summary, we always find ourselves operating in a fast-evolving global environment, one with some economies slowing, other economies stabilizing while sustaining high unemployment and still others improving and well on their way to recovery. In all cases, we remain intently focused on realizing our 2020 Vision, and we will keep investing through these challenging times to drive long-term advantaged and sustainable growth. So if we have learned anything these past few years, it is that during times of ongoing uncertainty, consumers are even thirstier for brands that inspire real moments of optimism and happiness. Turning now to our total company performance results. Our volume grew 5% in the quarter, ahead of our long-term target and fueled by organic volume growth in all 5 geographic operating groups. As for our financial results, we grew comparable currency-neutral net revenue by 7%, and we grew comparable currency-neutral operating income by 8% once you adjust for the cycling of lower commodity cost in the prior period. As such, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year 2012 operating income results in line with our long-term targets. Now let's review our performance results across our global markets in more detail, beginning with North America, our flagship market. Our North America business was up 2%, delivering an eighth consecutive quarter of growth. Importantly, our North America system once again led the industry, capturing volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Our sparkling beverages in North America were up 1% in the quarter, with brand Coca-Cola also positive in the quarter while further improving its brand health scores. The momentum behind both Coke Zero as well as Fanta continues, with these brands up 9% and 4%, respectively, this quarter, and we also earned higher pricing in North America, which enabled us to generate a positive 3% price mix for both bottled and canned sparkling beverages, as well as our total North America beverage business. Our still beverages in North America were up 6% in the quarter, gaining both volume and value share while delivering industry-leading results across many categories. In sports drinks, POWERADE grew double digits yet again this quarter while once again capturing volume and value share. Our glac\u00e9au trademark grew 9%, also capturing volume and value share, led by another quarter of double-digit growth for both smartwater and vitaminwater zero. And our key performance again accelerated this quarter, up double digits, led by Gold Peak, which grew double digits for the 20th conservative -- consecutive quarter. And in water, DASANI also expanded double digits this quarter with the national rollout of our innovative PlantBottle that is positively impacting purchase intent and brand equity. As we've said many times before, we believe North America is a growth market for our business. Despite a challenging competitive and macroeconomic backdrop, our results both validate this belief and provide us with every reason to remain optimistic about the long-term outlook for America. Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which grew 8% in the quarter, including 6% growth for brand Coca-Cola. In China, the overall beverage industry was not immune from the impact of the economic slowdown we mentioned earlier, as well as the unseasonably cold weather that occurred during this quarter's Chinese New Year celebration. Despite this, our business in China delivered a solid 9% growth this quarter while cycling a strong first quarter last year. And importantly, our rightsizing efforts are generating strong incremental transactions in line with our expectations. Sparkling beverage transactions were up double digits this past quarter, driven by the expansion of our 300 ml package. This helped us capture both volume and value share in the sparkling beverage category this quarter. Just a few weeks ago, I was pleased and honored to inaugurate our 42nd bottling plant in China in Yingkou. This new plant is now our largest production facility in China, with an expected annual production capacity of more than 5 billion servings of sparkling and still beverages. This new LEED-certified plant is part of our system's 3-year $4 billion China investment plan and reaffirms our strong commitment to China. Japan's first quarter results were up 3%, building on the great work done by our system to restore and strengthen our business during a very challenging 2011. Our Japan business gained both volume and value share in the nonalcoholic beverages this quarter. And this growth in Japan was broad-based, with numerous sparkling and still beverages delivering positive results, including brand Coca-Cola up 2%, Fanta up 6%, I LOHAS water up 4% and Georgia coffee up 3%. Additionally, our Japan business grew across all channels, including convenience stores and vending. Also during the quarter, our Japan business unit was recognized with our company's highest honor, the 2011 Woodruff Cup based on the business unit's achievement of key performance metrics as set forth in our 2020 Vision. As such, we remain confident that our system in Japan is well aligned and in strong -- in a strong position to deliver full year, low single-digit growth in 2012. I also want to call out 2 other markets within this diverse and dynamic geographic region of the world. First, our business in the Philippines is growing again, up mid single digits this past quarter, reflecting how the hard work put in by our Bottling Investment Group keeps yielding strong results. While we believe there is still much opportunity left to be captured in the Philippines, we also believe that our business there is on the right track and that we are successfully building the capabilities needed to deliver consistent and sustainable growth. Second, our business in Thailand grew over 20% in the first quarter, and brand Coca-Cola was up over 30% as we build momentum in this market while investing for the future. We have plans in place to expand our beverage production capabilities in this fast-growing market, consistent with our system's culture of targeted investment that underpins our 2020 Vision. Moving now to Latin America, our volume grew 5% for the quarter, including 4% growth for brand Coca-Cola. In the process, we gained additional share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as in both sparkling and still beverages in Latin America this quarter. Latin America's solid first quarter results were driven by our consistent growth in Mexico, improved results in Brazil, and high single-digit growth in both our Latin Center and South Latin regions. In Mexico, we delivered 3% growth, cycling 14% from last year. We captured additional nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share in Mexico, and this is a further testament to our team's ability to execute clear occasion-based channel strategies across all beverage categories in our highest per capita market. As for Brazil, we reiterated many times last year that as this country's economy improved, so would our results. This quarter's 4% volume growth in Brazil validates this belief, and importantly, our continued volume and value share gains in Brazil are a testament to our sustained long-term growth strategies which never wavered during last year's economic slowdown. Looking ahead, we expect our 2012 growth results in Brazil to remain steady at low to single \u2013 mid-single digits as the Brazilian economy recovers. And our commitment to the future of Brazil has never been stronger, as shown by our system's recent announcement to accelerate our investments in Brazil to nearly $8 billion through 2016. Our Eurasia and Africa business grew a strong 9% in the quarter, including solid 9% growth for brand Coca-Cola. Our overall group results were led by robust growth across the entire region, including growth in India, Russia, South Africa, the Middle East and North Africa. Overall performance was once again led by India, which grew 20% in the quarter, delivering balanced growth across all categories. I was particularly encouraged by brand Coca-Cola's 27% growth in India this past quarter, and our still beverages in India were up over 20% in the quarter, led by Maaza up over 30%. Russia was up 3% this quarter, cycling last year's strong 27% growth. Our business in Russia continues to be led by the strong momentum of brand Coca-Cola, which once again delivered double-digit growth. Additionally, our Dobriy juice brand delivered 9% growth and as a result, our overall business in Russia keeps outperforming the rest of the industry, gaining nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share. Finally, we saw positive volume across growth in every other business unit in our Eurasia and Africa group, including double-digit growth in South Africa, as well as in the Middle East and North Africa region. We are excited about the future opportunities for our business in this dynamic growing part of the world. Moving now to Europe. Volume was up 1%, gaining share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Notably, this is Europe's seventh consecutive quarter of positive growth. And this growth was led by Germany, which was up 3% for the quarter, capturing, once again, share in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as in both sparkling and still beverage categories. Brand Coca-Cola was up 4% this quarter in Germany, benefiting from both our effective marketing campaigns and our consumer recruitment initiatives. In total, this marks Germany's fifth consecutive quarter of positive growth. This consistency validates how our ongoing bottling restructuring efforts have enhanced our ability to create value during difficult economic times. Another region where our business is showing signs of moderate improvement despite challenging economic conditions is Central and Southern Europe. Most markets in this region posted positive growth, including Italy which was up 4% for the quarter. Another very important geography where we achieved positive results is Spain, up 6% for the quarter. We are closely monitoring our business in both of these markets in light of recently announced austerity measures. Importantly, we believe we have the right brands, the right strategies and the right capabilities in place to continue delivering long-term sustainable growth in Europe. As we look ahead to this summer, both in Europe as well as across the world, we are very excited about the unique opportunity to grow the value of our brands even further through our investments in the 2012 London Summer Olympic Games. For context, during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, we activated 36 markets across the globe. For this year's Summer Olympics, we plan to activate almost 100 markets, leveraging content, experiences and conversations generated through our global program. This fully integrated 2012 global Olympic marketing program will be all about recruiting teams by tapping into emotional passion points like sports and music. An early success of this program is the over 160,000 YouTube views of Mark Ronson's behind-the-scenes footage as he developed our new Olympics theme song. These views were generated without any active promotions on our part and, once again, are a clear example of how we are successfully engaging consumers with innovative, compelling and shareable social media content. As we work to engage with our consumers, we're also committed to building a better tomorrow. Last month, we released our 2012 Global Water Stewardship and Replenishment Report, detailing our ongoing work to reduce, recycle and replenish the water we use around the world. To date, our company has launched 386 Community Water Partnership projects in 94 countries. These projects have improved water access for 1.6 million people, including more than 0.25 million women and children in Africa. In 2011 alone, our Community Water Partnership projects replenished 35% of the water used in our finished product beverages. These projects also benefited the communities we serve by providing sustainable agriculture training and resources to more than 12,000 farmers and by supporting the reforestation of over 30,000 hectares. As we build a better tomorrow, our efforts and performance are being recognized. This past quarter, we were humbly honored to receive several acknowledgments. Firstly, Fortune Magazine's survey of the Most Admired Companies listed us at #4 in their 2012 rankings, up from #6 in 2011 and up 20 spots from where we ranked just 5 years ago. In these same rankings, Fortune Magazine's survey once again rated us as the #1 most admired beverage company in the world. Secondly, Forbes also announced just 2 weeks ago that our company had risen to #7 on their publication's list of America's Most Reputable Companies based on a consumer survey by Reputation Institute. This ranking is up from #25 in 2011. We also saw our standing improved within the Harris Interactive reputation study, an annual survey that measures the corporate reputations of the 60 most visible companies in the U.S. In their latest survey, our company climbed to #3, up from 15th the previous year. While all of us at The Coca-Cola Company are proud of these achievements, we understand that they only represent a snapshot of where we are today rather than where we aspire to be tomorrow. As I have stated many times before, the complexity and the challenge of today's mixed global economy also brings real opportunities and exciting growth prospects. What was true on Day 1 of our 2020 Vision is still true today. Our system has only just begun to achieve its potential. We have a clear roadmap for growth, a productivity and reinvestment program that is driving efficiencies and a global bottling system that is well aligned and poised for execution. This strong alignment has not only enabled us to effectively navigate the volatility of these past several years, it has also put us in a position of real strength. That is why we are confident that our Coca-Cola system will continue to passionately refresh a thirsty world and create value for all of our consumers, customers and shareholders. And with that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Gary.\nGary P. Fayard: Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results this quarter, underscoring once again that our global system is well positioned to execute our strategic plans and alignment with our 2020 Vision. We reported comparable earnings per share of $0.89 this quarter, up 3% versus the prior year. And as Muhtar shared earlier, our earnings growth was driven by broad-based volume growth across all of our 5 operating groups. In fact, we had volume growth across nearly all of our business units within our global operations this quarter. Comparable currency-neutral operating income was up 5% this quarter. On a comparable basis, the impact of currency on this quarter's operating income results was a 2% headwind, in line with outlook we provided during our last earnings call in February. In addition, and also as for the outlook we provided through this quarter, we cycled lower commodity cost in the first quarter of 2011. Adjusting for the 3% impact relating to the cycling of these lower commodity cost, our comparable currency-neutral operating income was up 8% in the first quarter of 2012. When you also consider that this quarter had one less selling day than the first quarter of 2011, we are very pleased with this operating income result.  Comparable currency-neutral net revenue grew 7% this quarter, including a 3% increase in concentrate sales and 3% positive price mix. The currency impact on this quarter's comparable net revenue result was a 1% headwind. This quarter's 3% consolidated price mix is particularly encouraging, especially when considering today's challenging macroeconomic conditions. Looking ahead, we still expect our full year 2012 consolidated price mix results to come in between 1% and 2% in line with our long-term target range. This quarter's comparable gross margin was in line with our full year 2011 gross margin, consistent with the outlook we provided earlier this quarter. As a reminder, we expect our full year 2012 consolidated comparable gross margin to remain in line with full year 2011. Our comparable currency-neutral SG&A expenses were up 4% in the quarter as we sustained our commitment to invest in the health and the strength of our brands. As for operating expense leverage, it came in positive this quarter. For 2012, we still expect to capture low single-digit operating expense leverage as we further invest in strategic brand building initiatives around the world and effectively manage our operating expenses. Our net interest income came in at $27 million this quarter ahead of our initial forecast, primarily due to a benefit related to our interest rate swaps. As such and based on our current best estimates of interest rates in our international operations, we now expect our full year 2012 net interest income to come in at the higher end of the $20 million to $40 million range we provided in our last earnings call. In addition, we expect our net interest to come in close to even in the second quarter. We'll continue to update you on net interest outlook on a quarterly basis. Our underlying effective tax rate currently stands at 24.8% within the 24% to 25% range we communicated during our last earnings call.  As for our cash flow from operations, this increased 13% year-to-date. Please note that this cash flow result is net of the approximately $130 million in incremental contributions made to our pension plans this quarter when compared to the contributions we made to our pension plans in the first quarter of last year. With regard to our share repurchase program, our net share repurchases during the quarter totaled nearly $850 million, including accruals for stock options and treasury shares that did not settle prior to the close of the quarter. This places us well on track to achieve the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range for full year 2012 as we communicated during our last earnings call. Now let me take a moment to remind you of our full year outlook on currencies and commodities which we provided in our last earnings call. With regard to commodities, in our last call, we said that we expected the full year 2012 incremental impact of the Big 4 commodity cost on our results to range between $350 million and $450 million. And just a reminder, the Big 4 commodities are aluminum, sweetener, juice and PET. While our commodity cost outlook remains unchanged, if current trends hold, we may see this outlook slowly improve in the coming months. And we'll update you on any changes to our outlook during our next earnings call. As for currencies, based on our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we continue to expect currencies to have a mid single-digit negative impact on operating income for the full year. Furthermore, we expect to see this impact come in at the high end of this mid single-digit range in the second quarter. Let me highlight one additional item for those that model our business. In light of the recent change to our global tea joint venture with Nestl\u00e9, and as a reminder, earlier this year, we announced our agreement with Nestl\u00e9 to refocus the geographic scope of this joint venture primarily to Europe and Canada while phasing out the joint venture in most other territories by the end of 2012. Accordingly, we have eliminated the joint venture volume from our reported results for both 2011 and 2012 in those territories where the joint venture is being phased out. Please note that this change did not impact the company's reported volume results this quarter on a consolidated level or for any individual operating group. Finally, with regard to our new productivity and reinvestment program, we reconfirm our expectations to capture total incremental annualized savings of $550 million to $650 million, phased over a 4-year period, starting in 2012 through the end of 2015. As noted in our last call, these funds will serve to enhance our ongoing system-wide brand building initiatives as we reinvest in our business to drive long-term profitable growth. We're still in the initial stages of defining the total onetime cost associated with the capture of these incremental annualized savings, and we'll provide an update on these costs during our next earnings call. In summary, as we begin the third year of our 2020 Vision, we are greatly encouraged by our business achieving yet another solid quarter of quality volume, value and profit results. Our system remains healthy and financially strong. We're generating cash, investing in our world-class brands and executing our consistent growth strategies from a position of real strength. And importantly, we continue to pay a healthy dividend. Our seasoned leadership team and highly capable global bottling partners are taking the right actions and executing the right strategies to successfully realize our 2020 Vision. So while we're still navigating through an ongoing mixed global economic recovery, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year results in line with our long-term growth targets. Operator, we're now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And sir, our first question comes from Bill -- from Bryan Spillane, Bank of America.\nBryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I just had just a question. You had a very strong first quarter, and I think what was really encouraging was how broad-based your volume growth was and especially seeing markets like Japan, North America, Germany, Philippines, all sort of growing simultaneously. Think about the balance of the year. Muhtar, could you talk a little bit about how you view that performance carrying out through the balance of the year, maybe some of the factors that you've got in place or some of the activity you have in place to continue to drive that through the balance of the year? And then secondarily, maybe Gary, if you could just talk about if it's a -- given your potentially better view on cost balance of the year and the potential for some volume performance continuing to be well -- doing well this year, just better drop through profitability, I guess as we move through the year, if we can just talk a little bit about that as well.\nMuhtar Kent: Bryan, good morning, thanks. This is Muhtar. I think what I'd like to just get -- the message I'd like to get across is that we leave behind the first quarter of 2012 with confidence and with momentum in our business. And I think it is broad-based growth, as you mentioned. In fact, the top 10 countries in our business generated about 65% -- a little over 65% of the total incremental growth cases -- organic unit case growth in the quarter. And that is more broad-based than in the past. And that's a good sign. And I think we've always said that there's tremendous -- I see -- everywhere I go, I see tremendous opportunity for our brands. Our system is strong. Our system -- this is the result of investments that our system continues to make every quarter and also generating revenue, and we're able to crack this calculus for growth. And everywhere we go in this difficult macroeconomic environment, it's important to note that The Coca-Cola system is one of the most important net contributors to the economy. Globally, we're one of the top 10 private employers, nongovernmental employers, and we create -- based on our vision, we will create an additional 120,000 new jobs in the next 10 years. And more and more, governments are recognizing that unemployment is the #1, #2 and #3 priority. And I think with that, with our system, we're earning our right every day in every market. And that's important. As I -- obviously, the macroeconomic conditions around the world is challenged. The recovery is slow. Unemployment remains high and is -- I believe will remain high as we go through this year. But the premise, Bryan, on which we've built our 2020 Vision holds true today. What we said is no matter how you slice and dice it, there will be about 1 billion new people coming into the middle class. We'll have about 800 million new urbanized consumers in the decade. This decade that we're talking about, 2010 to 2020. Now the quarter we just left behind, about 22 million new urbanized consumers and about 22 million to 25 million new middle class have been created in the world, and we were there to serve their needs and refresh them. So yes, challenged environment; yes, slow recovery; yes, some slowing down in emerging markets. But when we talk about slowing down, you go down from a 9% to an 8.5% or an 8.2%, I think there is still tremendous amount of growth and middle class creation around the world, whether you take Africa, Latin America, Asia, and we're there. And in the western markets, we've always said our balanced -- our vision calls for balanced growth, balanced in geographies, balanced in portfolio. And once again, we were able to validate that, that is something that we are able to execute with our -- passionately with our bottling partners. So I'll now pass it over to Gary to answer the second part of your question.\nGary P. Fayard: Bryan, I guess I'd say a couple of things. As we look, it is still a challenged economic environment across the world. We have seen -- if you think back, actually first quarter of 2010, things looked like, economically, they were getting better and then they didn't. First quarter of 2011 looked like things were getting better and then they didn't. And then we've seen the significant volatility around commodities and currencies across the world over the last several years as well. So I think -- I guess where we are is trying to be somewhat conservative and try to say we're 3 quarters -- or 3 months into the year, 1 quarter into the year, the kind of the smallest quarter in fact, and I think we need to continue to go through the year. Are things looking better? Yes, it looks like interest is a little -- interest income is going to be a little bit better. It looks like if things hold, commodities will probably be better. So things are actually looking pretty good, but I think at this point, our view was, we kind of hold with where we are. We kind of get through another quarter to kind of see how the year is going. Is the economic recovery that we're starting to slowly see in the U.S. going to continue or not? So that's kind of where we are. We're kind of being -- trying to be conservative and recognize that we are in this as a marathon and not as a sprint. This is about long-term value creation.\nMuhtar Kent: Just one point I'd add to -- that to, Bryan, is that 4 years ago, we made some bets in terms of our strategy, our 2020 Vision, and I think those are now positioning us to win. And I'd say that in this volatile world environment, I think we see -- we are definitely a great hedge and a balanced hedge in what's happening in the world.\nBryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And just -- Gary, just as a follow-up, if it's -- if there's upside -- or Gary and Muhtar, if there's upside, more inclined to invest some of that back particularly given the momentum you have in some of these markets, is that -- is there more room to invest if there's more funds generated?\nMuhtar Kent: Well, I'm happy to say that we are investing. If you look at our marketing spend and if you look at how we're controlling all OpEx in the right way and then spending on our brands and you'll see that some of those numbers in the first quarter, too, coming to life and that's basically how we've always managed this business, investing in our brands, investing for the long term, ensuring that we -- our brands remain healthy and get healthier all the time, which they are. And that generates, again, a great system alignment, a great investment picture from our -- the total cash that we generated with our bottling partners. And I said it before, the results that you see this quarter, this past quarter, are not coming from the investments we made in this quarter. They're coming from the investments that we made 4, 5, 6, 7 quarters ago, and the same is going to be true from 4 quarters or 5 quarters from now based on investments we're making today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Caroline Levy, CLSA.\nCaroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Muhtar, the last time we met, you said that you were headed off to Asia and you did share quite a bit of your enthusiasm with us already, but can you talk a little more in depth about the prospects for Japan, China, and what the other real big drivers of growth will be going forward, and how owning your bottlers in some key markets within China and Japan is impacting the business?\nMuhtar Kent: Caroline, yes, I just spent a good bit of time in Asia a couple of weeks ago. And I think you've seen the Pacific Group's volume growth up 8%, which was broad-based in the quarter with the numbers that we've shared with you for places like -- not just China and Japan up 9% and 3%, respectively, but also for Thailand and the Philippines and so forth. And I think importantly, again, very encouraged that brand Coca-Cola is up 6% in that massive geography, and reported net revenue for the quarter up 12%. And I think -- and good price mix across. So it's important really to be able to ensure that when you have -- when we talk about sustainable growth, we mean growth not just in volume, not just in a certain category, but broad-based growth and also growth in the revenue line that can be matched or better than the volume line, and I think we've seen that. And yes, no question, everyone you talk to, whether it's the shop owner in any particular part of China or whether it's the government, or whether it's some national government, there is a little cooling down. Is that -- I think that's healthy. And I think that's healthy for the real estate market in China. That's healthy for the banking industry in China. That's healthy for the long-term sustainable growth of the economy in China, which I have no doubt is going to continue. So we see China as a fantastic opportunity. As I said, we've just opened our largest-to-date facility in China, 42nd, and the largest of them all, and LEED-certified on top of it. And that's again one sign of our commitment, many more such factories to come in our $4 billion announced investment program for China. And so I see China as certainly playing an important role for our 2020 Vision. And particularly pleased about Japan, where I met with all our bottling partners in Tokyo and presented their Woodruff Cup awards to each one of our bottling partners. And again, category by category, we see very good improvement in our business in Japan. So the terrible tragedy of 2011 allowed us to galvanize our system and strengthen our system and continue to grow our system. And importantly, every channel, important channel, like convenience, like vending, is now expected to grow in Japan. And that's a very important thing for our business -- and categories, whether it's coffee with Georgia or sparkling or tea. Again, we're generating growth. So prospects, I think overall, we've always said the picture of success in Japan is low single-digit growth. And I believe that we're poised well to achieve that target for Japan. And then I went to Thailand, where we're having, as I said, very good growth prospects and share gains, tremendous share gains in that important market, with a very healthy consumption habit for sparkling beverages. And I see -- whether it's other markets like Vietnam or Indonesia or West Asia, I see great prospects for our growth. And I'll soon be also heading towards West Asia in a couple of months. And again, you heard the results that we've been able to post this past quarter in India, continue to have very healthy brand metrics for Coca-Cola, as well as our still brands there in that incredibly prospective geography. So I think Asia, overall, little cooling, healthy and great long-term prospects for both our business, as well as I think leading the world out of some of the current global macro issues.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.\nJudy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Muhtar -- sort of couple of questions, Muhtar or Gary, on North America. One, just in terms of the underlying industry performance and your performance in North America, obviously, the macro has been getting a little bit better but just in Q1, do you think that there was any benefit from a weather perspective, if you've seen a big shift from take-home into immediate consumption? And then talking about your performance in the context of the competitive backdrop, where, obviously, Pepsi has talked about spending more money, so what sort of impact are you seeing from a competitive perspective in North America? And then Gary, just on the profitability side in North America, if you can just walk us through the puts and takes in Q1 as it relates to cycling of the commodities and kind of for the balance of the year, how should we think about the phasing of commodities and the margins in North America as we go forward?\nMuhtar Kent: Judy, let me just take the first part of the question. I think we continue to see validation, a little more validation, on what I indicated also in the previous call. There are some signs, healthier signs, from the U.S. consumer right now than it was 12 months ago at this time in terms of more travel, more mobility, more bookings. And mobility is an important factor for our business for consumer goods. And also, I think eating out, a little healthier numbers in terms of that, that we were seeing compared to, say, 12 to 16 months ago. Having said that -- and I do believe that, that trend is likely to continue, providing we can sort of keep -- have some prices on the -- at the pump for gasoline where -- about where they stay now. So I premise that with that caveat. I think for -- we have always said that United States is a growth business. Despite the current macroeconomic challenges, we've been posting growth quarter after quarter. I'm very pleased that this past quarter also that sparkling beverages was positive, brand Coca-Cola was positive. And we've started putting together the framework for our growth in North America way before the acquisition of the CCE business in North America. I want to reiterate that once again. The brand, price, pack, channel architecture, the -- beginning -- getting our brands to a healthier position than they were previously, getting the right package to be sold at the right outlet and the right channel at the right price, all of that architecture we started working on 3 to 4 years ago. And I think we are seeing some results out of all of that work. And as I've said, we believe that the positive sentiment that we see compared to a year ago of the U.S. consumer, slightly positive sentiment would probably continue is what I would estimate, providing other conditions hold, particularly the price of gasoline. Gary?\nGary P. Fayard: Yes. Judy, I'd say just a couple of things. And the first, I just want to congratulate our colleagues in North America because I think if you -- as you think about it and think about this quarter, it was sparkling plus 1, brand Coca-Cola positive growth in the quarter. And those are things that not that long ago, I think everyone listening in this call would have said it's impossible to do. And it's really working. Everything that Muhtar is talking about is actually working. And our brand score is getting better because of the things we have been doing over the last few years. But then, if you look at, \"All right, great, Gary, got that, but let's talk about the financial results and you're showing that on a comparable basis, operating income is down 9% quarter on quarter. So how do you talk about that?\" Well, on that one, that is the issue that I alerted, I think, all of you to earlier this quarter. The way the commodities hit last year, that $800 million of commodity pressure that we had last year, it all was in quarters 2, 3 and 4, basically, none of it in the numbers in Q1 in North America. So when you adjust for that for just commodities, that minus 9 actually gets to only slightly negative. And then you have to recognize that there was one less day. You adjust for that and actually, North America suddenly flips into it was actually positive. You take that then you look at remainder of year, and you recognize that we've gotten the pricing so that the commodities aren't going to be that as big an issue going forward, remainder of year. And all the other things we've been doing, we would expect to see North America in very good positive territory, remainder of year. Things are going, knock on wood, exactly the way we planned for them, too, at this point.\nMuhtar Kent: Just one last quick add onto that, Judy. Importantly to note, the strategic focus in North America remains consistent on continuing to build strong brands, creating value with our customers and building our systems, continuing to build our system capability. And so the strategic focus remains in place. Secondly, in this past quarter, I'd note also that IC growth was ahead of total volume growth in North America. That also helped generate a good price mix for our total business. And also, of course, I just want to make sure I mention the share gains that are continuing across the board in North America for us.\nJudy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. Gary, just on -- so if I think about that 3%, the cycling of the lower commodity impact on your operating profit, that's about $75 million. And when you think about you're saying North America would have been slightly down x that cycling. So the impact on North America from that would have been about $50 million and the rest would be in BG -- BIG?\nGary P. Fayard: Yes, the rest would have been in BIG.\nJudy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, and the phasing of the $400 million of commodities this year is much more evenly spread out. I guess we'll see depending on the commodity cost as we go forward, but it's much more evenly spread out. So we should start to see really the much more benign impact starting in Q2.\nGary P. Fayard: Very well put. That's exactly right, exactly right. And then as I kind of mentioned when -- to Bryan's question earlier, if then commodities hold with where they are today, that actually $350 million to $450 million, so call it $400 million, actually could be coming down to the lower end and becoming more favorable versus what we've been talking about.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo.\nBonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I wanted to go back to a question on China. I was actually hoping you could talk about the competitive landscape given Pepsi's new strategic alliance with Tingyi and how that may impact your business and strategy. I guess thinking about it, the alliance of the 2 strong competitors, wouldn't this accelerate the pace that you execute your game plan? And also, could you give us some color on how you will allocate the $4 billion investment among your different initiatives there? For instance, will you spend more on infrastructure than brand building in the next few years?\nMuhtar Kent: Okay, Bonnie. I think we have a strategy for China. That strategy is not changing with what's happening across the industry. I want to reiterate that. That strategy is valid and still in place. And obviously, it will evolve as we introduce a wider variety of packages to promote affordability, it has the consumer experience with our brands, all with a focus to drive incremental increased transactions and profitable growth. And to continue building brand equity with consumers, I think this is critical for us and that will -- you will see us continue to do that. I believe that we're confident in our ability to deliver double-digit growth over the long term, and I think continuing introduction of a wider variety of packages to promote affordability and I think immediate consumption growth. So we will continue driving all of those priorities. As far as the investments are concerned, $4 billion, that I would say probably it's -- you could allocate about 50% into infrastructure and 50% into the brand building area. That's probably a good split. And if you looked at the past 3 years, that's probably where it ended up.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.\nJohn A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Gary, just wanted to follow up on Judy's question a little bit, which was -- and I apologize if I missed this. If we strip out the commodity stuff, what have you, the revenue growth was still great but the operating profit, I think, was still down. So is that a profit mix issue? Is that simply an investment issue? And then Muhtar, I just was wondering if you could clarify something because in your comments, you guys hadn't stated explicitly that you would gain share in sparkling, but you just mentioned that you had share gains across the board. So is that a safe assumption then that you guys did in fact have share gains in North America in sparkling?\nGary P. Fayard: Yes, John. Let me start -- well, in fact, I'll go ahead and answer that last part first. We did have share gains pretty much across the board, across the world and the U.S. So we did have share gains in sparkling. On the commodity issue relative to North America, and if I don't exactly answer the question, just come back and tell me, but basically, if you strip out the commodity impact, North America's OI for the quarter instead of being down 9 would have been down 1. It's exactly what it would have been. And if then -- if you add in an extra day, it would have been positive. So what you're seeing is that 1 day, actually 1 less day, is having a huge impact on the P&L because you've got basically all of the costs going through for the full quarter with a day less sales is basically what's happening, which is why when you go to Q2 and 3, actually, it becomes much more normalized and the commodities are not an issue at all. In fact, it kind of reverses a little bit because you had more of that hitting in Q2 and 3 last year, with none of it hitting in Q1 last year. So it's kind of a cycling thing, but that's why when you adjust for all that, our view is and what we had planned and what we saw all along is that North America actually started to improve significantly after Q1 into the remainder of the year. And that's kind of what -- that's exactly what we're seeing today.\nJohn A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, so if we look at that impact, I know you have 2 extra selling days in Q4, right?\nGary P. Fayard: Right, that's right.\nJohn A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So if we map out the cadence over the course of the year, it seems like what we probably should see and you factor in your FX guidance, is it -- should we be looking at the numbers sort of a little more back-end loaded, a little more Q4 weighted with a little bit tougher Q2 when you put all this stuff together? Is that kind of the right cadence then?\nGary P. Fayard: Yes, John, it is. It is. Now the CFO is going to come out in me, okay, because when my own guys -- and I get a rolling estimate here. And when I see that, I say, \"Oh, you've given me a hockey stick,\" and so we're -- you try to manage against that as you're managing the business appropriately. But the cadence of the business this year actually is exactly as you just said it. That's exactly right. It is more back-end loaded because of how the commodities hit and went through the P&L last year and the 1 day less in the first quarter, 2 extra days in the fourth quarter. Some of the reason -- I have to hedge a little bit on this, is because there was 1 less day, you had a little bit of an Easter shift to help probably the first quarter slightly, but you really can't measure it. So I'd say basically, what you're saying is exactly right.\nMuhtar Kent: And just to add on the North America front, John, I think it's important to note that we -- North America, I want to reiterate, had a great quarter in terms of both volume, revenue, overall NARTD share gains. And also, we see, importantly, a rational pricing environment in North America. A 3% price mix gain is very important, and I think those things should really give indication of health of the business as we move into the second and third quarters, important second and third quarters of the year. And therefore, I am pleased with the results in North America. And again, I think Gary explained the anomaly of comparability there in terms of the operating income number.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.\nWilliam Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Can you just talk about the global competitive environment relative to what you thought it was going to be heading into the year? I know you discussed North America a little bit. Can you broaden that globally? And I have a follow-up.\nMuhtar Kent: Yes, well, it's hand-to-hand combat out there every single day and everywhere -- but everywhere I go, everywhere our operators go, everywhere our leadership goes, we see opportunity. We see opportunity for our brands that are stronger. We earn our price every day. We're generating revenue growth. We're net contributors to the economies, and our brands are healthy. And our IC business is growing ahead of our total business, and that's a good thing for the world. Our IC business globally grew 6% in the world compared to 5% global volume growth. And by the way, this volume growth that we just had in the first quarter is one of the highest organic volume growths we've had in the last, say, 8 to 10 quarters that I look back, because this is all-pure organic growth and it is strong and there is momentum. And I think, as I've said, the competitive environment, I think, out in the world is obviously, consumers are reticent to go out, to spend money. The environment is not healthy, particularly in Europe in terms of consumer sentiment, but our business is able to continue to invest and also ensure that we generate value for our customers in Europe, in this case large customers, large format, small format. And one of the really important metrics that we always follow is immediate consumption, which is a healthier mix. It's growing ahead of our total business. And once again, that is a testament to the strength of our system because you can always -- it's much easier to go and gain distribution in the future consumption channel, but in order to ensure that you supply and work in partner with every single small format store takes a very strong and a very different kind of system, which is the one we have.\nWilliam Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Great, and maybe just a little more granular, I mean, relative to what you expected headed into the year, because it seems like maybe in Europe, the promotional and pricing environments may be a little bit worse and then we obviously saw Pepsi show their cards, and perhaps the competitive environment in North America is a little better. Is that fair?\nMuhtar Kent: I think the environment in Europe is not any better for sure. But look at some of the numbers that I shared with you earlier, up 6% in Spain, up 4% in Italy, up -- Germany continues to grow, Southeast Europe beginning to show signs. I've said before, Europe is a tale of 2, 3 cities at least. You've got Eastern Europe beginning to come out, led by Russia. You've got Southern Europe beginning to stabilize, and Central and Northern Europe is still -- and led by Germany is -- I think the sentiment is slightly improving. So overall, the Southern Europe still remains an importantly challenged area, but our business system is very strong in Southern Europe, and we're benefiting from that. In the U.S., as I said, consumer sentiment in terms of mobility, in terms of travel bookings, in terms of travel with -- on the highways, in terms of eating out, is better than it was 12 to 16 months ago.\nGary P. Fayard: This is Gary. I want to come back, John Faucher, on your question. I want to correct one thing. In North America's share, I went back and looked at the numbers as we were looking at this. We gained value and volume share in total nonalcoholic beverages. We gained significant volume and value share in still. In sparkling, it was a slight loss of share. And the reason I said that we actually gained share is internally, as I was thinking about it, I was actually taking some pipeline, filling out. That's not the way you should look at it. So there was a slight loss of share.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Gary and Jackson. In closing, this quarter's results provide yet another proof point that our company and our system are on track to deliver our 2020 Vision. The tremendous opportunity we see ahead for our company in all of our markets remain intact. As always, we thank you for your interest and investment in our company. There is no greater responsibility than earning and maintaining your trust and your confidence. You can rest assured that our entire leadership team is working diligently to protect and grow the value of your investment in our company.

I want to start off today by recognizing that many of you are attending the CAGNY conference this week, given the timing of our earnings call and the fact that I will also presenting at CAGNY this coming Friday, we will keep our prepared remarks a little bit shorter to ensure that we have adequate time for your questions and that we can get you back into the conference. With 2013 behind us I am now looking forward to joining forces with our global system associates as we work to restore momentum to our business in 2014. 2013 was clearly marked by ongoing persistent macroeconomic challenges and our business was not immune to these pressures. Nevertheless we delivered sound financial results and we grew global value share in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages for a 26th consecutive quarter.  Our volume -- our worldwide volume grew 1% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the full-year. We delivered full-year comparable currency neutral operating income growth of 6% after excluding the impact of structural changes off of a comparable currency neutral ex-structural revenue growth of 3% for the full-year. And we delivered full-year comparable currency neutral EPS growth of 8% in line with our long-term growth targets. This performance underscores our ability to generate sound financial results even in a challenging environment.  Our sparkling brands grew 1% in the full-year cycling 3% with brand Coca-Cola adding nearly a 100 million unit cases. In fact all of our billion dollar Sparkling brands except for Diet Coke Coca-Cola Light grew in 2013 contributing more than 140 million incremental cases in the full year. As of the end of 2013 we've gained core sparkling value share for 17 consecutive quarters. For the full year our portfolio of still beverage brands contributed over 300 million incremental cases or 5% growth while cycling 10% growth in the prior year. Importantly, we gained volume share and value share for the year.  Our tea volume grew 11% for the full-year with solid performance across our entire tea portfolio. Juice and juice drinks grew 5% for the full year with strong performance by Minute Maid, Simply, [indiscernible] Minute Maid Pulpy Rani and InneSense. We are proud of our robust portfolio of leading juice and juice drink brands.  Sports drinks grew 2% for the full-year with Powerade continuing its solid and consistent growth performance.  Packaged water grew 5% for the full-year as we focused on growing over premium water brands and on expanding our PlantBottle and Ecoflex packaging.  While 2013 was an unusual and challenging year, it has certainly not deterred us from our commitment to our 2020 vision. Many economies around the world remained volatile in 2013, developed markets are slowly starting to recover from this turbulent time and consumer expenditures remain moderated. And emerging markets faced substantial challenges as they dealt with fluctuating currencies and other structural issues.  However, we remain optimistic and excited about the future of our business and brands in emerging markets after all per capita consumption for our brands remains relatively low in most emerging countries. That said, these emerging market conditions simply reinforce our commitment to remain focused on our long-term strategies and to keep investing through these tough times to ensure that we continue to deliver long-term sustainable growth. In Europe we saw a 1% volume decline for the year. However, we gained sparkling and still value share and we were pleased by improving volume performance in certain key markets. A better second half of the year helped our North-West Europe and Nordics business unit close 2013 with 1% volume growth while Germany continued to outperform delivering 6% volume growth for the quarter and 2% growth for the year. Our successful share of Coke campaign last summer contributed to full-year trademark Coca-Cola volume growth of 1% in North-West Europe and Nordics and 5% in Germany. We also launched share of Coke in our Iberia business unit in the fourth quarter of the past year and as in other markets the campaign has generated tremendous excitement contributing to strong double-digit immediate consumption growth and to trademark Coca-Cola growth of 2% in the quarter. Moving now to Eurasia and Africa, full-year volume grew 7% cycling 10% in the prior year and we grew volume and value share in non-alcoholic ready to drink beverages for the full-year. All our business units delivered solid full-year volume growth including double-digit volume growth in our Middle East and North Africa business units.  In Russia, strong Olympic and Christmas campaigns activated across the country view double digit growth in trademark Coca-Cola for the year and enabled us to gain core sparkling volume share while maintaining value share. Fittingly, leading up to this Olympic year our business achieved an all-time high market share for non-alcoholic ready to drink beverages. We recently completed a successful Olympic torch relay bringing the torch to thousands of Russian towns and cities and I was pleased to have an opportunity to host our customers and our bottling partners in Sochi last week where I saw our best ever activation of an Olympic asset. Our local team and bottlers are doing an excellent job in Sochi. Our Pacific Group grew 3% in the full year cycling 7% in the prior year. We were pleased to see improving trends across key markets including India, China and Japan as the year progressed.  For the full year our volume in Japan grew 1% with Sprite, Minute Maid and ISACA each growing by double digits. China contributed 3% volume growth for the full year cycling 4% in 2012 and grew 5% in the fourth quarter. We delivered balanced growth across sparkling and still beverages thanks to strong campaigns and a renewed focus on execution. We\u2019re engaging teams and driving category excitement in China through campaigns like our Mini-Me Coca-Cola campaign which contributed to double digit immediate consumption growth in the fourth quarter and our popular Share a Coke campaign last summer.  And India cycled 16% full year growth with a 4% volume increase in 2013 closing out the year with our 30th consecutive quarter of volume growth. It is remarkable to think of the business that we have built in India over the last two decades. In 2013 our system generated nearly $1.8 billion in revenue and we have four of the top five core sparkling brands, the number one juice drink brand, a commanding non-alcoholic ready to drink share and so much, so much fun tapped opportunities still ahead. Turning now to Latin America, we grew 1% for the full year [cycling] 5% in the prior year. Argentina, Mexico and Brazil all come to mind as we consider what worked for us and what was challenging in 2013 in Latin America. We were pleased with our performance in Argentina where despite challenging economic conditions our brands performed well resulting in 7% volume growth for the full year. Sparkling was an important volume driver in Argentina with Coca-Cola\u2019s Sprite and Fanta each growing mid to high single digits. Cola-Cola Life met our expectations and is playing a meaningful role as it is not just delivering incremental volume, but also enhancing the positive feelings that consumers have for Coca-Cola. We\u2019re excited about the potential of Coca-Cola Life as it has shown great promise in bringing people back into the category. It\u2019s another example of how we are working to be part of a solution to the obesity issue giving consumers a blend of sugar and natural zero calorie sweeteners.  Returning to our business in Argentina our still brands grew double digits with strong performance in packaged water with the launch of the Bonaqua Ecoflex bottle as well as solid growth in juice and juice drinks and sports drinks. In Mexico, volume growth was even for the year with still beverage volume growth offset by sparkling. Despite a solid start to 2013, we had a challenging second half of the year mostly due to severe weather. We continue to see opportunity in Mexico where our strong brands, world class execution and an improving economy bode well for the future.  Our bottling partners have adjusted their pricing as a result of the newly implemented tax and we are closely monitoring any further adjustments as needed. While we expect the change to adversely impact our volume in Mexico in the short term, it is too early to tell what the exact impact will be at this time. I will wrap up my commentary in Latin America with an update on our business in Brazil where consumers have been impacted by a slowing economy, rising prices and reduced disposable income. Full year volume was down 2% due to a disappointing 6% drop in the fourth quarter. Our local team working closely with our bottling partners has now launched an upgraded affordability strategy enhancing our [Asian] brand price pack and channel architecture. We are optimistic that this strategy together with our World Cup program will enable us to return to growth in Brazil in 2014. Turning now to North America, we remain steadfast in our commitment to building long term value in our flagship market and a commitment that calls for building strong brands, trading customer value and enhancing our system capabilities. Sandy Douglas is leading our North American business where we will again benefit from a strong customer and strategic brand expertise. Adding Paul Mulligan and Irial Finan's disciplined focus on execution at the point of sale will enable us to refine these strategies and to enhance their impact. The combined experience and expertise of this leadership team and a joint accountability for driving value will ensure that we are laser focused on continued improvement of our overall performance in this important market. We will therefore continue to assess and to evaluate the operating results in North America as an integrated business. In October of 2010, we established a four to five year timeframe to commence the refranchising of our bottling operations in North America. 2014 is the fourth year and as the North America operating model evolves, it will not only streamline our focus but if will also expedite refranchising to independent bottling partners. To date, we've closed on the first transaction of our 21st century beverage partnership model at the end of 2013 and we are very encouraged with the seamless transition of the territory. Looking ahead, we are well aligned on the transition with the other four bottlers that we announced back in 2013. We expect to reach agreements with those partners shortly and for those transactions to begin closing later in the year that we\u2019re in. We will also eminently announce new bottling partnerships whose ownership reflects the diversity of the consumers and customers we proudly serve in North America. We expect North America to deliver consistent volume, revenue and transaction growth with the balance volume and price mix that you would expect from an industry leader. We also firmly believe that the business will deliver consistent profitable growth over the long-term. 2013 was a challenging year in North America and I am not satisfied with our overall performance. Nevertheless we gained volume and value share while generating positive price mix of 1% across our portfolio and positive price mix of 2% for our sparkling brands. However, our volume was even versus prior year and operating income fell short of our targets. Sparkling beverage volume fell 2%, largely due to softer diet coke volume. We have implemented a multi-faceted approach to address category headwinds and the various misperceptions that fuel them. This effort is targeting both obesity and ingredient concerns and increase aggressive sweetener innovation, transparent consumer communications, continued packaging evolution and new partnerships with credible third parties around the world who will use meaningful facts to defend and protect the sparkling category.  While we work to nurture our sparkling business back to growth, our still beverage business continues to perform well. Still beverages grew 5% for the full year as our diverse portfolio of still beverage brands continues to outperform the competition. Thanks to continuous innovation and to growing brands like Powerade, Simply, Gold Peak and Smartwater, the fourth quarter marks the 15th consecutive quarter in which our still beverage portfolio gained or maintained volume and value share in North America.  As we approach the mid-point of our 2020 vision, we remain fully committed to taking the necessary bold actions to realize our vision. One such action is our recently announced global partnership with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters. This partnership is a real game changing innovation in the non-alcoholic beverage category. Consumers are demanding more beverage variety, functionality and convenience. And we believe Green Mountain is the perfect strategic partner to collaborate with and to capitalize on the many transformative opportunities we see available in the marketplace. Importantly for the Coca-Cola Company with this exciting partnership we\u2019re leveraging new technology to create a transformative platform for consumers to enjoy our great brands through new consumption occasions and new channels. By combining Coca-Cola\u2019s brand leadership and global footprint with Green Mountain\u2019s cutting edge technology and innovation capabilities, together we will capitalize on the many exciting opportunities in the single serve pod-based segment of the cold beverage industry as well as explore other future opportunities to collaborate on the entire [current] platform. As evidenced by this recent announcement, our management team is constantly identifying and constantly evaluating creative ways to formulate and fuel the power of partnerships that keep us at the forefront of consumer trends, driving the dynamic global beverage industry. We are fortunate to participate in a global and resilient industry fuelled by a robust long-term demographic trend. We are part of a great business system and unparalleled in its reach and its commitment to invest and we are the stewards of some of the world\u2019s most loved brand. Thus there is no doubt that the lingering effects of the global recession in 2009 have created a challenging environment over the last two years. In addition obesity and ingredient concerns have raised some questions about growth in developed markets. Throughout this time period our Company has consistently delivered on our profit objectives and we will not allow ourselves to become distracted or to make decisions focused on short-term gains. Instead we have thoroughly evaluated what we need to do to accelerate sustainable growth and we\u2019re acting with urgency and decisiveness. Historically we know that when we invest in our brands, commit to near flawless execution and control what we know we can control, we can accelerate our growth. With this in mind we aligned on five strategic priorities to restore our momentum and to keep us on the path to achieve our 2020 vision. These priorities focused on the growth drivers for our system, sparkling beverages, still beverages and global system execution. And on securing and strengthening the financial assuming capital necessary to deliver long-term sustainable growth.  Our five strategic system priorities to restore momentum are; firstly, accelerate sparkling growth led by Coca-Cola; secondly, strategically expanding our profitable still portfolio; third, increasing media investments by maximizing productivity; fourth, winning at the point of sale by unlocking the power of our system; and five, investing in our next generation of [layers].  Let me just spend a few minutes providing some detail on each of these system priorities. First, we will accelerate sparkling growth led by Coca-Cola. There is quite simply no other brand in the world like Coca-Cola, the world\u2019s most universal beverage brand. We are fortunate to be its stewards. And indeed, in many markets around the world, brand Coca-Cola remains magical but we need to work even harder to enhance the romance of the brand in every market around the world. Our global marketing community is laser focused on doing their best work while reallocating resources to the most impactful campaigns and mediums.  A good example of this great work is Share a Coke, which I have referenced several times in my remarks earlier. Since the initial launch of Share a Coke in Australia back in 2011, we've now executed the campaign in 21 other markets. There is -- this is much more than the marketing campaign. In fact, it\u2019s a system-wide collaborative effort to engage consumers in a meaningful and a very authentic Coca-Cola way.  Markets that have launched Share a Coke have experienced increased household penetration, higher immediate consumption volume and improved brand love scores as a direct result of this campaign. This is the kind of marketing that we love to invest in and we look forward to again sharing a Coke with millions of consumers around the world this year. Same time we're working hard to empower our consumers and we're making progress against our four commitments to further contribute to healthier, happier and more active communities. To that end we've placed a special emphasis on innovation efforts to enhance low or no calorie versions of our brand as well as on supporting active healthy living programs all around the world.  Our second priority is to strategically expand our profitable still portfolio. We are the world\u2019s largest still beverage Company with $11 billion still brands and many more in the pipeline. We have shown in juices that when we approach an objective and a goal systematically aligning with our partners, planning from end-to-end, we win and we win big. Today, the Coca-Cola Company is also the world\u2019s largest juice and juice drinks company almost twice the size of our closest competitor. We are the stewards of $4 billion juice and juice drink brands and we are working diligently to raise that number. We're bringing the same disciplined thinking to other categories partnering across our system and across our supply chain to establish a scalable formula for value creation in new categories. This effort involves re-examining every stage of a beverage\u2019s lifecycle and developing category specific plans that balance organic growth, innovation and acquisition. Our third system priority is to increase media investments by maximizing productivity. We are in a business where great marketing works. So, we have committed to increasing our media spending behind our brands by up to $1 billion by 2016. We will fund this increased investment through a combination of supply-chain optimization, system standardization, diligent resource and cost allocation as well as improved utilization of our global marketing network. This incremental productivity goal will further enable us to drive long-term profitable growth and momentum towards realizing our 2020 vision. Gary will share further details about this new opportunity in a few moments.  Our fourth priority is to win at the point of sale by unlocking the power of our global system. Working together with our marketing partners, we are continuously building capabilities and leveraging best practices to improve our execution. In the last four years alone, our system has invested over $50 billion to enhance our competitive position in markets all around the world. As you know execution in the global marketplace is about doing many common things uncommonly well and doing them in an aligned way across our great system. It is about presenting our brands in the right package, in the right outlook, in the right channel, at the right price, cold available and within an arm\u2019s reach of our consumers. This is why we're calling 2014 the year of execution at the point of sale beginning with brand Coca-Cola.  Our final, but perhaps most important priority is to continue to invest in our pipeline of leaders. There is nothing more critical to our business than our people and we have to continue to hire the best, retain the best, train the best, and manage with the best. Our Company and leadership must inspire our people to live our values of focusing on the market, working smart, acting like owners and being passionate ambassadors for our Company and for our brand. As we look forward to 2014 and beyond, we remain very confident in our ability to drive our volume growth trajectory back in line with our long-term growth model. The overall beverage industry remains healthy generating both volume and value growth. Our diverse portfolio of $17 billion brands combined with our unparalleled scale provides us with many opportunities to accelerate market share gains. We have identified opportunities to significantly enhance our productivity initiatives and we made important commitments to increase our brand investment. Consequently, we are no less enthusiastic about the future ahead of us and the beverage industry then when we embark on our 2020 vision back four years ago. With that, let me the turn the call over to Gary.\nGary Fayard: Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning everyone. As Muhtar shared earlier, 2013 presented numerous challenges to our industry and to our business and as a result, our full year volume growth was below our expectations. However, before we put 2013 behind us I wanted to reflect on a few items that I shared with you all at CAGNY last February. Specifically, I\u2019ve talked about how our unwavering focus on long-term value creation for our shareowners and apart from competing in a great industry, there were three specific points I emphasized. First, we are focused on delivering value creating volume growth and despite volume growth being below our expectations in 2013 we delivered full year operating income and EPS growth in line with our long-term growth targets.  Secondly, our goal is to take volume share and although we fell short on volume, we again gained global value share in non-alcoholic ready-to-bring beverages into 2013.  Lastly, I emphasized the critical role that the evolution of our franchise system plays in creating sustainable long-term growth. Our Company and our system made solid progress on this front throughout 2013.  We sold 51% of our Philippines bottling operations to Coca-Cola Thums Up. Our four bottling partners in the greater Tokyo area merged to form Coca-Cola East Japan. Our seven bottling partners in Spain and Portugal merged and the integration of that bottler is underway. We merged our company own bottling operations in Brazil with an independent local bottler to form the second largest bottler in Brazil. And we also continue to advance the system of the future work in North America. Having said that, let\u2019s quickly review a few key drivers of our financial performance this year. Unit case sales and concentrate sales were in line on a consolidated basis in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our comparable currency neutral operating income was up 6% in the quarter and for the full year after excluding the impact of structural items.  Comparable currency neutral earnings per share grew 7% in the quarter and 8% for the full year, and we generated $10.5 billion in cash from operations which was down 1% primarily due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and increase in tax payments and the impact of deconsolidation of bottling operations in the Philippines and Brazil. Now let me take the moment to update everyone on our productivity initiatives before I move to our outlook for 2014. First let me start by saying, we made significant progress on our previously announced productivity and reinvestment programs, in fact I\u2019m pleased to report that by the end of 2013 we have substantially accomplished the objectives of the program and captured the savings associated with those objectives.  Secondly as Muhtar mentioned earlier, we\u2019re expanding our previously announced productivity and reinvestment program to drive an incremental $1 billion in productivity by 2016 that will be redirected primarily in to increased media investments. Our incremental productivity goal consists of two relatively equal components. First, expanded savings through global supply chain optimization data and information technology system standardization and resource and cost reallocation which will be reinvested in global brand building initiatives with an emphasis on increased media spending and also will be increasing the effectiveness of our marketing investments by transforming our marketing and commercial model to redeploy resources into more consumer facing marketing investments to accelerate growth. As we look ahead to 2014, let me take a minute to update you on a few outlook items as you model our business. After considering our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of prior year rates, we partly expect a currency headwind at the operating income of approximately 10 points in the first quarter of 2014 and seven points for the full year.  In terms of coverage, we\u2019re fully hedged on the euro and the yen, almost totally covered on sterling and also have near term coverage in place across several other major currencies.  We anticipate that operating leverage on a currency neutral basis will be flat to slightly positive. We expect net interest income will contribute roughly equivalent of penny per share to our full year 2014 earnings per share and will be evenly distributed throughout the year. We expect the tax rate for 2014 to hold steady at approximately 23%.  With respect to structural items, we\u2019ll be still cycling the impact of some bottling divestitures during the first six months of 2014 and even though these structural items will not have a significant impact on earnings per share, they will result in a one point headwind at both net revenue and operating income for the full year. To be clear, our 2014 outlook for the impact of structural items does not include the potential impact of refranchising bottling assets in North America related to our system of the future work. We will continue to provide updates as we move forward throughout the year.  As for cash, as I\u2019ve shared with you over the years, we utilize a very disciplined and consistent framework, first we reinvest in the business which includes making the necessary investments to strengthen our brands to accelerate growth. It also includes capital investments which we expect to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion this year.  Second, we reward share owners by paying a healthy dividend, we\u2019ve increased our dividend every year for more than half a century and we will recommend another increase in the dividend this year at our Board meeting this week.  Next, we evaluate opportunities to grow through acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures. We do these as enablers to help accelerate growth when appropriate and where there is a need within our existing portfolio.  And finally we put what\u2019s left over into share repurchase, in 2014 we expect share repurchases to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion. Although our 2014 outlook for net share repurchase is below 2013, I would remind everyone that our 2013 buybacks represented a 15% increase from the prior year and was partially funded by cash inflows related to bottling divestitures.  Also given the forecasted exchange headwinds in 2014, we believe this is the right approach and we\u2019ll obviously continue to update you as we move forward throughout the year.  In terms of quarterly saving our first quarter in 2014 will have one less selling day and our fourth quarter will have one additional selling day. In addition we expect the impact of the Easter holiday to fully benefit the second quarter of 2014 and we\u2019ll be cycling the reversal of certain expenses related to long term compensation in the first and second quarters of 2014.  In closing we continue to be focused on doing the right things for the health of our business and to ensure we can deliver sustainable long term growth to create value for our shareowners. I believe our Company and our system are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities within our great industry. I look forward to seeing many of you at CAGNY later this week and at CAGE in March.  Operator, we\u2019re now ready for your -- for questions. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Bill Schmidt from Deutsche Bank. \nBill Schmidt - Deutsche Bank:  Hi, good morning, can you guys talk about, through the outlook geography by geography and then maybe how the pace of growth is going to differ between volume and pricing given some of the big currency moves and also obviously the tax in Mexico and I have a follow up if I could. \nMuhtar Kent:  Sure Bill, good morning, this is Muhtar. Let me just first just take a step back and just say that in a way we\u2019ve had a speed bump we know that would have come on our road to 2020. We dealt with commodities in 2011 and \u201912, volatility in weather has become a norm, uncertain economies, internal also execution issues caused us to underperform versus our expectations in 2013, I\u2019ll start with -- by saying that.  We have looked at everything, we\u2019ve looked at our people, priorities, marketing, selling and innovation and we have refreshed our plans, and with a simple but scales offset of priorities on marketing our brands, system execution by our franchisees and bottling partners and Company owned bottlers and on innovation of all kinds, business models like the one that you -- we\u2019ve recently announced with Green Mountain, brands, equipment, packaging, the lot.  Our long term outlook is our performance algorithm which we have and will deliver going forward and 2014 will be a year of steady improvement as we get back up to speed. But make no mistake, our leadership team is confident, accountable, our system will market well, we will sell well and we are going to achieve our 2020 vision. Now let me just take you through a quick tour of the world, and I will ask Ahmet also to comment.  Starting with Asia, I think China is going to sustain its growth. India, in terms of its macroeconomic outlook, and I think we will continue to benefit from that. In India I think there's election coming up and usually when there are elections, there\u2019s a little bit of easing of fiscal discipline, I think that will play into a little bit of added disposable incomes. In South-East Asia certainly we've seen quite a lot of political turmoil especially in Thailand. I think that will, as we go into 2014, my expectation is that that will ease a little bit. Indonesia, also there\u2019s an election coming up, but I think Indonesia is certainly having some macroeconomic issues that will probably continue into 2014. And then Philippines, I think we'll see some slightly improved outlook in the Philippines versus 2013. In Japan, I think obviously everyone is looking very closely at the new policies of the Prime Minister and his government. There\u2019s a new tax coming up, but we\u2019ll see how that impacts but certainly we all feel that are operating in Japan feel that there is some hope for a little bit of more inflation in the economy that will benefit also businesses like ours, although recently then last economic numbers from Japan were a little bit below expectations. And in Africa, youngest continent, we\u2019re very well positioned and we feel that we will continue to grow well in the years to come in the African continent and benefit from also improvements in governance across the whole continent.  And in Eurasia, there is elections coming up in Turkey. Lots of, again, political issues in the Middle East will continue. And Russia I think, all Russians can be very proud of the Olympics that are taking place. And I think that we will, as we move forward, as [our eyes are now] there in Russia looking at some of the great activations that we've had in our business. And I think Russia our business will continue to grow, in Russia with all the investments that we are making with our bottling partners. Europe is a tale of -- continued tale of two cities. It\u2019s like a phase of seven zones, I think the high unemployment and low growth is going to continue but it\u2019s not going to get worse. As far as Northern Europe, Britain is certainly ahead of all the other economies in terms of the growth outlook. And I think Germany also is in that area. We will continue to benefit from the robustness of policies in those two economies and the rest of the continent is somewhat behind Germany and England. And in Latin America, again, 2014 is going to be year leading into an election, in early 2015. We'll have also the benefit of the World Cup, and our biggest [February activation] globally on the World Cup. And Southern Cone, Argentina, Chile; we should continue to see the benefit of all the programs we have in place and also continued inflation environment in those two areas. And Mexico I think, President Pena Nieto\u2019s programs are taking effect over the reforms, both long-term I think that is a benefit to our business, to the economy, to the people of Mexico. And again as I said in my commentary, it's too early to say about the impact of the price increase we've had there. So I hope that that gives you a good tour of the world.  And then finally in terms of our flagship market in the United States, clearly the best right now as far as we can see, the best western developed economy in the world we think we will see slightly improved mobility in the United States in 2014 versus 2013. And we hope that will also mean a little bit of increased spending for consumer products as we go into 2014. And again we will benefit from all the robustness in our marketing program and our increased expenditure and quality of marketing as we move into 2014 for our flagship market.  Ahmet, you want to add some commentary?\nAhmet Bozer: Yes. I will add few things, I guess, to really compare some of these issues that have existed even last year, how they are different now? For example emerging market currencies; when the first news on discontinuation of [paper] came out last year around May or June; there was a bit of a shock in emerging markets. We see that over the last seven or eight months these emerging markets are sort of finding ways to deal with it, by no means it\u2019s certain, by no means it\u2019s perfect. But it certainly feels a little bit more under control compared to when it first came up and the interest rate and things like that have been baked into those expectations. So, I guess the message there is countries and our business we're finding ways to deal with that new reality of less liquidity coming out of United States. I would just add Muhtar to your comment on Europe north south divide, that is very much true but we are sort of beginning to see sort of different shades of grey in the south as well. There are some encouraging signs in Spain, sort of less so in Italy at this point in time although there is a new Prime Minister there and we\u2019re hopeful with the new programs to be announced if they are. And the Eastern Europe, it continues to struggle in terms of consumer confidence and economic. So north continues to do well and south is even showing different performance now.  The other point that Muhtar mentioned is political uncertainty, it's another common thing to many of our emerging markets. They eventually could impact the economic realities but again so far in countries like Turkey and Thailand it\u2019s been fine. And let me just in the interest of giving time to other questions, let me just stop it here.\nMuhtar Kent: Sandy, do you want to add any commentary to North America. I think it\u2019s important to say in North America that we believe in the North American market, we believe in the demographics, we believe this is a growth market; we have grown in all but two quarters of the last 15 quarters in the United States. We believe we can do better and we\u2019re intent and thus we\u2019ll be focused on achieving that. Sandy?\nSandy Douglas: Yes. Thanks Muhtar. We have a great business in North America and our focus in accelerating the business is on our brands, on our customers and on our capability. And I\u2019m really happy to be working with Irial and Paul and our all of our U.S. bottlers. I think Irial and Paul bring a tremendous amount of selling and executional energy that will help us build on our momentum.  On my end, over the last six to seven weeks, Paul and I have met with our major customers. We\u2019ve met with our bottlers and we\u2019ve gone through the brand plant in detail looking at opportunities to focus and strengthen them and to move resources to emphasize advertising and brand building on our largest brands. And I think with the plan in place our focus as a system Irial, Paul and I, and our bottlers is to improve all aspects of our execution, whether it\u2019s marketing or sales or in the marketplace. And we believe as a result of that that we will improve steadily over time and we share the confidence that Muhtar expressed in the long term health of North America. It\u2019s a great market. It will grow. And I think we can be confident about our long term future there.\nOperator: And our next question is from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. \nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: Just a follow up to Bill\u2019s question. I guess if we think about 2014 there is a lot of moving parts with exchange rates and some of the volatility in emerging markets. Maybe Gary could you talk a little bit about how we should think about currency neutral and also maybe sort of neutral of the effects of structural change? Are you still looking at a currency neutral sort of on-algorithm year in operating profits? And also just some of the other major drivers behind volume that might influence that cost of goods sold inflation, price mix, country mix that sort of thing? I think that would be helpful.\nGary Fayard: Yes. Bryan thanks and let me say back and go through all of those. So, let me start at the top, when you\u2019re the industry leader you have to believe in rational pricing and believe we should get pricing for our brands because our brands are worth it and we would expect to have positive price mix this year to go with the volume that we\u2019ll have this year. When you look at commodity, it\u2019s fairly benign from what we\u2019re saying for 2014 so not a big deal. But now the currency among the worst we\u2019ve seen in years and there is not a whole lot you can do about it when all the emerging market currencies kind of melt down as they did earlier at the end of December or early January. But with that said, let me be very clear, ours is a growth business, is a business model that is built on growth and we know that we cannot save our way to prosperity. We will have productivity but that productivity will be reinvested for growth and while we are reinvesting for growth in our marketing, we have our goals are also in addition while we\u2019re increasing the marketing we will also have a goal and is a goal up for this year up hitting our long term growth model this year. So we\u2019re going to significantly increase our marketing but at the same time the goal is we will hit long term growth model this year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from John Faucher from JPMorgan.\nJohn Faucher : Thanks, just one quick follow up to Gary\u2019s question and then a question for Muhtar or Gary\u2019s answer rather. Gary, does that include a Mexico impact in hitting your long-term algorithm in 2014?  And then Muhtar, responding to Gary\u2019s question about ramping up the marketing, I guess how do we view, there is a sense out there in the market that given the headwinds for the category that adding more marketing could be sort of pushing on a string so to speak. So what is it that you are seeing that says these headwinds that you are facing can be offset with higher marketing? Thanks.\nJPMorgan: Thanks, just one quick follow up to Gary\u2019s question and then a question for Muhtar or Gary\u2019s answer rather. Gary, does that include a Mexico impact in hitting your long-term algorithm in 2014?  And then Muhtar, responding to Gary\u2019s question about ramping up the marketing, I guess how do we view, there is a sense out there in the market that given the headwinds for the category that adding more marketing could be sort of pushing on a string so to speak. So what is it that you are seeing that says these headwinds that you are facing can be offset with higher marketing? Thanks.\nGary Fayard:  John its Gary, thanks for the question. First as Muhtar said in the prepared remarks, it's too early to tell what\u2019s going to happen in Mexico. We have planned around Mexico of what we believe is the most likely day. But we have a portfolio of brands that are marketed and sold across 200 countries and our job is to manage that portfolio. So unless something unforeseen should happen, I think the answer has to be yes, it includes what could happen to Mexico, if that changes, we\u2019ll update you obviously, but we\u2019re going -- what we believe would happen today.\nMuhtar Kent:  And just add to Gary\u2019s answer and to the second part of your question John, I\u2019ll just tell you very simply that the Coca-Cola way is to grow our way to success and we invest for growth together with our [bumping] partners and we have great -- the greatest system in the world and we have had tremendous amount of experience to say that a good marketing, good selling works for our business and it will work for our business. We have numerous cases to prove that and we\u2019re going to continue to build on our marketing in both quantity and quality. This is a global increase in marketing and in every country that we operate in large or small, we know it works and when we invest in marketing, our global partners invest and feed on the street, in more coolers in more trucks, and more line and that\u2019s what we see happening and that\u2019s what we will see we believe happening to our business as we restore steady momentum in through 2014 and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.\nJudy Hong :  Just a few questions, first, just the North America Gary, the profitability decline in fourth quarter was pretty surprising. So maybe you could give us a little bit of color in terms of the components of the profits decline in North America.  And just broadly in North America from a profitability perspective, the business hasn\u2019t really grown since the acquisition of the bottler. So as you think about the next couple of years, thinking about the refranchising opportunities and all the productivity savings, are we at a point where we can actually see growth in this business from a profitability perspective in 2014? Or is this more of a transition year or so with the investment that\u2019s going on?\n Goldman Sachs:  Just a few questions, first, just the North America Gary, the profitability decline in fourth quarter was pretty surprising. So maybe you could give us a little bit of color in terms of the components of the profits decline in North America.  And just broadly in North America from a profitability perspective, the business hasn\u2019t really grown since the acquisition of the bottler. So as you think about the next couple of years, thinking about the refranchising opportunities and all the productivity savings, are we at a point where we can actually see growth in this business from a profitability perspective in 2014? Or is this more of a transition year or so with the investment that\u2019s going on?\nGary Fayard: Judy its Gary, let me take the first part of that question. On the fourth quarter profit -- operating profit decline, it was down 12% I think in the fourth quarter. And by the way I know the answer to this one specifically, because I asked the same question some time back, and got into my new detail on it. And 100% of that change is because of -- it's an all in OpEx or primarily all in OpEx and it\u2019s what we\u2019re cycling from 2012, there were some incentive compensation, accrual reversals in the fourth quarter of 2012 that did not happen in 2013 and that cycling caused a significant change in OpEx swing year-on-year in the fourth quarter only and it\u2019s what swung North America to that 12% operating income loss. So I think it\u2019s much more reasonable to actually look at North America, look at it for the full year and you will get a better picture of actual performance versus the fourth quarter. When you look at the full year then you will see -- that is where we\u2019ve got some challenges as Muhtar said around volume and particularly in sparkling around diets and lights but that\u2019s what we are specifically on.\nMuhtar Kent: Just let me add to in terms of the outlook and that is that as I said we are confident about and excited about first our performance algorithm worldwide but also in terms of steady improvement as we get back up to speed in the United States. And I think that that will -- when we start restoring the momentum in the United States which we believe is going to happen, well that will also bring the results in the -- financial results that we will be happier with as we move into 2014 and beyond. It\u2019s going to take a while, this is not a fix -- an immediate fix but we know that it\u2019s going to be a steady improvement.\nJudy Hong : And just in terms of the media investments, is there any color you can give us in terms of the breakdown by regions, by categories, is North America likely to get the proportionate amount in terms of the media spending increase in 2014?\n Goldman Sachs: And just in terms of the media investments, is there any color you can give us in terms of the breakdown by regions, by categories, is North America likely to get the proportionate amount in terms of the media spending increase in 2014?\nMuhtar Kent:  Can\u2019t give you the specifics on the geographic mix Judy, but as we announced it\u2019s about $1 billion by 2016 and it is a global number. And again there will be a good distribution and we will be again also looking and tracking through franchise leadership, resulting also system increase and investments in all the key markets.\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question is from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley:  Hi, I also wanted to touch on profit in North America. It sounds like in 2013, you view the profit challenges as more driven from a volume perspective but given the diet soft drink where you seem to be more secular around longer term health concerns, I am just wondering if going forward you may manage more for profitability and lean more on pricing than driving volume growth. Is there any change as you look at the algorithm between pricing and volume and which metric you will focus on going forward?\nMuhtar Kent:  Thanks, Dara. Sandy you want to take it and then [indiscernible] if you want to comment.\nSandy Douglas:  Yes, I think the key to the North America growth algorithm is investing in our brands and our feet on the street and a key element to that is getting our pricing, so that we can have the revenue to be able to reinvest in sustainable growth. Where we had issues over the years in my experience in North America is when we did not get the price we needed, when our marketing execution was not what it needed to be and therefore the feet on the street started to get reduced and ultimately it hurt sustainable growth.  Our plan going forward and it\u2019s going to take some time and we're focused on improving it, is to make sure that we get the price and that we execute the marketing well and feed the feet on the street which creates the virtuous cycle in the United States just like it does around the world. [Gary] do you want to add to that?\nUnidentified Company Representative: I guess the only comment I would say, Muhtar already mentioned that we are an industry leader and industry leaders have to set the tone in terms of price, in terms of how to market their brands in any given market. And actually 50 days, in less than 50 days into my new involvement in North America, I am really excited about the future. I am excited about the enthusiasm, the passion of our people. Our job, mine, Paul\u2019s, Sandy\u2019s is really is to make sure that excitement translates into performance and into results. And as Sandy said, it\u2019s not going to happen overnight but I feel we've already started on the journey and over the next quarters, the next couple of years, you will see very positive momentum in our market in North America.\nDara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley:  And then move to our post the investment in Green Mountain, I was just hoping to get an update on how important a role acquisitions might play in meeting your 2020 vision goals? You mentioned the focus on partnerships earlier in the call, I was hoping you could elaborate there and if acquisitions are greater priority here given some of the difficult macro-conditions and somewhat favourable environment with your healthy balance sheet and still lower rate here.\nMuhtar Kent:  Look, nothing different than before, so no change. I think we're obviously very excited with the new opportunities for consumption as will be brought to us by the partnership with Green Mountain over time. I think the key is to feel the power of partnerships. The Coca-Cola Company and System is an incredible integration of power of partnerships in every respect and therefore this is yet another one. And so think about if you look at household consumptions in particularly, Western markets, there is a tremendous opportunity to gain incremental consumption occasions for our brand through these kind of partnerships and this is what the Green Mountain partnership is all about.  When you look at how beverages are consumed at home and when you look at trends in the next 10 years, people are going to spend more time at home. They are going to work more from home. Home is going to be an even more important place for people for consumers and I think we need to present there with different technologies, different packaging, different ways to serve our brands and that\u2019s why this is important and partnerships like these are going to be important for us over time going forward. And so, our thinking has not really evolved or changed in terms of bolt-on acquisitions, if we see opportunities, we will get them like InneSense like [Ocean] and so forth. And we will continue to seek new power of partnerships, to leverage new power of partnerships also going into the remaining part of our 2020 vision for the next six years.\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein:  So I guess the frustration I am hearing from many investors and a lot of questions on this call, is that there is a feeling that the Company isn\u2019t doing enough to change itself despite that the world around it has really changed and many like us we secularly, to sort of continued emphasis on the Coca-Cola way in history which is respectable in volumes, market shares, and even more marketing blaming short-term externalities but it\u2019s been a little while now that we\u2019ve seen tougher volumes, North America will profit continue to shrink, there is only $1 billion cost savings when some competitors are doing more from a pro rata basis. There is limited movement on refranchising and help innovation so far. So I guess might the company ever believe that it needs to focus on new levers of shareholder value creation like pricing up even more lower promotions, massive cost cutting, big portfolio innovation change and indeed returning more cash to shareholders. So, I know there\u2019s lots there but should investors expect bigger bolder change that pay out to meet this truly different world and so what specifically should we be looking for to just kind of sharing your confidence about the story or should we just expect kind of same status quo going forward?\nMuhtar Kent: First, Ali I disagree with you. I think we have a great portfolio brand, we have a great system, the best consumer product system in the world and I believe that our programs will work and had worked. We have significantly outperformed and grown since 2012 and yes we\u2019ve had speed bump and certainly that makes us even more focused and more resolute to continue on our road to 2020. And I think that we have -- I will share at CAGNY on Friday the real reasons why we believe in our future and so that\u2019s all I would say.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein: But I don\u2019t disagree with you about the strength of the brands at all actually, Muhtar. And I don\u2019t disagree with you about the strength of the system. I\u2019m just looking the results and I\u2019m trying to figure out whether enough is changing, enough is different and whether you guys do actually view the world is different enough and [indiscernible] but I actually don\u2019t disagree with you.\nMuhtar Kent: I understand and I understand it\u2019s easy for people to have very short memories but we have the experience and we know what we are doing and we will continue to do what we believe and we are focused and we will execute the best and we will achieve our 2020 vision, that\u2019s what this is all about. So that\u2019s what I would say and we have talked about pricing, you\u2019ve heard all colleagues also talked about pricing and I think we don\u2019t want to repeat ourselves.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thank you Gary, Ahmet, Sandy, Irial and Jackson, we\u2019ve delivered sound full year financial results. We\u2019re implementing the strategic actions that will enable us to restore momentum in 2014 and we see many reasons to believe that we can accelerate our growth over time, achieve our long-term growth model targets and realize our 2020 vision. Our global beverage industry is healthy, the trends that have historically fuelled this, continue to be strong and our global systems commitment and reach are unparalleled. This commitment has never wavered and the strategic decision that we have made over recent years have not only enabled us to deliver solid financial results that also advanced our competitive position, enhanced our capabilities and strengthened our result as a global system to achieve our 2020 vision. That is our promise to our investors, to our customers, to our consumers and the daily objective of the more than 700,000 associates of The Coca Cola system all around the world. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our Company and for joining us this morning.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude today\u2019s conference.

These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Please look on our website for this information. Now, let me turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. We delivered sequential volume growth in the third quarter while capturing global non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage value share for the 25th consecutive quarter. We gained volume and value share across core sparkling, juice and juice drinks, sports drinks and ready-to-drink teas. Importantly, we were able to do this in combination with a 2% increase in price mix.  Excluding the impact of structural items, we generated comparable currency neutral net revenue growth of 4% and strong operating income growth of 8%. Our broad diversified product portfolio, the disciplined approach to extracting and reinvesting savings and our global geographic reach are enabling us to effectively navigate a still uncertain macroeconomic environment. History has taught us that when we invest through difficult times, we emerge even stronger. This quarter our system delivered the highest number of servings ever reported in the third quarter both for brand Coca-Cola and across our portfolio. In all, we delivered 181 billion servings thanks to global volume growth of 2% driven by 2% global growth in brand Coca-Cola. This record number of servings speaks not only to our systems worldwide strength, but also to the opportunities ahead of us as we engaged with the next-generation of global consumers. Our global still brands also delivered solid results, growing 3% and gaining global value share. These third quarter results bring our year-to-date volume growth to 2% cycling 5%. In line with our expectations for the third quarter, we delivered sequential volume growth in many key markets including North America, China, India and regions across Europe. That said, clearly the global economy remains challenged as noted by the International Monetary Fund last week, which trimmed this forecast for global output for the sixth time since early last year. And as we have all noted, emerging markets have become increasingly more volatile further exacerbating a challenging global landscape. Hence, disposable income and consumer spending have become challenged and consequently have impacted the overall growth of the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink industry. Yet, despite these ongoing headwinds, our business remains healthy and we continue to invest in the strength of our brands. We are fully implementing our productivity and reinvestment plans and together with our global bottling partners we continue to advance our system. All of this leads us to remain confident in our ability to drive our volume growth trajectory back in line with our long-term growth model over time. Looking first to our operations in North America, brand Coca-Cola grew an impressive 2% in the quarter, leading our total beverage portfolio to 2% growth on top of 2% growth in the prior quarter -- in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date volume growth in North America is even as we cycled 2%. Sparkling beverages were even in the quarter with sparkling price mix increasing 1%. Year-to-date, sparkling price mix is up 2% as we remained committed to a rational pricing environment. We also remained focused on consistent investments in packaging innovation, in immediate consumption growth and increased teen recruitment, all of which are yielding positive results. Specifically, packages like the 1.25 liter and mini packs -- mini can packs have increased our household base by more than 1.8 million in the last year. In addition, Coca-Cola has generated over $19 million incremental immediate consumption transactions year-to-date and importantly, Coca-Cola remains the most preferred beverage brand amongst teens by 2 to 1 margin. Still beverage volume grew a solid 5%, with volume and value share gains across the energy, juice and juice drinks, water and tea categories. In sports drinks we gained volume share while maintaining value share. As these results indicate, our revenue growth management strategies are working and enabling our system to provide consumers the brand they love, the convenience that they crave and the value that they need, while also expanding our topline. We continue to outperform the industry, gaining volume and value share across both sparkling and still categories. I\u2019m also pleased to share that we are making progress on the evolution of our North America system as our North America team continues to advance discussions with existing and prospective partners who are eager to be part of this dynamic franchise system. Turning now to Latin America, our volume growth was even in the third quarter, cycling 5% growth and coupled with a double-digit increase in price mix, due primarily to continued and disciplined focus on price and pack architecture enhancements, as well as inflationary environments in some markets. Across the region we gained non-alcoholic ready-to-drink volume share, making this the 25th consecutive quarter that we maintained or gained volume share. Similar to what we have experienced in other markets, we are seeing a slowdown in economic growth in Mexico and Brazil. Falling GDP growth rates have led to slower growth rates in personal consumption and consequently in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. As in other instances where we have witnessed economic slowdowns in recent years, we are expanding our marketing efforts, while actively working with our bottling partners to invest in these markets and to offer consumers attractive price pack combination. Examples include the expansion of returnable glass bottle distribution and initiatives to ensure affordability tied to magic price points. Outside of Mexico and Brazil, we experienced solid performance with volume growth of 4% in the quarter.  Moving on now to Europe, we again witnessed diverging results with 3% volume growth in Northern European countries, offset by a 5% volume decline in countries that make up Central and South Europe for a net decline of 1% in our European business in the third quarter. In spite of this challenging environment, we gained volume share in core sparkling across the entire continent while continuing to strengthen our competitive positions across the non alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry in our Central and Southern European business unit. Price mix increased 8% in the quarter, including the impact of the consolidation of Innocent. Our Share a Coke campaign was extremely well received. We placed over 2.5 billion customized packages into the market to drive team recruitment and further bolster immediate consumption. Lastly, our operations in Germany continued to perform well delivering 3% growth in the quarter cycling 3%. This performance was fuelled by high single digit growth in brand Coca-Cola and double-digit Coke Zero growth. Sprite and Fanta also contributed to growth in the quarter in Europe.  The Eurasia and Africa group grew 4%, cycling 11% as we maintained focus on broadening distribution, honing our marketing efforts and strengthening brand loyalty in the more than 80 countries that make up our business in this dynamic region. Volume growth grew 4% led by brand Coca-Cola which grew 3% and Sprite which grew 4%. Still beverage volume grew 3% in the quarter. The Eurasia and Africa group maintained volume share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages while growing volume share in sparkling beverages and juice and juice drinks. Both the Middle East and North Africa business unit and the Central East and West Africa business unit maintained their strong first half volume performance in the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, the Eurasia and Africa group is up high single digits, cycling 10% growth and has been an important contributor to our year-to-date performance. Our Pacific group delivered 5% growth in the quarter improving sequentially from the second quarter and cycling 4% from the prior year quarter. Sparkling beverages led with 5% growth as Brand Coca-Cola delivered 7% growth and Sprite grew 5%. Still beverage volume also grew 5% in the quarter, while cycling 7% growth.  As noted, our second -- as noted during our second quarter call, we anticipated a better second half of the year in China and I'm pleased to report that we were able to deliver 9% volume growth in the quarter, led by 8% growth in sparkling beverages. Earlier this year, we began to evolve our strategies in China to reflect the current economic and competitive environment and also to position ourselves for continued sustainable profit growth. Our business in India delivered 6% growth in the quarter, cycling double digits. We achieved this growth while increasing prices across our juice brands to offset higher cost of goods. In addition, volume grew by strong double digits through September once the impact of the extended monsoon abated. Brand Coca-Cola again led the way with 22% growth in the quarter. We are pleased with these results and with our solid volume and value share gains across sparkling and still beverages in India. Looking ahead, we have strong marketing programs planned for the fourth quarter of this year and into next year. I'm particularly excited about two iconic marketing programs that will ignite consumer passions across key markets. Specifically, the Olympic Torch relay recently started [ph] from Asian Olympia as it begins its relay journey across Russia. And the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour is also underway with stops planned in 89 countries where passions for football run high. Further, throughout our company's history we've always been at the forefront of cultural change in forming the conversation, inspiring our youth to act and bringing resources to our local communities all across the world. This legacy has sprained our thinking about forging effective and lasting partnerships, creating shared value, making a positive societal difference in areas that are of critical importance to our business specifically water, woman and wellbeing. Returning to our global performance, we benefited from marked sequential improvement in several key markets. We achieved robust and widespread growth of our flagship brand and we delivered solid financial results. Our efforts to enhance the health of our system are working as evidenced by our broad based growth improving execution and strong cash generation. At the same time, we also acknowledged that we have more work to do as we will no doubt face headwinds as we work towards our 2020 vision. Nevertheless the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry is a vibrant and rewarding business to compete in and our business has consistently grown. And I can assure you that underlying forces that shaped our 2020 vision just a few years ago remains very much intact today. Together with our global system partners, our roadmap is enabling us to strategically invest both through good times and challenging times to deliver long-term sustainable performance. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Gary.\nGary P. Fayard: Thanks Muhtar and good morning everyone. Our third quarter results underscore several key points. First, the global economy is still struggling to recover with increasing volatility across emerging markets. Second, slowing economic growth clearly impacted consumer spending and overall non-alcoholic ready-to-drink industry growth in the quarter. And third, in spite of these macro trends, our strategies and solid execution enabled us to once again capture global value share and to deliver solid financial performance. As Muhtar said we grew our global volume 2% in the quarter while at the same time delivering solid financial results. While we\u2019re pleased with this sequential volume improvement, we remained focused on further advancing our volume growth trajectory over time.  Concentrate sales were slightly below unit case volume growth in the quarter but we\u2019re in line with unit case sales year-to-date. Moving onto our financial results, each of our geographic operating units contributed to comparable currency neutral operating income growth in the quarter. Comparable currency neutral net revenues were even both in the quarter and year-to-date, excluding the impact of structural items, this would primarily be the Philippines and Brazil bottler, net revenues increased 4% for the quarter and 3% year-to-date. We realized a healthy 2% global price mix for the quarter and 1% price mix year-to-date. Importantly, year-to-date price mix was positive across each of our geographies with the exception of the Pacific due to geographic mix. Also as you know, we consolidated the Innocent brands in Europe which helped our price mix in the quarter but just to be clear our global price mix was 2% without the Innocent brands benefit. As expected, our gross margins moderated somewhat this quarter due to geographic mix. We expect our full-year gross margins to be relatively in line with our year-to-date comparable gross margins. Excluding the impact of structural items, we achieved five points of favorable operating expense leverage for the quarter while we continued to support our brands through increased marketing investments. Our operating expense leverage now stands at three points year-to-date and we expect low single digit leverage for the full year. As a reminder, we are cycling the reversal of expenses related to one of our long-term incentive plans in the fourth quarter of last year. Our comparable currency neutral operating income was up 7% this quarter and 5% year-to-date, excluding the impact of the structural items, operating income grew 8% in the quarter and 6% year-to-date. Therefore we now expect our full-year operating income to be generally in line with our year-to-date performance. On a comparable basis, the impact of currency was a 5% headwind on this quarter\u2019s operating income results, a full point more than we expected due to the -- and this is due to the weakening of many of the emerging market currencies. We now anticipate continued currency headwinds will have an unfavourable impact on the operating income in the 5% to 6% range in the fourth quarter.  Comparable earnings per share grew 4% in the third quarter, despite currency headwinds of about 5%. Year-to-date comparable earnings per share also grew 4%, despite headwinds from currency of about 4%. We generated $7.7 billion in cash from operations year-to-date and have repurchased $2.7 billion of our shares in line with our plans to repurchase $3 billion to $3.5 billion this year. Equity income came in lower than in the prior year quarter due to the ongoing challenging macroeconomic conditions around the world. We expect equity income will continue to be impacted by these factors.  Let me now provide you just with a couple of reminders as we look through the balance of the year. Looking forward as mentioned in our second quarter earning call, we anticipate that bottling transactions, including the impact of the deconsolidation of our Brazilian bottling operations early in the third quarter, will have a 3% structural impact on our full year 2013 net revenues. Likewise, our full year operating income results should see a 1% negative structural impact. In closing, we are strategically navigating through these challenging macroeconomic times, investing in our business to steadily strengthen our competitive position and to drive balanced growth and long term sustainable performance. Operator, we\u2019re now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley: Good morning. Muhtar, I was hoping for more granularity on emerging markets given the Q3 slowdown, particularly in Latin America, which was in contrast to some improvement we saw in China and India. So can you give us an update on macro environment as you look around the world and also some of the strategies you mentioned you were implementing, are you gaining traction at this point from a market share standpoint and should we expect to see volume performance in emerging markets improve as we look out going forward from here?\nMuhtar Kent: Yes, Dara good morning. Now I think first, it\u2019s important to realize that there are different timings across the world to some of the volatility in macroeconomics and particularly what's interesting for us which is disposable incomes. So I think China has already had a slowdown and is beginning to recover. We see that and there\u2019s always also a lag between GDP, per capita and disposable income. So also important to realize that they don\u2019t all happen at the same time. The numbers don\u2019t correspond to each other one to one. And so we do see an improvement in Southeast Asia, and parts of certainly China where things have stabilized and things \u2013 people are beginning to normalize their sort of habits. And in the last sort of three, four months we\u2019re seeing a flight of currency from emerging markets, market stock exchanges in countries back into North America, that\u2019s had an impact on disposable incomes in Latin America, in Eurasia, in countries like Turkey and other countries \u2013 and certain other countries in North Africa. So yes, those are \u2013 and you can track stock exchange indexes and you can track disposable income growth or slowdown. They are all very related and we do see that the world is not just one city or one sort of element of volatility.  There are different pockets of volatility happening at the same time. And what we are fortunate with is a great portfolio, a wonderful portfolio where India slows down, maybe seven, eight, nine months ago, it\u2019s coming \u2013 we see some comeback in terms of disposable incomes I\u2019m talking about and China is the same, Southeast Asia, ASEAN similar, Philippines also pretty much in that camp and then, we certainly also see that we still got some headwinds maybe in other parts of the world. So there are some tailwinds coming and some headwinds coming, and we continue to invest in our brands. And when you look at our performance, we have sequential improvement in many parts of the world, particularly when you look at places like India, places like China, ASEAN, even also developed markets such as Australia and also South Africa. And our African continent, I haven\u2019t mentioned that countries that are in Sub-Saharan Africa that are usually sort of south of 80 per capita, again grew in a very healthy manner this past quarter about 5% up and we expect Africa to continue to generate a good results and economies in Africa seem to be pretty buoyant and seem not to be too impacted. But of course, they are at a very slow level of their per capita development as well. I hope that helps.\nDara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley: Yes. That\u2019s helpful. And then some of the strategies you are implementing, do you think, it is helping to drive an improvement in market growth at all or drive market share gains and do you feel comfortable that emerging market trends have bottomed in general at this point and we should see some improvement going forward or is it still too volatile to call right now?\nAhmet Bozer: I think, it\u2019s pretty, as I said, different pockets showing different results, but we have a very, very sharp focus on, I was down in Latin America recently, a month ago. I have visited many countries in Africa recently, as well as in Asia. That we have an incredibly sharp focus on brand price pack channel architecture, new price points, lower price points, more focus on affordability, more focus on returnable packs and smaller packs, individual packs, that helped continue to keep the drinkers base growing, which is key and essential to when economies also start turning up and when disposable income start heading north.\nDara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Pecoriello from Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.\nBill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research: Good morning, everybody.\nMuhtar Kent: Good morning.\nBill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research: Muhtar, critics have said that Coke\u2019s growth story is over and reflected in the stock price pointing to the slowing emerging market growth you were just talking about, declines in Diet soft drinks, some say the pricing in U.S. is irrational and inability to grow in big markets like U.S. and Mexico? Could you explain why you still see solid growth ahead for the company and what the company is doing in terms of innovation, productivity, you mentioned price pack earlier to drive that growth and why the critics who declared the growth story is over are wrong? Thanks.\nMuhtar Kent: Yeah. Thanks, Bill. First, philosophically, from a strategic point -- vantage point, the whole story of balanced growth we believe is still very intact, balance being growth in western markets, growth in emerging markets, balance being growth in sparkling and growth in still beverages and you see that happening in this past quarters as well. So we have grown in markets like United States, which we believe is a long-term growth market and when you think about it 14 of the last -- of the last 14 consecutive quarters, we have grown in all but one of them and now we have generated again 2% growth with 2% growth of brand Coca-Cola. So we, Australia grew, many important markets in Western Europe grew, Germany grew again 3%, countries in Northwest Europe generated good healthy growth for us. So, and then emerging markets. Yes, there are some headwinds that are happening in emerging markets but we believe they are very temporary. The whole demographic, the whole investment, the whole story of 1 billion new middle class still holds very strong in our opinion by 2020 over this last -- this past decade that we are in, this decade that we are in, a 1 billion new middle class, that bodes very well for our - the industry we are in and we believe we can continue to generate very healthy good growth. We believe we can continue to generate very healthy price earnings -- I mean, I'm sorry, price mix and we believe that therefore like in this past quarter, which was where we did see a lot of headwinds, we generated 4% revenue growth and 8% currency neutral operating income growth. And we believe that there is -- we had a lot of headwinds. So as economies begin to move, I think, we will see a lot of improvement. I\u2019ll now ask Ahmet as well to make some comments on this and if need be also ask Steve to add his commentary. \nAhmet Bozer: Bill, you mentioned a few items, I will just focus on a couple of them. Emerging markets as you would know if you look at the history that it goes through cycles. So it has a cycle of years and years of growth and every now and then you have economic headwinds and you managed through that. But the emerging growth \u2013 emerging market growth economically certainly isn\u2019t over and we have a formula which pretty much closely shows that as personal consumption grows, we actually grow with it. Now having said that in some of the emerging markets where there might be personal consumption and macro headwinds, we can still grow, like India because we have very low per caps and we have significant investments in feet on the street, infrastructure, brands. We are just really building our business and India showed that again this year. So that's what I would say about your comment of the emerging market. The growth story there is far from over for a long time to come. And I guess, the rest were about U.S. pricing and decline in soft drinks. So maybe I should just pass that on to Steve.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. Thanks, Ahmet. First, I'd just underscore on the broader question what Muhtar said in his prepared remarks that in this quarter, we delivered the highest number of servings ever reported in the third quarter. So I think that bodes well for our growth story going forward. But with regards to North American pricing, which I heard you asked, Bill, and in particular sparkling price, we feel good about delivering positive price mix in the quarter of plus 1%, in line with our strategy to consistently earn at least one to two points of sparkling with consumers. And the U.S. Coke system remains committed to taking rational pricing and we\u2019ve done this very well over the past several years. In fact, we achieved two to three points of price mix in sparkling beverages and across our total portfolio in both 2011 and 2012. Year-to-date we are 2% sparkling price mix, which we feel good about. But I think it\u2019s important to remember we\u2019ve always said that we\u2019re going to focus on consumer-centric pricing. And if I can give you an example of that -- the average price today of an eight-ounce serving of Coca-Cola is $0.25, exactly $0.25. This is up over 5% versus two years ago and it\u2019s up nearly 10% versus three years ago, which compares very favorably to the U.S. inflation market. And this tells me really three things: First, at $0.25 we do not have an affordability issue. Coca-Cola remains a very affordable indulgence. Two, we've been able to earn price above inflation in the United States. And three, we still have plenty of room to continue to take price. But now addressing the third quarter in particular, we acknowledge we did strategically invest in select promotional activity in the back half of the summer through the Labor Day holiday. Given that we essentially didn't have much of a 4th of July holiday, a Memorial Day holiday, this Labor Day acted much more like a 4th of July holiday. But these investments were tied to specific occasion-based brands and packages to help drive incremental household penetration which they did, attract more consumers into the category, which happened and is very much in line with our longstanding North American strategy. And all of these activities that we did, all of them to take price in the marketplace, I think, set us up very well to take more price in this quarter and going into 2014. So we are very confident that the pricing environment in North America remains very rational and we will able to continue to earn price in the marketplace in this quarter and going forward into next year.\nMuhtar Kent: Yes, just let me round up that question with one final remark, Bill. And that is that once again, if you take our world average per capita of around 90, just under 90, you take the most populous nations of the world that are less than half of that per capita. India, China, Indonesia, way below that number, way below half of that number. We believe this and many other parts of the world as well in Africa, the youngest billion, we believe that -- we believe the critics whoever they are, are wrong. I don\u2019t understand that sentiment. We are growing while others are not at the moment and our business and balance portfolio is built for times like these. So we see this as a time of opportunity.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: Hi. Good morning.\nMuhtar Kent: Good morning Bryan.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: Question about Mexico in excise taxes, I guess it\u2019s been in the press over the last -- especially more so over last couple of week and then speaking the some of your bottling partners. In Mexico, specifically teams like they are sort of more resigned to the potential that\u2019s it\u2019s going to be a reality. So I guess if you can talk a little bit about just how you see the situation unfolding in Mexico? The extent that we get or you\u2019ll get an excise tax increase. How you plan to or do you plan to do anything differently in Mexico with response to it, may be some thoughts about elasticity and then finally just any concern that there is spillover into other market would also be helpful?\nMuhtar Kent: Yes. Look Bryan, firstly let me just address that by saying regressive taxes do not work. And wherever we have seen them being implemented, in some cases they have been taken away by the government after two, three years. Basically like in Denmark they are not working wherever else they\u2019ve been implemented and so the consumer suffers and then its proven time and time after again. We\u2019ve made our case to the government. We have tremendous respect for the government of -- President Pena Nieto. And we need to understand that -- and we have made our case that\u2019s really does not have anything to do with health policy. In order to address the health policy properly, we have to come and work together with government and with civil society to raise their awareness and to create program that will really work, that really drive physical activity. And therefore just a regressive discriminatory tax on one part of the food industry, just is not going to work and would currently that\u2019s all I would really like to say because its discussions are in progress. And I don\u2019t want to comment any further.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: Are there any preparations for, I guess, just trying to understand, if it does become a reality, is there -- do you have plans in place to deal with it if it does occur?\nMuhtar Kent: Well I just don\u2019t want to comment on it at this moment. As I said it\u2019s -- there is lot of discussions going on and that would be wrong for me to publicly comment on any of those discussions. And therefore we\u2019ll deal with whatever the result is in the most effective way. I can assure you that we will continue to prosper the business. We have -- we are one of the largest -- we are the largest consumer goods business in the country. We are largest contributors to the GDP in that country by a big margin. And we support millions of retailers in the country effectively for their livelihood and therefore I think that we will certainly find the right way forward whatever happens.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from John Faucher from JPMC. Your line is open.\nJohn Faucher - JPMC: Thank you very much. Muhtar and Gary, you guys talked about the price mix number improving sequentially which was good to see. So Gary I guess -- you talk a little bit about how you see this playing out over the next sort of 12 to 24 months where you have the negative geographic mix offset by the sort of the positive mix on a per case basis is the bottler territories where you own the bottler gets better like North America versus the absolute level of pricing? How should we look at those factors sort of competing against each other to try and map something out? And then one other housekeeping question, which was your comments on operating profits for the year, could you just revise those and restate those just because there is some confusion about whether it was currency neutral or non-currency neutral, what have you? Thanks.\nGary P. Fayard: Okay, John. Let me see how well I can do on this and then you can come back and ask. But first, going to price mix and just as a reprice in general on price mix, generally what we see and I am going to take this in steps. Generally what we see is you see pricing. So you see rate and mix -- positive rate and mix would be positive across almost all of the groups. You would then see negative -- generally you would see negative geographic mix and it's basically a function of higher growth in emerging market countries than developed market countries, which would give you a negative geographic mix. Then on top of that and you are absolutely right, then where we own bottlers and they are growing and that gives you then a positive price mix, because they are finished products versus concentrate. So a couple of things. So if you go back to the second quarter, I talked about margins and I thought margins would moderate and because of geographic mix, in the follow-up to a question, I remember, I said because we expect North America to actually perform better and that will actually hurt margins because it\u2019s a finished product business where margins are lower. But it helps price mix and what you are seeing today is what price mix in North America was even for the quarter. We are getting positive price mix from our finished product businesses going forward and not talking about specifically about 2014, because we're still in the midst of planning 2014, we'll give you full review on our views on next year in the February call. We are planning to take appropriate pricing that would -- and Steve referred to taking pricing in North America as well. So we are expecting to take pricing. So going forward what I would expect to see is that we should have a positive in rate going forward. We should have a positive in mix going forward. We should have a positive from finished products going forward. And we should have a negative from geographic mix. So, that's the kind of \u2013 and if you add all that up, it should be a positive price mix and that\u2019s what we would expect and it\u2019s what we would expect is within our long-term earnings growth model is positive price mix long term. Now let me see if I can turn to operating income. When I was talking about operating income, it was definitely currency-neutral; it was an ex-structural. So let's be very clear on both of those. Currency-neutral and ex-structural. So operating income was 8% currency-neutral, ex-structural for the quarter and 6% year-to-date currency-neutral, ex-structural. And what I said was we now expect the full year to be generally in line with the first half of the year. So somewhere in that ballpark and that is net of currency neutral and net of the structural impact, because I can tell you with the structural impact it would -- it's a point of negative structural impact and so that would take our year-to-date from six to five, for example. So, just to be clear ex-structural, currency-neutral.\nJohn Faucher - JPMC: So, and I am not trying to trick you into guidance or anything here. But it basically sounds like you are saying sort of currency neutral ex-structural mid-single-digit year-to-date. So therefore that implies to Q4 but then you talked about the currency impact. So as we are looking at those should basically offset to sort of get you to like slight operating profit growth for the quarter?\nMuhtar Kent: Well, without giving guidance what we are basically saying is that the full year we think ex-structural and ex-currency at all to be in line pretty much where we are year-to-date.\nOperator: Our next question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: I had one follow-up question on North America and then a question about Europe. So in North America, there has been a lot written about the declines that we've seen in diet sodas and see if I am not sure if you went through that and whether you shared some of the similar concerns that people have written about the decline in diets and sort of your perspective on whether the artificial sweetener issue is impacting the category at all and kind of from your strategy and dealing with that situation?\nMuhtar Kent: Yeah. Steve, do you want to address that?\nSteve Cahillane: Yeah. Thanks, Judy. First, I didn\u2019t talk specifically about Diet. I would underscore that we have a very wide portfolio in North America led by brand Coca-Cola, which is twice the size of Diet Coke of brand Coca-Cola as you know grew 2% in the quarter which we are pleased with. Diet Coke is like a lot of Diet products in the United States and not just beverages, but across the whole array of food are under a bit of pressure as people are questioning ingredients, ingredient safety and so forth. But we believe very strongly in the future of Diet Coke, the number two sparkling brand in the United States. We\u2019ve got terrific programs against it. We are actually seeing increased incidence in the past quarter between 19 and 24 year olds. We think a lot of that has to do with the exciting new promotions with Taylor Swift, some of the new packaging we are bringing in the marketplace and increased focus on Diet Coke. But there are headwinds. There are headwinds that we are facing and we face headwinds in a lot of different areas, in a lot of different places and this is just one of them. But last year it became the second best selling sparkling in the United States and we are continue to focus on it. Coke Zero also a part of our zero-calorie portfolio grew mid-single digits in the quarter. So we are very happy about that. We\u2019ve got a great program around Coke Zero. College GameDay just kicked off. It\u2019s really becoming ever more relevant with young males. So we are confident that throughout our whole portfolio we are offering consumers exactly what they want, when they want it, how they want it, at the right prices that they want it and we\u2019ll continue to focus on any of the headwinds around Diet Coke and we are confident that it has a bright future in this country.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then just on Europe, the improvements that we saw in Northwest Europe and Germany as well, I guess, to what do you attribute that to, perhaps weather getting much better in the quarter as opposed to the macros and consumers, and kind of what you guys are doing to really rejuvenate growth in those markets?\nMuhtar Kent: Well, Judy this is Muhtar. First, I think it\u2019s important to understand that and I\u2019ve said this in the past that the economies are performing at a different pace in the continents of Europe, not -- it\u2019s not everywhere is really bad, not everywhere it\u2019s really good. And so you still have very challenging consumer sentiments in Spain, in Italy, in Greece, in Portugal in the South, in Southeast Europe and what used to be termed as the Balkans, Romania, Bulgaria, former Yugoslavia. It\u2019s a very challenging environment. And then you\u2019ve got a better environment in Northwest Europe and then certainly the best environment still in Germany. And so based on those, our business also reflects some of those conditions and so it\u2019s a pretty good mirror actually. And I will ask Irial to comment on Germany and why we\u2019ve been consistently performing in Germany and growing our business. And again, the tremendous sequential improvement versus the first half in many countries of Northwest Europe, in Scandinavia and also Northwest European countries, Irial?\nIrial Finan: Thanks, Muhtar. And this actually goes back to one of the earlier questions. I think in Germany we\u2019ve got an economy that\u2019s doing okay. We have got actually really good marketing, married up with continued excellent execution and you bring all that together and you get great results. And for me in Germany it gives me great confidence about the future of our business, quite frankly, because we are seeing, where we\u2019ve put in the hard work, where we do the right things in the business. We do get good results and Germany is just an example of what can happen, quite frankly, in many markets around the world as the economies turn and improve.\nMuhtar Kent: Ahmet, do you want to comment on that?\nAhmet Bozer: Yeah. I just wanted to -- hi, Judy. I just wanted to say to the others, so we had a very, very strong Share a Coke campaign across Europe this summer that worked extremely well. We are ever more closely aligned with our bottling partners, really driving growth. And just on the macro, I\u2019d like to add that there is a clear divergence between north and south. So north continues to do better and south continues to do worse. So our business in the north certainly is reflective of that.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Hey. Can you just talk about the timing of some of the re-franchise in the U.S., because I think we talked a lot about it earlier in the year and it\u2019s kind of hit a low recently and then I\u2019ve a follow-up?\nMuhtar Kent: Yes, I think it\u2019s all target as we have said -- reported previously, or we\u2019ve made very sound and significant and good progress and discussions with some of our existing partners, as well as discussions ongoing with some other prospective partners. So we are on target, if not, a little bit ahead and I think you'll hear more about it in the coming sort of period ahead of this and I will ask Steve just to maybe shed some more light on it.\nSteve Cahillane: Bill, I mean the one thing I would really underscore is we absolutely have not hit a low. Don't take the absence of public commentary to mean that we are not making very good, very constructive progress. All of our bottling partners, both current and prospective, are extremely excited about this business in the United States about the opportunities to continue to be franchise partners in the United States, to grow the business in the United States. And we are making a very exciting progress and we will have more to report in the coming months.\nBill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: And then just on the SG&A costs, can you just give us a little bit more color on what drove some pretty significant efficiencies, that's obviously great? But was the advertising ratio flat or up and then maybe what drove some of the other improvements on that line item?\nMuhtar Kent: Are you talking about productivity, Bill?\nBill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Yes, productivity and SG&A broadly, yes.\nGary P. Fayard: Sure, Bill. Within the quarter, we continued to invest in marketing. So marketing is actually up in the quarter and up year-to-date. We had significant productivity savings in the quarter. We have some previously announced productivity programs that we announced back in 2012. Those 2012 programs will go through 2015 and really focus around productivity and then reinvesting those back into the business that we are focused on information systems, marketing, supply chain, innovation, operational excellence, that sort of thing. I can tell you -- we will give you a full update on it at the year-end call. So I can give you the full year but we are making very good progress against the goals. And you will see that on the February call when we go through a full update. And we\u2019ve got hard savings and soft savings. So let me give you some examples of what's happening and it\u2019s adding into the productivity and some of the leverage that you are seeing. So -- and things like supply chain, if the pricing [ph] is cheaper, hard savings. So we are doing a lot around supply chain and actually getting a lot of hard savings and those you are seeing are being reflected.  In marketing, if you can buy media cheaper, then we just buy more media. Basically it\u2019s what we are doing. So we are reinvesting back into marketing and be enable to buy more media for the same price, if you will. So we -- as I say we will give you a full update on all of the productivity programs in February at our year-end call. But we're making excellent progress and you're seeing a lot of that, it\u2019s what's coming through the G&A line, as I say within that marketing, SG&A marketing being up for the quarter and year-to-date.\nBill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Was there any benefit from the incentive compensation accruals, either this quarter or maybe end of the fourth quarter as well? \nGary P. Fayard: Very, very little. There is a huge cycling of last year in the first quarter as I've mentioned earlier. But there is very little -- I mean there is a little bit but nothing of significance in the quarter of this year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Your line is open.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein: Just one quick thing and then a real question. So, I just want to underscore something again, because it's a key conspiracy and I think what Steve said a moment ago is music to a lot of investors\u2019 ears and I want to replay to make sure I understand. So did you say that the past couple of months in North America from a price, from an investment perspective were little bit more of a blip in that we should expect something like higher pricing that we saw in 2011 and 2012 going forward in North America?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, thanks Ali. I think that's a fair interpretation of what I said. This was a very different summer. It's been a difficult year starting with the fiscal cliff and sequestration and payroll taxes and so forth and then the summer was very sluggish. And it\u2019s very important in our business to keep consumers engaged with our brands to make sure that we are in the households, to make sure that teens are being recruited. And so Labor Day acted very much like 4th July or a Memorial Day, whereas typically it would not. It would be the end of summer. And Labor Day acted more like the only summer. So it was more promotional than you would have seen. It would be more promotional than what we would expect going forward. But those things happened from time to time. And we think that the pricing environment will continue to be very strong, very rational and because of all the investments we\u2019re making in our brands, we feel that we have the opportunity to earn even more price going forward in the marketplace. And that would be absolutely our intention to do that.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein: Okay. That makes perfect sense.\nAhmet Bozer: I just want to add one thing. In terms of the Nielsen\u2019s data, yes that\u2019s exactly the reflection but don\u2019t underestimate. We took very healthy pricing in [ice tea], also in the quarter. And so overall, that\u2019s how you get to the one price mix positive on sparkling. And so don\u2019t let that point go unnoticed at the moment.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein: I appreciate that. That makes a lot of sense. And then a broader question, I don\u2019t know how often you revisit this but what do you think the company has to grow volumes between now and 2020 to deliver on the 2020 vision, given some of the recent slowdown in volumes. And I guess in that context, do you think as a company you have to acquire more to reach that vision?\nMuhtar Kent: I would say that first we believe that our long-term growth model with appropriate mix which we believe we can take and we can generate. It would definitely get us to our 2020 vision of -- from our system revenue point of view of doubling our business with the base of 2010. So that is sort of trajectory if you like and we\u2019re on track in terms of moving ahead to doing -- achieving our goal. The second piece is -- we always -- we\u2019ll always be looking for any kind of bolt-on acquisitions as may make sense but that\u2019s the expense of what I would say that right now we would be looking at. Bolt-on acquisitions and that\u2019s sort of if there is an opportunity, we will look at it seriously.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein: And in some the difference of volume versus price mix to reach the system doubling goal, has that shift -- has it shifted at all between the two?\nMuhtar Kent: Sorry. Sorry. Say that again.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein: Well, so to double the system sales by 2020, there is perhaps an ingoing assumption of what would be from volume and what would be from price mix. Has the recent global slowdown shifted that mix at all between volume growth and price mix growth to reach the doubling of sales?\nGary P. Fayard: I don\u2019t think materially. If you look at our long-term growth that sort of corridor of volume plus what we\u2019ve been achieving, I think the balance is still there.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein: Okay.\nGary P. Fayard: Same as it used to be.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Wendy Nicholson from Citi Research. Your line is open.\nWendy Nicholson - Citi Research: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. First question on China, can you talk about the acceleration, the pick-up in volumes there whether that was driven by any change in pricing or promotional levels and what your outlook kind of a normalized run rate because that region has been so lumpy in terms of volume growth kind of as we go into \u201814 whereas the base case of volume growth? And then my second question is looking at the buyback program, the stock is on track for two years of relative underperformance. And we haven\u2019t seen that for a while and yet your targets for buyback hasn\u2019t changed since the beginning of the year. So I\u2019m kind of surprised the balance sheet you have with the weakness in the stock, and certainly Muhtar with your resounding confidence about the launch of outlook. You\u2019re not getting more aggressive on the buyback here? Thanks.\nMuhtar Kent: Yeah. I\u2019ll have Ahmet just comment on China then maybe Gary can finish off the second part of the question. Sure.\nAhmet Bozer: Thanks Wendy. You might remember that in our last call, we talked about the fact that we were evolving both our organization and our strategy in China. And what we see in the third quarter really encourages us that we had not only 9% growth in total but also 8% growth in sparkling. And that\u2019s pretty much delivers on the expectation that we\u2019ve said that we would expect sequential improvement from the first half results in the second half of this year and we expect that sequential improvement from the first half results to continue into 2014. To your question on pricing promotion, we did not have any significant marked pricing promotions in the marketplace. It was basically a combination of a), beginning to implement parts of our new strategy in the marketplace; b) the same share of co-promotion that we are scaling up these wonderful global assets in all parts of the world. And then our new team beginning to gel together connecting with our bottling system and really improving execution. So we are encouraged by those results and we expect to continue to, as I said, improve sequentially from the first half results.\nGary P. Fayard: Yes, Wendy, relative to share repurchase let me just first \u2013 let me just start with the preface that don't particularly agree with you on saying our share repurchase has relatively underperformed for the last two years. But after that, couple of thoughts on share repurchase. Our view on share repurchase is that share repurchase is value neutral. It is not something that grows value. It does for the short-term holder, so maybe you can get a buck in the share price but for the long-term holder it is not something that's value enhancing. It is much more like a cash sufficient dividend, which is the way we treat it. And that our priorities for cash are number one to reinvest in the business, to grow the business that will include bolt-on acquisitions et cetera. Number two would be dividends, which we have increased for the last 51 years, 10% this year and third, excess cash would be put into share repurchase. And just because we don't need the cash in the business, so it's a return of cash to shareholders. But leveraging the balance sheet to do something that we would view as value neutral, we don't think, is the right thing to do. So we continue to just perform exactly in line with the target that we set at the beginning of the year.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Gary, Ahmet, Steve, Irial and Jackson. We delivered sound third quarter results within an ongoing challenged macroeconomic environment. While we saw sequentially improvement in the business, we remain constructively discontent and resolutely focused on further advancing our growth trajectory. Our 2020 vision and long-term strategies remain firmly intact. And together with our global bottling partners we are investing in our brands and our capabilities to further strengthen our system and to drive sustainable growth and value. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

These schedules reconciles certain non-GAAP financial measures which should be made referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Please look on our website for this information. Now, let me turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter volume performance came in below our expectations. There was a confluence of factors that negatively lead to unusually weak second quarter volume results. We continue to see further [unrest] in Europe slowing economic conditions across markets like Asia and Latin and social unrest in South East Europe, Middle East and Brazil. On top of this we were faced with unusually widespread wet and cold weather conditions across the multiple regions, including North America and across Northern Europe and India all of which impacted the entire industry. Consequently we grew global volume 1% in the second quarter leading to year to date volume growth of 3%. Our comparable currency neutral operating income excluding structural grew 5% year to date. And both in the quarter and year to date we gained global volume and value share in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages as well as in both sparkling and still beverages. These gains included volume and value share increases in corresponding juice, tea and water all of which underscored the real strength of our brands and the global reach of our system. While we are not happy with our second quarter volume performance, I can ensure you that we are intensely focused on improving those areas we can control to ensure better performance in the second half of the year. Looking forward, we remain absolutely confident in our 2020 vision and in our system\u2019s ability to execute to grow and to create value all across the world. As we\u2019ve also said during these challenging global economic times there will occasionally be a bump in the road and the real strength of a business is how you deal with that bump. In that respect together with our system bottling partners we continue to invest in our brand to strengthen our system for the future and to achieve our long term growth target. The fact that we\u2019ve outperformed the industry in this most recent quarter reinforces our belief that we are navigating these circumstances in a way that further strengthens our position of leadership within this extremely vibrant and resilient beverage industry. Let me now provide you with an overview of our business performance by operating group starting with North America. In North America, volume declined 1% in the quarter as a 4% decline in sparkling beverages offset 5% volume growth in our still beverage portfolio. Year-to-date volume in North America was even. Prior to this quarter we consistently grew our business in North America for 12 consecutive quarters. Unfortunately, we experienced an extremely wet and cold second quarter with more rain in the US in June than we\u2019ve seen in 50 years and 44% more precipitation than in June of last year. This weather clearly impacted our entire industry\u2019s volume growth. Nevertheless we gained sparkling volume and value share both in the quarter and year to date reflecting the strength of our brand, and we have robust marketing plans in place for the balance of 2013. Still beverages gained volume and value share in the quarter making this the 24th consecutive quarter that our still beverage portfolio has either maintained or gained value share. Our growth in still beverages this quarter was led by strong performance across the ready to drink tea and packaged water categories with brands such as Gold Peak, smartwater and Dasani leading the way. Further, our volume and value share gains in the juices and juice drinks category were driven by solid growth for Simply and Minute Maid. We are confident that we are on the right track in North America and we continue to work diligently with our bottlers as we advance our refranchising plan. Indeed, we saw a sequential improvement across the quarter in both the convenience retailer and quick service restaurant channel suggesting that the category trends are beginning to improve. While we do recognize that we still have work to do in North America, we remain laser focused on the strategy that we have shared with you. First, we are building a balanced portfolio of strong brands led by Coca-Cola and ensuring that our portfolio remains relevant to all generations of consumers and across all beverage occasions. Second, we are focused on translating this brand value into unsurpassed customer value by delivering best in class customer service each and every single day. And third, we\u2019re continuously investing to build the capabilities we will need to sustain and to repeat our success. These strategies are taking a real hold and we are building on them with the evolution of the United States franchise system announced earlier this year. We therefore believe we are well positioned to continue outperforming the non-alcoholic ready to drink beverage industry for the balance of the year. Turning now to Latin America, we grew volume 2% in the quarter and 3% year to date. Volume growth was a little softer in the quarter due to macroeconomic challenges in the few major markets, specifically increase in consumer debt levels and higher food inflations along with concern over transportation fees contributed to some civil unrest and softer consumer spending in Brazil. In Mexico, weaker job creation and higher inflation impacted disposable income resulting in reduced retail sales. These macro factors led to low single digit volume growth in Mexico while volume results in Brazil were even. Given slower growth rate in personal consumption across the region, we estimate that year-to-date beverage industry growth rates are currently 1.5 to 2 percentage points lower than the average of the last four years in Latin America. In the second quarter, we again gained volume share in Latin America in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages including both volume share gains in both sparkling and still beverages. Moving to brand performance, trademark Coca-Cola grew 1% during the quarter and maintained volume share within the sparkling beverages category. These results reflect sustained marketing across the brand and the category. Our other sparkling brands grew volume and value share in the quarter as we expanded Mundet in Mexico and Fanta in Colombia while reigniting marketing behind Schweppes in both Brazil and Argentina. High single digit growth in still beverages led to volume share gains in the quarter. These results were driven by the expansion of Fuze Tea, continued strong performance of Del Valle portfolio and strong share gains in POWERADE, thanks to superior execution of our programs. We expect that our Latin America group will return to rates of volume growth that we have been more accustomed to in the last few years given current dynamics. Continued marketing and bottling investments along with solid execution plans for the second half of the year will also contribute to this improvement. I will bring my America\u2019s update to close by congratulating the associates of Solar, our new bottling partner in Brazil. With the close of this transaction, Solar forms the second largest operation in the Coca-Cola Brazil system serving over 70 million consumers. Now, turning to Coca-Cola International starting with Europe. The weak economy continues to be a key factor affecting our performance in Europe especially in the southern regions where unemployment remains high while consumer confidence and expenditures remain low. We\u2019re seeing this continue to play out across most fast moving consumer goods category with several of those slowing between the first and second quarter. Additionally, historically wet and cold conditions across Europe including the coldest spring for Germany in 40 years further dampens already weak consumer sentiment and industry trends and contributed to volume declining 3% in Germany in the quarter. While our European volume fell 4% in the quarter and then down 2% year-to-date, we maintained the positive share momentum of the first quarter growing volume and value share across total nonalcoholic beverages and core sparkling beverages. Across the continent, our team and bottling partners are activating a number of marketing and trade execution program. Among them is our new Share a Coke, summer campaign launched across Europe in May and early signs are very positive. In fact, excitement surrounding the launch helps to partially offset the impact to weather on immediate consumption. Our current European outlook remains cautious for the time being given ongoing macroeconomic conditions. However, we believe with our commitment to our brands and execution, we should continue to gain share through the remainder of the year. Moving on to our Eurasia and Africa group, we achieved 9% volume growth in the quarter, up double digits year-to-date. All business units grew in the quarter with our Middle East and North Africa business unit as well as our Central, East and West Africa business unit delivering double-digit growth. For the quarter, we strengthened our competitive position as we gain volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Local execution of our global marketing campaign along with continued highest pack innovation feels as good which was led by brand Coca-Cola up 7% in the quarter and 9% year-to-date. Fanta and Sprite further contributed to core sparkling growth while our still brands grew double digits led by Rani, Crystal and Fuze Tea. Volume in Russia grew 3% with trademark Coca-Cola up double digits. The successful sparkling promotion fueled Coca-Cola Fanta and Sprite growth as consumers collected under the cap points to obtain a limited edition set of limited Winter Olympic glassware. In Spain and Portugal we are encouraged by the early integration efforts underway at efforts underway at Coca-Cola Iberian partners of Spain and Portugal. We now have eight bottlers in those markets now operating as a single entity. Shifting to our Pacific group, we saw a volume growth of 2% and we maintained on our alcoholic ready to drink value share. As is well publicized, China\u2019s economy has been slowed as this is now being soft consumer spending. China\u2019s first half retail sales was the slowest in 10 years while much of the growth in the non-alcoholic ready to drink beverage industry in the second quarter came from the value oriented water category. As a result, our volume performance in China remains softened with even for the quarter cycling 7% growth from prior year. We command a leadership position in China in those (inaudible) and market share in sparkling as well as in juices and juice drink. Sparkling volume grew 2% and our juices and juice drinks volume grew 7% year to date. This is driven by a solid execution of key consumer and commercial initiatives and continue our new product innovation. Looking forward, we are keenly focused on adjusting our strategies and improving our business in China. We recently strengthened our management team in that region adding to the already strong talents that we have in China and we are evolving our strategy, reallocating resources across our brand portfolio and strengthening our consumer communication. We anticipate a return to growth in our China business in the second half of the year. In India, volume grew low single digits in the quarter cycling 20% growth last year and importantly we again improved our volume and value share of total non-alcoholic beverages as well as sparkling and still beverages further strengthening our competitive position as trademark Coca-Cola grew by double digit. Our business in Japan delivered 1% volume growth while approximately 4% growth last year and we are seeing sequential improvements on share trends as we are moving through the year. Japan sparkling beverage volume grew 1% in the quarter supported by music team integrated marketing campaign such as the Zero Limit Campaign for Coca-Cola Zero up 13%. Solid growth in tea and sport drinks of 3% and 7% respectively also contributed to this momentum. Our juice and coffee performance was below our expectation and we are keenly focused on strategies as new launches to improve performance in the second half of the year. I do want to acknowledge and congratulate our Coca-Cola East Japan associates on the successful completion of their merger and the launch of their company on July 1. With this merger our system is building on a deep root and 50 year history of strong partnerships in Japan. Coca-Cola East Japan will be well positioned to meet the business growth needs of our customers while also engaging and refreshing consumers of all ages and lifestyle. Lastly our Asia\u2019s business unit delivered results with 10% volume growth cycling double digit growth from the previous year as Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam all delivered strong double digit growth. Going forward we expect to see an improvements in our Pacific group\u2019s performance in the second half of the year. On a global scale, we were recently humbled by several accolades, including rising to number five on Behrens list both world\u2019s most respected companies and receiving the 2013 Creative Marketer of the Year Award at the Cannes Lions International Festival. In my 35 years of experience in the Coca-Cola system, I\u2019ve learnt that we -- how we participate in one of the fastest growing and most dynamic industries in the world. As I think about the second quarter, nothing has changed in our ability to continue winning in this industry. There is no question. There are systems commitment to superior execution with stronger than ever before and our business fundamentals remain firmly intact. Our leadership team is firmly in place and I am confident in our ability to capitalize on the abundant opportunities that lie ahead. Given this we\u2019re confident that we have the right strategy, we have the right vision and the right initiatives to drive long-term sustainable growth and value. And our focus on achieving our 2020 Vision is unwavering with current dynamics leading us to believe that our performance will be better in the back half of the year. Why? Quite simply a few important reasons. First, our global brands are stronger than ever and we will continue to invest in them to capture long-term volume and value share. Second, we have an unparallel global business system focused on delivering on our 2020 Vision. And third, we have great confidence in our plans and we will sharpen our focus to ensure our resources are directed to those strategic priorities that will drive our business and strengthen key markets will return to grow. The nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry is and has always -- and always will be a terrific, terrific business. We will continue to capitalize on our unprecedented global reach, a broad portfolio of preferred premium brands and superior system execution. And we continue to invest alongside our global bottling partners. And we are well positioned to effectively manage our business for long-term profitable growth both in today\u2019s economic environments and also as we look forward to our future. With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary.\nGary Fayard: Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. As Muhtar has shared, the industry clearly slowed a little due a number of factors that impacted various markets around the world. The combination of these factors resulted in weaker volume performance in the second quarter than we expected. At the same time we recognize the need for improved performance in certain markets. Having said that, we remain absolutely focused on doing the right things for the long-term health of the business and investing for long-term sustainable growth. Increasing share during times like this further strengthens our position and can ultimately lead to accelerated growth as market conditions normalize. And we continue to win on this front gaining both global volume and value share in both total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as volume and value share in global sparkling and still beverages. So, let\u2019s review our results in more detail, starting with the review of the key drivers of our financial performance. Our second quarter and year-to-date financial performance reflects concentrate sales growth in line with unit case, volume growth, as well as a strong increase in direct marketing expenses, as we sustain our commitment to invest in the health and the strength of our brands. From an operating segment standpoint, our operating income growth this quarter reflected strong profit growth in Latin America and Eurasia, and Africa, as well as the continued solid financial performance of the Bottling Investments Group. Operating income in North America and Pacific was even while Europe experienced a slight decline in profit. Comparable currency neutral net revenue declined 1% this quarter and we were even year-to-date. However, excluding the impact of structural items, primarily the sale of the Philippines bottler, net revenues increased 2% both for the quarter and year-to-date. We continue to earn pricing in the marketplace, but at a consolidated level the positive pricing was offset by the impact of geographic mix, resulting in even price mix for both the quarter and year-to-date. Although geographic mix unfavorably impacted price mix at the consolidated level, it contributed to the improvement of our gross margin in the quarter and year-to-date. Our comparable gross margin was 61.2%. This represents a slight improvement compared to the prior year primarily due to the impact of geographic mix, structural items and our foreign currency hedging program. As we shared in our first-quarter earnings call we expect our gross margin to moderate somewhat over the remainder of this year, primarily due to a shift in geographic mix. Excluding the impact of structural items, we achieved 2 points of favorable operating expense leverage for both the quarter and year-to-date and we now expect to achieve low single-digit operating expense leverage for the full year. On comparable currency neutral operating income, it was up 4% this quarter and year-to-date. Excluding the impact of structural items, operating income grew 5% year to date. On a comparable basis, the impact of currency was a 3% headwind on this quarter\u2019s operating income results. And based on our hedge positions, current spot rate and the cycling of our prior year rates, we expect currencies to be a 4% headwind on our operating income for the third quarter and full year. Below the line, we benefited from an increase in net interest income and improved tax rate and fewer shares outstanding due to our continued share repurchase program. We expect net interest income in the second half of the year to be relatively in line with comparable net interest income year-to-date. Additionally, we now expect our full year tax rate to be 23% and we expect to hold this rate through 2014. Comparable earnings-per-share grew 4% in the second quarter despite currency headwinds of approximately 2%. Year-to-date comparable earnings-per-share also grew 4% despite currency headwinds of approximately 4% as well as the impact of two fewer selling days. We continue to generate a strong 4 billion from cash from operations year-to-date providing a significant financial flexibility. As I have shared with you over the years we redeploy our cash flows utilizing a consistent and disciplined framework. First is to reinvest back into the business and to strengthen our global system. Secondly to continue to expand our portfolio and capabilities through bolt-on acquisitions and partnerships. Third, continue to return cash to shareholders through our dividends and we increased our dividend 10% in 2013, our 51st consecutive year of dividend increases. And lastly, repurchase shares, year-to-date our net share repurchases totaled $2 billion and we continue to expect full year share repurchase to be between 3 billion and 3.5 billion. As you model our 2013 operating results, let me again remind you that the steps we\u2019ve taken along with our bottling partners to strengthen our global system will have a structural impact on our operating results over the remainder of the year. As you are aware, we closed the transaction in the Philippines earlier this year and the merger of our bottling partners in Brazil and Japan recently closed. As I have shared in our 2012 year-end call, we do not expect these transactions to have a material impact on our 2013 earnings results. However these transactions will impact various line items within our P&L. We anticipate that these transactions will have a 3% structural impact on our full year 2013 net revenues. Likewise our full year operating income results should see a 1% structural impact. However there should be a corresponding improvement in our equity income to account for our share of the results of these operations moving forward. Additionally, the structural impact from these transactions will be larger in the second half due to the impact of the deconsolidation of our Brazilian bottling operations beginning in the third quarter. In closing, we delivered solid financial performance for the first two quarters of 2013, and we expect to continue our solid financial performance during the second half of this year. Our company and our system are well-positioned to capitalize on the real opportunities for growth. We remain very confident as we continue to win in the marketplace with volume and value share. We continue to deliver solid financial results. We continue to innovate and invest in our brands. Our global system continues to get stronger. And we are best positioned to continue factoring growth in the dynamic nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry. Operator, we are now ready for any questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) And our first question today is from Bill Pecoriello from Consumer Edge Research.\nBill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research: Good morning, everybody. Muhtar, I was hoping if you could step around the world and dive a little bit deeper in the certain markets and regions to help us separate out the impact of non-recurring factors that hit your second quarter versus any macro-related factors that can continue to pressure the business in the second half. You had mentioned macro factors in Brazil, Mexico, Europe and China. Will those continue to be as big an impact in the second half of the second quarter and if not, why and then maybe you can help quantify maybe what you think the weather-related impact was in the second quarter?\nMuhtar Kent: Hi Bill. Thanks. I think overall both from in Europe, United States, India and some other parts we did have a pretty significant impact from weather, unusual weather, monsoons coming very early in India, as you probably all read, many thousands missing in flooding, worst flooding since the Tsunami back 10 years ago. And in Europe also, Central Europe, Germany, all the issues around the river beds rising and flooding and very heavy wet conditions. So we did, yeah, have impact both from a consumer sentiment, both from a mobility sentiment in the United States also, and both also from just pure in some cases distribution issues that hindered our performance. And as you know, when we lose a sale that does not recur any more we lost it that day. And so and also in some cases, we were cycling very unusually warm and favorable weather conditions from prior years in some cases. Like India last year, the monsoons actually started later that gave us a 20% growth in India unusual for the second quarter in India, usually the first half in India is always less than the second half in India because of the anomalies of the weather. So, yeah and then macro conditions, we all have felt it in social issues in Southeast Europe, the demonstrations across the Middle East and then more recently in Brazil. But we feel confident both in terms of looking at our plans in place, looking at current dynamics at both Brazil will have a better second half. China will have a better second half, Russia will have a better second half and certainly better quarters than this last quarter where we grew volume 3% overall, Mexico as well as India. So while we continue to invest in our brands, our brands are stronger than ever before. We have taken market share, our system is stronger. Hence all these key markets we believe will perform better in the second half. In fact, as I said, we have seen this -- we always know that the second half in a country like India is significantly better than the first half. In any case, if you look back at our performance over last few years. So, and then in the United States, I think we\u2019ve got very robust plans to return back to growth. So I -- we feel pretty confident that this was a confluence of events that happened all at the same time, the portfolio effect of our global business did not work in our favor in this particular case in the second quarter. And I feel -- and my colleagues feel and our bottlers feel very confident. I have been across many markets recently. I have traveled to China, Japan, Thailand, Myanmar, many other parts of Asia. I have been in the Southeast Europe. I have been in France and all in the last sort of four-five weeks. And I feel that we will look towards definitely a better quarter volumetrically. And again, we can talk to you about how we feel about the financial numbers too later in the call. And I can ask Gary to reflect on that too in terms of the second half. You want to -- Gary?\nGary Fayard: Sure. Well, let me continue on then, versus the volume. On the second half, on the P&L, I think we had a very solid first half. We would expect to have a solid second half of the year as well. We have said there\u2019d bumps along the road, the industry had one and obviously it slowed but we continue to take share and we feel very confident about the second half. As we look at the second half financial results I think we will be very close to our long-term growth targets, particularly in volume and earnings per share should be coming back in line with what we would all have been expecting at the first of this year.\nMuhtar Kent: I\u2019d just add, Bill, that I think this is more an anomaly. We should not see this as a trend or a systemic issue and that is simply how I believe one should think about it. And again, I can ask Steve and Ahmet to reflect upon how they see the second half from their vantage point in both Americas and international maybe Steve, you can start.\nSteve Cahillane : Sure, thanks Muhtar. Starting with Latin America, Muhtar said it well, we saw things in Brazil that we hadn\u2019t seen before, the economy slowed, there were social unrest. It didn\u2019t last very long, things are slowly getting back to normal and we expect a better performance sequentially as we progress through the year in Brazil and in Mexico. In Latin center and south Latin we\u2019ve seen very good results, high single digit result continues. So there is a lot still going very well that continue to go well in Latin America and Brazil and Mexico getting back to what we would expect to see on a normal basis. In North America, Muhtar said it, we don't like to talk about the weather but the first half of last year saw unusually good weather conditions. We had a warm weather, we had dry weather coming out of winter and going into spring. This year in North America we had some of the worst weather and you\u2019ve all seen it, it\u2019s been very wet, it's been very cold, it\u2019s been historically wet and cold which obviously impacts our business. On top of that, we had the payroll tax effects which started at the beginning of the year which affects lower income households obviously much more, affects their disposable income, their ability to spend, we saw late payroll tax -- late payroll or tax refund coming into the marketplace. But as we look forward we expect the weather patterns to obviously normalize. The weather will not continue to be a factor in a country as big as the United States like it\u2019s been and from an economic standpoint, people are used to the payroll tax now. They\u2019ve had four to five months to moderate their household budget to get used to it. The refunds, obviously is back in the marketplace and we\u2019re already starting to see better trends in QSR, better trends in convenience retail, better trends across our business. So we look forward to the second half of the year across the Americas much more favorably than the first half, Muhtar used the word anomaly, I think especially an anomaly in North America and we see ourselves coming out of that.\nAhmet Bozer: Thanks, Steve, thanks Muhtar. Yeah just to build further on Muhtar\u2019s comments, I will start with India, that\u2019s definitely completely weather-related. All our investments in the route to market, coolers and capabilities will continue to deliver the kind of levels that we\u2019re used to having from India in the rest of the year. So we\u2019re quite comfortable on that. On China, there were probably impacts of -- as you hear the continuing slowdown in macro levels as well as there were some weather impacts. But we do expect volume to return for a number of reasons. First of all, China is a country with very, very low per capitas. I have been there a number of times in the last three, four months and we have been working on evolving our strategy with better OBPPC, more price points and more packs as well as improving our capability. As Muhtar mentioned, we have recently strengthened our management team there and I am very confident that in the second half of the year we\u2019re going to start returning to growth in China, maybe not at the levels of double-digit that you might have been seeing but we\u2019ll certainly be looking to returning to growth in China. Now the other anomaly in the international results was Europe. I can comfortably say that a very, very big part of that 4% decline was driven by unseasonable weather as it has already been mentioned. It shows the strength of our system that we were able to gain volume and value share in both sparkling and NARTD and as we see whether normalizing, we again look forward to coming back to our normal range of growth in Europe. The rest of international territories such as EAG continue to deliver the historical growth rate.\nGary Fayard: And Bill, this is Gary. Just add one or two other quick data points as well. When we talk about 1% volume, I think you have to wonder, is that a weak one or a strong one. Let me just assure you it\u2019s as strong as it can be and still be 1%. So that\u2019s number one. The other thing is we talk about some of these anomalies in some of these markets. One other things that give me some confidence as well, because there has been a lot of discussion about what\u2019s happening with the emerging markets and all around the world with the slowdown from China, et cetera. But we\u2019ve always talked about the markets where the per capita consumption is less than $150 has always been a real strength of ours. Well, again, even in the second quarter, if you look at those markets under $150 and exclude China and India, which we\u2019ve just discussed separately, if you excluded those, our volume in those markets was plus 7% in the second quarter, so it still shows underlying strength of the market in those emerging markets.\nBill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research: Great. Thanks for the comprehensive answers.\nGary Fayard: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from John Faucher from JPMorgan.\nJohn Faucher - JPMorgan: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Gary, I just want to ask a clarification about the back half of the year. Your commentary on the financials, it sounds like you are saying, you are going to get to that level in the back half of the year not the back half of the year will get you to the long-term algorithm for the full year. At least that\u2019s how I interpreted it, can you just sort of clarify that?\nGary Fayard: Yeah, John. Thanks for the question. Here is how we\u2019d say, we are actually very close in the first half of the year. Year-to-date, if you look at operating income, I think, year-to-date, ex-structural currency neutral is plus 5% and our volume is plus 3%. So we are not that far away. So our view would be that we should be and that in fact, year-to-date earnings per share ex-currency is 8%, rounds up to 8%. So we\u2019re not that far away in the first half. That\u2019s why I was saying solid results and when I say solid, I think you followed us long enough. We like to be at the top end of ranges and not at the bottom end of ranges. Unfortunately, we are at bottom end right now, but that\u2019s the world we are dealing with. But we feel very good about the second half.\nJohn Faucher - JPMorgan: Okay.\nMuhtar Kent: John, this is Muhtar. Just one point that I can add to that is the following. It\u2019s customary sometimes that when in the kind of businesses that we are in, when you have a blip in your volume because of a confluence of events some of which are -- was not in your control. The first thing you do is go out and cut marketing, and I think if you look at our numbers, we have continued to invest aggressively in our brand through the second quarter, through the first -- in the first half and as you know every investment and marketing does not pay back in that quarter, it pays back in future quarters. And therefore we are confident there was a share gain. We are confident with the strength of our brands, we are confident about the metrics on our brands, both sparkling and stills across the world. We are confident in our bottling partners\u2019 investment plan that are taking place in the second quarter that we can continue our momentum going into the second half of the year and also improve on it volumetrically, but also continue with our mission to achieve our 2020 Vision through the next years ahead.\nJohn Faucher - JPMorgan: Got it. Okay. Thanks. Then my actual question here was, Gary, you\u2019ve got positive price mix in the vast, I think in every region this quarter, with the exception of specific I think in, yet it\u2019s not sort of going up to full positive price mix here. How do we view the regional price mix versus the geographic offset and how does this fit into your long-term algorithm, because it\u2019s seems like this is something that\u2019s most likely going to continue to be a notable overhang? Thanks.\nGary Fayard: Okay. John, first, I want to compliment on your creativity with that first question and here is a real question, anyway. It\u2019s great question actually. And the first thing I would say around pricing is, we believe strongly that we have premium brands and our brand should commend a premium in the market and they do commend a premium across the world. Number one, we're seeing pricing is rational and within the industry we think pricing is rational particularly in the United States. But if you look at price mix and I am going to go year to date, but the second quarter is essentially the same thing. If you look at price mix, price mix year-to-date is even but within that, you've got positive pricing and you\u2019ve got negative geographic mix. So year to date consolidated we actually have positive 1% pricing. If you look at it by region, year-to-date North America has positive pricing up 1%. Eurasia and Africa have positive piping up 8%, Europe has -- looks like positive pricing up 2% although I will tell you a lot of that is because of Innocent and our acquisition of the Innocent, so absent Innocent, Europe is closer to flat. Latin America is positive 8 points of pricing year to date. Pacific is even and Bottling Investments group is plus 2 as well. So we\u2019re actually getting very nice positive pricing as well as category mix, brand mix, channel mix. All of those things are working. What\u2019s happening to us and where the dent comes in, if you will, is that we got negative geographic mix. So we\u2019ve got significant negative geographic mix across many of those regions which brings us back to even when you put price and geography together overall at the consolidated level. As I have often said, geographic mix would -- is always going to be probably negative because you're going to expect those emerging market countries to be growing faster than the developed market countries and you got better pricing in the developed market countries. What amplified a little bit this quarter particularly perfectly was the result in Europe that we talked about and North America being coming at even where they were. So you put all that together, we\u2019re actually getting the kind of pricing, we would expect to be getting in the market.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: I just wanted to go back to the second half expectations and clearly you can\u2019t control the macros and the weather. But I just like to hear a little bit more specifically on some of the actions that you're doing to improve the volume performance, particularly markets like China where there is the macro issue but there is also competitive issue, there\u2019s also portfolio issues just in terms of not participating in some of the fast growth segments. So can you just talk about how you\u2019re thinking about marketing investments, how you\u2019re thinking about your portfolio? Can you accelerate price pack architecture strategy more aggressively to really get the volume performance even if the macros don\u2019t come back and the weather continues to be challenging?\nMuhtar Kent: Judy, let me just take on that and I will ask Ahmet Bozer to comment. But I think what we have said again is that it was a coming together of many events that usually don\u2019t come together all the time. I mean -- we have performed overall globally at rates that are much more commensurate to what you have been used to in the last three, four years. Despite the fact that we\u2019ve had issues, some of these issues happening to us from quarter to quarter. But you haven\u2019t felt them because -- because of the fact that the portfolio works. In this time, you have the issues in Latin America, in the two key markets Brazil and Mexico on slowing down and also consumer spending being impacted because of the Brazilian crunch in consumer credit that was taken away from the consumers. And generally the consumer spending went away and then you also had China -- the issues in China that was -- consumer spending is actually much below GDP levels and that\u2019s documented across the macro numbers in China as well as the weather issues related to India and also other issues coming together in North America where it went for the first time in 12 quarters from a plus to a negative, which we don't expect. All of these things we don't expect to continue at the same time. Some of these things may still continue to impact them. Therefore the portfolio will work. Now related -- specific to the China. We are participating in two great categories in China and where the leaders which is sparkling and juices, those categories we\u2019ve grown in. And they are adding tremendous value to our portfolio and to our business in China. We have also as we said retargeting all our efforts in China, refocusing all our efforts. Yeah, there is a different competitive landscape. We feel that actually that has not been the issue for us. The main issue for us is to ensure that we can continue to distribute in outlying areas in China that we have had some issues and we\u2019re correcting those and also that our marketing and working which we feel definitely our brands are stronger. Our innovation pipeline is working in terms of what we are providing to the consumer, also in terms of packaging. And we feel that our confidence that those two categories -- playing in those two categories and then also innovating across some other categories like dairy is going to create the growth and the value for us starting in the second quarter but also continuing. And we also feel confident that the Chinese leadership, the new Chinese leadership are going to ensure that they take the right actions and we\u2019re seeing that to reposition and transform the economy without creating a major bump as they transform the economy from a purely export economy to a more balanced economy with also consumer spending. And both deputy prime -- Vice Premier Yang in charge of the economy as well as the new team, we feel confident have the plans in place to ensure that that takes place. So again, Ahmet, you can reflect more on that as well as any other markets you want to.\nAhmet Bozer: Yeah. Thanks Muhtar. Thanks Judy for the question. A couple of messages here Judy, message number one is that economy may be down but the globe prospects in China even in the short term is there simply because of the very low level of capitals and strength of our system. Plan number two, if you look at all the competitors in China, nobody really participate in all the categories. All the players have one or two categories that they are strong in. And then they drive their businesses through those categories and maybe expand into others. Our position is the same. So our strategy basically, first of all, we definitely can do better in the categories that we already exist such as sparkling. So to give you some specific actions, we\u2019re taking to do that. I have highlighted the [LBTC] and that\u2019s actually accelerated. We have pilots running on various multi-serve and single serve packages for different price points in different parts of China. And as those things roll out of the pilot, we\u2019ll be rolling some of them nationally. So those are already in a way in the market and they will be accelerated into the second quarter. We\u2019ve also re-looked at our communication strategies and we\u2019re going to be communicating more intensely on the intrinsics of our products as well as extrinsics. You might have heard about our nickname promotions that the similar promotion to the Share a Coke promotion around the world outset which is getting incredibly positive reaction from the consumer. And all the other things of improving our route to markets et cetera, those are all under way and we\u2019re very confident that that\u2019s going to give us our strength in sparkling. Now, we also play in juices as you know and as Muhtar mentioned, we\u2019re the number one player there. We are refocusing our efforts back around Pulpy. And we\u2019re just looking at an extension of that into mango which is getting very strong consumer reaction. So as we consolidate our efforts behind that, you would see a continued increase. Now, obviously, we\u2019re not only focused on just our existing categories, we have a pretty successful brand in Super Milky Pulpy which is a value-added dairy. And we\u2019re beginning to increase our focus on that. And we\u2019re getting high single digits growth of that brand. And we are building our innovation pipeline for the future. So it\u2019s a fairly robust strategy and yeah, under lower economic environment, we might have lower growth rates than what you\u2019re used to. But we are ever strengthening our position in China to capitalize on this market for not just immediate future but to very long term.\nMuhtar Kent: We have Irial also, which oversees bottling investment group. And as you know, we are one of the three system players in China in terms of bottling maybe Irial you can comment on what you are seeing down very close to the ground.\nIrial Finan: Yeah. Judy, good morning. And just to build on something Muhtar said earlier which is around investment and I will tell you from a bottling perspective that we continue to invest heavily in the market, and particularly in our execution capability and route to market capability and critically in developing the talent to be successful in the next years ahead. So when you [ask all] today, we vitalize marketing strategies, OBPPC, I actually feel very confident about the future. Yes, Yes, we may have bumps along the way but our business is growing -- our challenge is to grow healthy long term business and I think from a bottling perspective, we\u2019re really putting in place the infrastructure and capability to really drive a success for the future and -- that\u2019s basically where I leave at.\nMuhtar Kent: Yeah, what I would just say finally is I wouldn\u2019t read anything more in this than what it is. As Gary said earlier, we were fractionally away from rounding up to 2 and we could -- it would not have been hard for us to do something which would not be right for this business and take the volume up to 3 and selling low cheap product. That is not what we are about. We are about investing, we are about doing the right things for this business and we are about -- and I have always said, there may be bump along the road, and at one bump along that we have grown this business consistently in line every year on an annual basis since 2008 on our way to our 2020 vision in the range and the upper range of our long-term growth plan despite very, very challenging macroeconomic conditions and that is going to happen in 2013 also.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.\nBill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: Just two quick questions, what are the trends like recently? It seems like you\u2019re pretty bullish in the back half. So as you exited June and got into July, it looks like some of the weather normalized. So what are you seeing more recently? And then kind of minutia but the big margin decline percentage year over year in Europe, what\u2019s the primary driver of that?\nMuhtar Kent: Yeah let me just comment on what you just said. We are not -- this is not about managing on a day -- yet we manage this business on an hourly basis, so it\u2019s not I think healthy to comment on what has happened in the last two weeks. Yes, of course, we expect the weather to normalize. As you -- or whoever is in the Northeast now, and whoever was in the West Coast of the United States in the last 10 days, you know that weather -- it has -- it does normalize. Matter of fact, that\u2019s the probability and statistics. So it just happened all in a very short period of time where everything was negative in many major markets. And it will normalize and that\u2019s what we are saying, part of what we are saying. So I have every confidence that -- the normalized conditions as I said we will again -- 2013 will be another year when volume will grow at the range of the long term growth model. As far as the margins are concerned, I will turn it over to Gary in terms of the margin is concerned, what you mentioned in terms of the margin numbers in Europe.\nGary Fayard: Yeah, in Europe its structural anomaly, it\u2019s actually Innocent. So when the juice business, juice having lower margin when it came in, that\u2019s what changed the margin. Just nothing more than that.\nBill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: I got you. But so they should be down going forward though because of that -- because of Innocent is now fully consolidated?\nGary Fayard: Yes. And that\u2019s actually the flip side, if you will, of what I said when I was answering John\u2019s question that if you look at the price inside of price mix in Europe it\u2019s actually plus two but it\u2019s really Innocent giving us a lift on price but it gives us opposite effect on the margin.\nBill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank: So it\u2019s something like a dollar margin perspective, it\u2019s almost neutral but the percentage has changed because of the price?\nGary Fayard: Yes, exactly right.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: Gary, just a question for you related to share repurchases. With the stock the way it's performed in the second quarter, did you accelerate or do anything different in terms of timing of maybe pulling forward share repurchases? And then I mean the business right now is kind of bouncing around the low end of your algorithm and the stock is kind of bouncing around in a pretty tight range here recently. So is there any consideration to maybe even buying back more stock than you originally planned just because you\u2019ve got an opportunity to buy it here at around the $40 level?\nGary Fayard: Yeah. Great question, Bryan. Well, first you\u2019ll see that we did accelerate purchases in the first half of the year. As I said, if our annual target was in the $3 billion to $3.5 billion range and we actually have repurchased $2 billion in the first half, we did exactly what you said and we accelerated in the first half of the year. Where we are right now is we\u2019re sticking with the annual target which we originally set at $3 billion to $3.5 billion. And I just tell you we\u2019ll give you an update on that at the end of the third quarter.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: Okay. But not out of the realm of possibility that you could go higher if you chose to\u2026\nGary Fayard: I have learnt to never say never to anything.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: All right. Thank you.\nGary Fayard: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel Nicolaus.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Yeah. Good morning everyone. Muhtar or Gary, question on the gross margin evolution. I think I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but it seems like one of the silver linings here is that the price pack architecture work you\u2019ve been doing over several years has allowed you to put up a pretty decent gross margin number and offset some of the corresponding earnings discipline that comes from the revenues being what they were in the quarter. If that is a fair assessment, can you give us a bit of an update on what\u2019s going on in terms of innovation, not in terms of the price, the pack but in terms of what\u2019s really in the bottle, because that seems to be one of the problems you are facing kind of from a larger share performance absolute NARTD performance perspective?\nGary Fayard: Okay. Perhaps Mark, let me take the margin question and then we can come back to the innovation question. But this is actually -- let me get back into actually what I talked about price mix and margins when I was talking about (inaudible). The same thing applies actually at a higher level for the total company. So what we\u2019ve got is very positive pricing and you\u2019re seeing that and that being offset by geographic mix. But what you\u2019re seeing is when an operation like North America is minus one in the quarter that actually -- this is counter intuitive but it actually improves margins, okay, because North America having the finished product business has lower margins. So our expectation is, number one, to continue to get positive pricing and we\u2019re going to be rational in pricing and we intend to say premium, as I said earlier. But in addition to that, we expect North America\u2019s performance to improve in the second half of the year which will actually put pressure on margins which is why we said earlier that we would expect gross margins to moderate over the second half of the year. And it\u2019s really the geographic mix of where the income is coming from. Does that \u2026\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: It does, yeah, but absolutely the geographic headwind is where at it is.\nGary Fayard: Yeah.\nMuhtar Kent: Yeah. I mean also on innovation I think, as we\u2019ve said before, we don\u2019t look at innovation only as ingredients. We look at it as packaging ingredients, equipment, even in terms of marketing social media, the brand price pack channel, architecture, occasion architecture. All of that is working for us and also in terms of our new campaign to be part of the solution around the world working closely with local governments, national governments, working with Government of Mexico, working with Mayors in Chicago and San Antonio, other parts of the United States in different states in Atlanta. You can look at the patents that we\u2019ve been filing off recent. So we are working and freestyle and the next generation of what is behind -- what\u2019s coming next after that. We are working on a host of new innovation. So also ingredients, continue to work with our partnerships across the world in different incubators around the world. The best we always believe here in the Coca-Cola Company, the best ideas are outside. So, the plant bottle came from the outside from one of the incubators in India. Many new ideas are coming from different incubators in Israel or in China or in Japan or in Latin America. We have many -- we have substantial partnerships from here with the University of Georgia to across many institutions around the world in Techno Parks. So, yeah, we are very active and we are content that we have the right pipeline and maybe I can ask Steve to reflect on from just a sort of North America and Americas perspective.\nSteve Cahillane: Yeah. Thanks, Muhtar. From a -- starting with the Latin America perspective, we have got Coca-Cola Light which we are picking up in Argentina, which we\u2019re excited about watching the prospects of that. We are doing some terrific innovation around our I Lohas platform in juices in Latin American, as well as in North America, we have launched Fruitwater, brand new product off to a very good start. Powerade Zero drops have joined Dasani drops is a very exciting innovation. (Inaudible) active which is a fusion between sports drink and energy kicked off in April, again off to a very good start. From a packaging perspective, we continue to innovate around our price-package architecture. We\u2019ve just launched 16 ounce sparkling IT cans in our major packages. We have got Taylor Swift slim cans coming into the marketplace. We have got 19.2 ounce sparkling cans coming into the marketplace, again lots of excitement around the packaging innovation. In terms of some marketing innovation, we have got Coke Zero which is going to be launched in college game day this fall which we are very excited about. We have got Cappy Free, Coke Zero coming into the marketplace. We feel very good about that, really building out the Coke Zero platform as an all-day brand. So we have got lots in the marketplace and lots more coming into the marketplace, and it builds on one of Muhtar's earlier points that throughout this rough period of time, we have continued our marketing pressure. We continued our marketing investment. We have not cut it, we have increased it and it allows us to continue to innovate and bring new innovation into the marketplace.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: That's helpful. If I could simply follow up on the subject of a stevia-based sweetener in the brand on the door so to speak, Coca-Cola we have seen what you have said recently about globally ticking down, the portion of your volume that is in the full cal portion of your business. Should we infer here that there is an increased resolve to use organic sweeteners against the main brand here and there is some optimism globally for that potential?\nMuhtar Kent: Yeah. I\u2019ll just comment on that that I think, it is all about ensuring that you provide the right portions at the right time for the right consumers in the right environment. And we -- I think that you should read that we have an increased resolve to use any specific ingredient. It is all about ensuring that we do have viable light and low-calorie versions for everyone of our major brands available to the consumer, ensure that we pack label transparently, ensure that we have active lifestyle programs as per all our global commitments and ensure that we have a responsible marketing. That's our -- those are full commitment. And our business, we have said many times, is about brand. Today, we have $16 billion brands, they are growing. We have in the pipeline another 19 brands that are bigger than $750 million in revenue and less than a $1 billion. Those all are going to become billion dollar brands in the next increment of time because they are growing and we are confident that we will have multiple billion -- more billion dollar brands than we have today. And I think that is what this business is all about, adding value through brands to our system and I\u2019m confident that you will see us add many more billion dollar brands to our roster in the near future.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Great. Thank you, gentlemen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.\nAli Dibadj - Bernstein: Hi, guys. So I think the general theme of my couple of question is really we are all trying to figure out, which is what's going to get better from here and why, and not only in terms of volume but also in terms of some of the other key drivers of profitability. So, if I may, my first question is around North America, and although you say in the press release you remain committed to rationale pricing, price mix is only at 1% and I guess, you think volumes would have been down more than negative 4%, if you have taken more than 1% pricing. So taking 2% to 3% pricing or can we hope for that part of the business, the pricing in North America improving going forward? And as a follow up to that and a completely different per cap market like China, moving up to Ahmet point second ago. I just want to get a better sense of if evolving a strategy has anything to do with increased price promotion as well as it sometimes does with some companies?\nMuhtar Kent: Steve do you want\u2026\nSteve Cahillane: Yeah. Thanks, Ali. I\u2019ll start. In terms of pricing, we\u2019ve always said that our pricing strategy in North America is consumer based and it continues to be consumer based. We captured, if you look at Nielsen, we captured very good pricing across our portfolio in North America. We think it was an appropriate amount of pricing by channel. The unfortunate 4% volume decline was, as we said, had a lot more to do with weather and the economy, at least 60% to 70% having to do with a one-time really poor weather events. So, we didn\u2019t put more price in the marketplace to try and chase volume that wasn\u2019t there. We put appropriate price increases in the marketplace and we maintained our margins and we maintained our price strategy going forward. And we continue to bring new products and new packages into the marketplace to help our whole architecture achieve the type of pricing that we deserve. And we have given some examples of this in the past and a good one is our 1.25 liter which continues to be very successful, a third of the 1.25 liter volume is in fact incremental volumes. So it's good in of itself, but it has also allowed us, if you look at our 2 liter pricing over the course of the past 12, 15 months, we are out of the $0.99 price promotion for 2 liter and has been for quite some time. So, we are not going to, we are not going to put too much price in the marketplace. We take appropriate price based on what the consumer and what is right for the consumer and what is right for the customer, and we fully expect that based on the price plans we have in place for the back half of the year, based on the innovations we have on the back half of the year that\u2019s sparkling volume will in fact improve from what happened in the second quarter.\nAli Dibadj - Bernstein: Okay.\nGary Fayard: Yeah. Ali, I\u2019d move on to your question on China. The answer is, there is absolutely no plans for increased price promotion. In fact, the reason for having an evolving OBPPC is to have more sustained volumes at the right price point and the right tax for all the consumers. Now, to give you an example, you might be familiar that there has been a lot of upsizing going on in China and we have launched our 300 ml package last year. Now, we will tactically respond to such upsizing to be able to balance our volume and share performance. But that\u2019s a -- those are limited practical moves rather than a strategy to have increased price promotions. So, that's not really in the cards. Now, to maybe build on this a little bit and also to address some of innovation questions, I didn\u2019t have a chance to share, is that, we have small can, either slim can or sleek can and small PET lounges all across the international territory, all across Europe, all across Eurasia-Africa Group and some of the Pacific markets. That, I believe, is an important innovation in a way and also allows us to drive revenue and gross margin. In addition to that, let also keep in mind that we have some very successful products such as Pulpy that hasn't been fully launched in all of our international territory. Eurasia-Africa Group, for example have taken that and they have launched it in Morocco in a very short period of time, we were able to achieve 20 plus percent market share with that launch. We've just had a recent launch of extensions of coffee into PET in Japan in the CVS channel recruiting female consumers. We are quite happy and pleased with the results of that. We have been innovating energy drinks in Russia and Turkey by expanding them into PET packages, re-sealable PET packages that the consumers want. So, we continue to innovate in different packages, different categories across our international territory, as well as using successful innovation from the previous years.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Jackson, Irial, Steve, Ahmet and Gary. Our business continues to grow and to capture global volume and value share even in the midst of ongoing global economic challenges. And importantly, we do not manage our business for the short-term but rather for the medium and long-term. And as I mentioned earlier, our focus on achieving our 2020 Vision is unwavering with current dynamics leading us to believe that our performance will be better in the back half of this year and beyond. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes today's conference.

Please look on our website for this information. Now, let me turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Jackson and good morning, everyone. Before we review this quarter's operating results, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the senseless events that took place in Boston yesterday. We were deeply saddened by this news and our thoughts and prayers are with those affected by this horrible tragedy. Now turning to this quarter's results. We are pleased with our first quarter performance. The great women and men of The Coca Cola Company, Coca Cola system delivered solid performance results in line with our expectations. On a global basis, we once again gained value share. We have now gained global value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages for 23 consecutive quarters. In spite of a challenging global economic times of the last few years, our people and our system bottling partners are executing the right strategies to advance us further towards our 2020 vision. Since the launch of our 2020 vision at the beginning of 2010, we have increased daily servings by more than 225 million, we have lifted global volume and value share to the highest levels since 2003, and more than $48 billion have been added to the Coca-Cola Company's market capitalization. Across the system, we are continuing to invest together for a better tomorrow. In fact, we enter 2013 and the fourth year of our journey to 2020 from a position of real strength clearly focused and well on track to reach our goals and objectives and our global bottling system is healthier than ever before. The strength of our brands and the promise of sustainable growth are fueling our bottlers' efforts to become more efficient, improve capability and further strengthen execution. We are working closely with our bottling partners around the world to rapidly realize opportunities to execute with precision and to continue winning at the point of sale. We are innovating and investing in the health of our brand, in our capabilities and in new opportunities for growth across the entire non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage landscape. We are leading the industry dialogue around obesity and strengthening the sparkling category by bringing forward new packaging choices, transparency in labeling and new sweetener solutions while also championing energy balance and promoting physical activity. We are working across the golden triangle of government, civil society and business to create real value and to make a lasting positive difference. And more importantly, we continue to generate shareowner value. To that end, in the first quarter of 2013, we grew worldwide volume by 4%, cycling 5% from prior year and once again captured global non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage value share with volume and value share gains in core sparkling category. Our global sparkling portfolio grew 3%, led by brand Coca-Cola growth of 3%, while Fanta grew 6% and Sprite grew 5%. Sparkling brands contributed nearly two-thirds of our global volume growth. Worldwide still beverage volume grew 6% in the quarter, with growth across most still beverage categories, including ready-to-drink tea, juices and juice drinks as well as packaged water. These gains enabled us to capture global still beverage volume and value share. And, immediate consumption volume also grew 3%, with growth across both, sparkling and still beverage. As announced during our 2012 year-end earnings call, we implemented a new organizational structure effective January 1st of this year that includes Coca-Cola Americas, which began 2013 by growing volume 3% and Coca-Cola International, which grew volume by 5%. Moving now to operating groups, I will start with North America, where we remain resolutely focused on driving sustainable growth. We are pleased to report that North America continued to build on three successive years of growth with 1% volume growth in the first quarter, resulting in volume and value share gains. We are winning by investing in our portfolio of preferred brands by executing with excellence at the point-of-sale and by creating efficiencies and synergies across our manufacturing sales and distribution networks. Although sparkling volume was down by 1% in the quarter, we achieved 3% sparkling price mix reflecting our focus on value creation. Importantly, brand Coca-Cola grew this quarter, aided by double-digit growth in both, mini cans and in our 1.25-liter package, underscoring the strength of our flagship brand and the success of our occasion-based package architecture. Coca-Cola also extended its favorite brand lead to over two times its closest competitor in North America. Sparkling beverages gained volume and value share as marketing and execution are enabling us to win in the marketplace. Still beverage volume grew 6% in the quarter, cycling 6% from prior year. Our portfolio of still beverage brands has now captured volume and value share for 21 of the past 23 quarters. Our key brands grew strong double digits and captured volume and value share of the ready-to-drink tea category. Growth was driven by Hones Tea at the premium end of the market, the ongoing rollout of Fuze which is now available in 70% of total U.S. supermarkets and continued Gold Peak growth. As you may know, we have built Gold Peak from scratch since launching it in 2006. The brand has grown by double digits for 24 consecutive quarters and is rapidly on its way to becoming a $1 billion brand. Our juice and juice drink portfolio grew 3% in the quarter gaining volume and value share, simply was up 9% thanks to the addition of new flavors and the growth in Simply Single-Serve. Our Minute Maid trademark grew 4% due to the expansion of Minute Maid punches as well as gains in the light segment of the chilled juice drink category. North America water business grew 5% led by growth of DASANI which continues to maintain a price premium to its primary competitors. Smart water maintained its streak delivering its 20th consecutive quarter of double digit growth. Now, energy portfolio delivered its 11th consecutive quarter of volume growth and gained volume and value share. As announced earlier today, we are taking a significant step towards our 2020 vision by commencing the implementation of a 21st century beverage partnership model in the United States. The franchise system has always been the strength of the Coca Cola business globally and today we are accelerating the transformation of our U.S. system in ways that will establish a clear path to help us achieve our 2020 vision. In the coming months, we will be collaborating with five of our bottling partners to implement a plan which will include the granting of exclusive territory rights and the sale of distribution assets with cold drink equipment. In the near term, production assets will remain with Coca Cola Refreshments which will facilitate future implementation of a national product supply system. These actions are being taken ahead of our previously stated timeline. The result will be further progress towards a more agile, modern, customer focused franchise business model unique to the United States. We remain confident that we have the right strategies for North America and we are optimistic about the outlook for this important critical market despite the challenging competitive environment and macroeconomic backdrop. As today's results indicate, The Coca Cola Company's brand marketing, commercial execution and category leadership efforts are all working together to enable us to sustainably win at the point of sale. Turning now to Latin America. We are building the business from a position of real strength having realized solid 4% volume growth in the quarter, cycling 5%. Sparkling beverages in Latin America grew 2% with brand Coca-Cola also up 2% enabling us to gain both volume and value share. Still beverages across Latin America delivered double-digit growth, gaining volume and value share thanks to growth across the portfolio including double digit growth for both Del Valle juices and juice drinks as well as POWERADE. In Mexico, brand Coca-Cola growth combined with high single-digit growth of our still brands helped drive overall volume growth of 3% in the quarter enabling us to capture volume and value share of nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. In Brazil, where volume also grew 3%, brand Coca-Cola delivered 2% growth while Fanta grew 8% and Del Valle delivered 15% growth enabling us to gain volume and value share in this important market. The Latin Fanta business unit, which stretches from Equador to Belize and encompasses the Caribbean grew volume by double-digits and trademark Coca-Cola expanded its leadership growing high single digits through consumer relevant propositions that include increasing availability of our 1.25 liter returnable glass bottle and expanding immediate consumption PET. We continue to see growth opportunities across Latin America which is the company's largest operating group in terms of unit case volume and where we have gained value share in 21 of the last 23 quarters. Moving now to the Pacific group. We generated 3% overall volume growth, cycling 9% from prior year, led by high single digit growth in brand Coca-Cola. At a country level, volume in China grew by 1%, cycling strong 9% growth. Sparkling beverages grew high single digits while the juice and juice drinks business grew by double-digits following the introduction of Minute Maid Pulpy PET and Minute Maid Pulpy Mango. This growth was partially offset by a decline in water volume as we cycled strong water growth. These results reflect sequential improvements and are in line with expectations we shared during our year end call. Importantly, we believe that we will continue to realize sequential improvements through 2013. At the same time, we also believe that it is going to take a period of time for consumption to return to the growth levels of previous years. Nevertheless, we had every confidence in the long-term resilience of our China business and we remain optimistic about our long-term opportunities to generate robust growth in this region over time. In Japan, volume growth was 1%, in line with expectations, cycling 3% growth from prior year. Sparkling growth was up mid single-digit led by trademark Coca-Cola, and in particular, Coca-Cola Zero up double digits driven by the successful Zero Limit national promotion. Ayataka green tea and LOHAS water our newest $1 billion-dollar brand in Japan continued their double-digit growth and contributed to solid growth in the important convenience store channel. Turning to India, which as a reminder we are now reporting within the Pacific group, we delivered high single-digit volume growth, cycling strong double-digit growth from last year and we gained volume and value share in sparkling while also increasing our pricing. Growth was led by brand Coca-Cola, which grew a strong 30% in the quarter. Thanks to a strong, robust integrated marketing and communications' campaign and strong in-market execution. In the first quarter alone, we added over 250,000 incremental outlets in India as significant increased chilled availability for our brands. Our still beverages in India grew mid-single digits, cycling strong double-digit growth while gaining both volume and value share. In concluding our update of the Pacific, I would also like to recognize our continued strong performance in two exciting markets, Thailand and South Korea. In Thailand, we are maintain double-digit volume growth while rapidly investing in additional two factories. We are working in close alignment with our local bottling partners to further expand our leadership position in this important market. In South Korea, we are generating broad-based growth across a diverse portfolio of strong brands with sparkling beverages growing high-single digits in the quarter led by brand Coca-Cola up 11%. Turning now to the Eurasia and Africa group, we once again delivered double-digit volume growth, growing 15% while maintaining share. Brand Coca-Cola grew double digits bolstered by our award-winning Crazy for Good campaign. Fanta, Sprite and Coke Zero, all generated double-digit growth as well. Our still brand delivered double-digit growth led by Fuze Tea and the acquired volume related to the Aujan partnership. Russia continued to deliver strong results, outpacing the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry with high single-digit volume growth. Growth was led by sparkling beverages, where we gained share for the eighth consecutive quarter as brand Coca-Cola grew 15%. Our still beverage portfolio gained volume and value share and Dobry juice continue its double-digit expansion. One highlight I would like to mentioned with regard to Russia, is our effort to deepen the emotional connection with the consumers by leveraging the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi. Our sponsorship of these games and the Torch relay will combine the passion of the Olympics spirit and Coca-Cola in the minds of millions of Russians as the porch will pass through thousands of Russians house. In fact, our activation of the porch really is already driving real connections to our consumers as evidenced by the more than 77,000 Torch bearer nominations we have received during our latest consumer promotion. Turning to our Central Asia business unit, also continued a strong performance delivering double-digit growth in the quarter. Prior to concluding my update on Eurasia and Africa, I would like to note that the Middle East and North Africa business unit was recently awarded the company's Woodruff Cup. This is our most prestigious operating award honoring the top performance business units in our worldwide business system. Among other important accomplishments, the Middle East and North Africa business unit achieve double-digit volume and operating income growth for 2012. We celebrated an important milestone with our partners at Aujan this quarter, as we toasted the billionth can of Rani juice produced since the start of our partnership. Rani is the leading juice brand in the Middle East and a terrific compliment to our existing juices in Eurasia and Africa, including Turkey which gained volume and value share for 10th consecutive quarter. Turning now to Europe. The economic environment clearly remains uncertain across this region as persistent high unemployment, coupled with severe austerity measures are weighing on consumer sentiment and consumer spending. In fact, Nielson's latest global survey of consumer confidence and spending intentions indicate the consumer confidence fell in 20 of the 29 European markets in the fourth quarter of last year. Nevertheless our volume was even in the quarter cycling 1% growth from prior year which is a significant sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of last year. We grew volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages, both sparkling beverages across the region including key markets like France, Germany and Great Britain. There were pockets of volume growth across Europe with Germany growing a healthy 3%, the Nordic countries showing improvement and Great Britain returning to growth while gaining share due to strong integrated marketing campaigns and solid execution in the market place. For the near future, as European consumers remain cautious in their spending, we will keep investing for the long-term health of our business. These results from around the world underscore the laser focus that our system has on our strategic priorities as we advance further towards our 2020 vision. Our five core strategic priorities are as follows. First, we must continue to grow sustainably and provide meaningful solutions that enhance the health and well-being of the communities we proudly serve. Second, we will win with Coca-Cola while actively promoting the brand and the category. Third, we must absolutely keep winning and executing with excellence at the point-of-sale. Fourth, we need to keep maximizing the value of our global beverage portfolio. Sixth, we will encourage and inspire our system and associates to deliver on our mission. Looking back at the first quarter of 2013, we were also honored and humbled to receive several recognitions. We were again ranked number four on Fortune's list of Most Admired Companies and named one of the Most Innovative Companies in the World by FastCompany. Also one of the most meaningful recognitions for the Coca-Cola system came from Catalyst, the leading nonprofit organization with a mission to expand opportunities for women in business. We were honored to accept the 2013 Catalyst Award in recognition of our global women initiative. This important initiative is focused on fuelling the advancement of women as dynamic leaders and entrepreneurs across the organization and also in communities throughout the world where we serve our customers and consumers. Before moving on, I want to revisit a complex societal issue that touches us all, obesity. Beginning last year, The Coca-Cola Company took new steps to give consumers even more choices in packet sizes, sweeteners and beverages, including more low and no calories production while also providing clear nutritional information and by supporting fitness programs. Coca-Cola has a rich heritage of being associated with exercise, sports and active lifestyle. Today we are using our marketing expertise and community connections to inform consumers about energy balance and to inspire more people to get moving. We firmly believe the challenges of obesity are solvable. The Coca-Cola system together with industry partners, NGOs and government is committed to being part of the solution. In closing, I would like to reiterate that our brands are stronger than ever before. We delivered solid performance results this quarter in line with our expectations while continuing to gain global value share. Together, with our global system bottling partners, we are working diligently to unlock value, to execute with precision and to continue gaining volume and value share. We are leading the industry dialogue about obesity by bringing forward solutions, adding transparency to dialog around calories and championing energy dollars and physical activity. We are generating value for our shareowners as evidenced by the recently announced 10% increase in our annual dividend, which is our 51st consecutive annual dividend increase. Even so, we remain constructively discontent as we seek to make the most of the growth opportunities we continue to see around the globe. Please note that we are working each and every day to refresh the world, inspire moments of happiness and optimism, create value and make a meaningful difference in lives of our consumers, our customers and in the communities that we proudly serve. With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary.\nGary Fayard: Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning everyone. We delivered solid results this quarter underscoring once again that our company and global system are well positioned to execute our strategic plans and alignment with our 2020 vision. Achieving such consistent performance during a time of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty is a real testament to the strength of our global system and the investments we continue to make for long-term sustainable growth. Before we get into the financial details of the quarter, let me remind you that we closed the sale of 51% of our bottling business in the Philippines to Coca-Cola FEMSA in January of this year and therefore we no longer are consolidating the Philippines results. We anticipate that this transaction along with the previously announced, bottling merger in Brazil will have a 3% structural impact on our full year 2013 net revenues, likewise our full year operating results should see a 1% structural impact. However, there should be a corresponding improvement to equity income, to our share of the results of these operations moving forward. As I shared in our 2012 year-end call, we do not expect these transactions to have a material impact on our 2013 earnings results. Moving now to our first quarter results, our comparable earnings per share were $0.46, up 5% versus the prior year quarter despite currency headwinds of approximately 4%. Our comparable currency-neutral operating income was up 5% despite the impact of two fewer selling days and the impact of certain structural items. Currency was a 3% headwind on top on comparable operating income. Comparable currency neutral net revenue grew 1% and grew 2% after adjusting for the impact of structural items. After adjusting for the effects of two fewer selling days in the quarter, unit case sales were in line with concentrate sales. Price mix for the quarter was even, cycling 3% in the prior year quarter, and remember in the second quarter, we will also be cycling 3% price mix. However stated in our last earnings call, we expect to earn low single-digit consolidated price mix for 2013, consistent with our long-term growth model. We continue executing our occasion-based brand, price package and channel strategies with precision around the world. Our comparable gross margin was 61.5%. This represents a slight improvement compared to the prior year, primarily due to the impact of geographic mix, the consolidation of the Philippines bottler and the impact of our foreign currency hedging program. We expect the improvement in our gross margin to moderate over the remainder of the year due to a shift in geographic mix. With regards to operating expense leverage, we achieved three points of favorable operating leverage in the quarter, despite the impact of two fewer selling days at the end of was primarily due to the deconsolidation of the Philippines bottler as well as the benefit from a reversal of expenses related to some of our long-term incentive plans. This was partially offset by sustained strategic investments in our brand building activities around the world. As we have shared before, we continue to expect operating expense leverage to be even to slightly positive for the full year. As you model our 2013 operating results and our corresponding expense leverage, let me also remind everyone that the 2013 calendar will have one less day when compared to 2012 and based on our quarterly closing calendar, as I said, we had two less days this quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2012 and our fourth quarter of 2013 will have one more day when compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. Moving now to net interest income. We came in at $14 million of income in this quarter, ahead of our initial forecast. We now expect net interest will be event to slightly positive for the remainder of the year. Our underlying effective tax rate is 23.5%. We expect this rate to remain unchanged through 2014. Cash flow from operations decreased 3% primarily due to the impact of the two fewer selling days in the period and unfavorable impact from currency and an increase in the use of working capital in preparation for the peak season of our growing global business. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we expect our cash flow growth rate to be more in line with our earnings growth rate. Turning to share repurchase. Our net share repurchases during the quarter totaled approximately $1.1 billion. This places us well on track to achieve the $3 billion to $3.5 billion range for full year 2013 that we communicate during our last earnings call. As for currencies, we remain fully hedged on the Euro, Yen and Sterling for 2013 and into 2014 and we also have near term coverage in place with several other currencies. After considering the hedged positions and current spot rates, we expect currencies to be a 3% headwind for the second quarter and a 2% headwind for the full year. As you have all seen the movement of Yen in recent months, as mentioned, we have hedged our Yen exposure for this year and into next year but we do believe that the weaker Yen will ultimately be beneficial for the Japanese economy and for our business. In closing, and as Muhtar shared earlier, we are delivering on our strategic priorities and achieving real success. We fully expect operating income to be in line with our long-term growth target for the full year. Our global system is committed to investing together for a better tomorrow and our proven ability to achieve consistent quality results provides us with a confidence that together, as a system, we will successfully crack the code to sustainable growth to meet our 2020 vision goals. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question is from John Faucher with JPMorgan Chase. Mr. John, you can continue with your question.\nJohn Faucher - JPMorgan Chase: Sorry, there is a lot of static. As you look at the bottler consolidation piece, is Spanish or Japanese bottler consolidation the beginning of the next wave of let's say a bottler-driven consolidation? And how much are you pushing this as opposed to letting the bottlers lead where the system is going?\nMuhtar Kent: Hi, John, good morning. This is Muhtar. First, I think, its important to realize that there is not one model for the world. There is many different models for the world. As you can see, what's happening. This has been an exciting last several months with respect to the evolution, actually continuous evolution of our franchise system. We manage our business to create sustainable long-term value and evolution of our franchise system continues to play an absolutely critical role in that process. So what you have seen recently, the Contal merger in Japan, the Brazil merger of three bottling partners creating a large Brazilian led bottling business, the Iberian merger of seven bottling partners in Iberia, the sale of the Philippines, of the majority shares of the Philippines and the control to FEMSA, and now the U.S. the process, the journey starting in the United States are all part of our vision, our plan and to ensure that we can continue to deliver on the commitments we made for our vision. In some cases they use, partially, our capital. In some cases whether the sale of, obviously, we bring capital back into the Coca-Cola Company, but all the time ensuring that our bottling business is fully suited with the needs of 21st century delivering what is necessary ahead of consumer expectations, customer expectations and so not one-size-fits-all. And in the case of the United States, again, we are pleased to report today that we have reached agreement in principle to start this journey. All along since the first day we've closed the transaction of the Coca-Cola Refreshments, I have always said there will be a meaningful role to invite partners back into the business. When we were asked about the timing, we've always said around the four-to-five year timeframe from the time we've closed - the close of Coca-Cola Refreshments was you will recall back in the latter part of 2010, and we are well within that timeline and it's a continuous evolution and sometimes it will necessitate for us to use our own capital, sometimes the mix and sometimes no capital and again not one-size-fits-all. The U.S. model is a very different, but it is again a model that invites partners to serve with us passionately, the communities that we operate in.\nJohn Faucher - JPMorgan Chase: Great. If I could just as a follow-up on that, which would be as you look at the different options you gave for the U.S. pieces here in terms of sub-bottler agreements, asset sales, swaps, things like that, is there some way to think about the financial impact as you do this? I mean, this is a small piece of it. How long does this timeframe take out as you sort of push these U.S. pieces out? Thanks.\nMuhtar Kent: Yes. I think we can't comment on the timing for the end game but all I can tell you is that we are intent on creating the evolution necessary for us to be able to serve both, our large customers and small independent customers in the best possible way with our bottling partners. Again, we have always said right from the beginning and we are consistent to that that the U.S. will be slightly different. We want to create the best-in-class production, optimum cost production system coast-to-coast from the east to the west. That will be nationally managed. We also want to create a national, we managed a larger customer, management system that will essentially have the responsibility to put together of 21st century customer plan with our large partners in the United States, or at the same time invite partners to come in and be part of this new evolution in the United States. It will take as long as it is necessary, and that is not our focus; it's going to be about doing the right thing as quickly as possible, as efficiently as possible and as effectively as possible and that's what we are going to be doing.\nMuhtar Kent:\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: Hi, good morning. A question for you, Gary, just on the on the operating leverage in the in the first quarter and maybe more specifically the gross margin. If I understood it right, this quarter would have been one of the highest in terms of the impact from commodity inflation and we also really had no positive benefit from price mix. And as we kind of look out going forward, right? We should get some benefit from price mix later in the year and maybe you some relief on commodity inflation. So, why would not there be maybe more leverage going through the year than we originally expected given the leverage you had in the first quarter?\nGary Fayard: Yes, Bryan, thanks. There are a couple of things to consider. First is, as I mentioned previously in the prepared remarks, that we reversed some compensation accruals in the first quarter. So that gave you more leverage in the quarter but you will not see that that\u2019s more of one-time impact, if you will. So its more leveraged in the quarter. The other significant piece is, the currencies had an impact as well and currencies are moderate going out. But the biggest thing will be geographic mix. We would expect to see geographic mix changing throughout the year as we go through the year. As that happens, it will have an impact on gross margin and operating leverage.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: So the geographic mix would be more negative going through the back half of the rest of the year?\nGary Fayard: Yes, that\u2019s exactly right. In fact, think about North America. Actually I would expect North America, actually, in the first quarter of this year, North America's operating income on a recurring comparable basis was down 3% and it is down 3% primarily because of two fewer selling days. So if you adjusted for those selling days it would have been positive. But I would expect North America to actually improve versus where they were, minus 3%, but as they improve because it's a finished products business, it is going to have a negative gross margin impact and there will be reduced leverage.\nGary Fayard:\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: Okay, so more growth from lower margin geographies going forward and that will affect that margin impact?\nGary Fayard: That is what I was trying to say, more in code than the prepared remarks.\nGary Fayard:\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America: All right, thank you.\nGary Fayard: We normally don't think North America, but that\u2019s what it was.\nGary Fayard:\nOperator: Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley: Good morning. I was hoping you can update on the competitive environment around the world both in China and Western Europe which have been hotspots recently. Also, just your thoughts around how you manage the pricing environment in the U.S. Sparkling business in 2013 and beyond in light of the moderate commodity pressure and if that solid 3% sparkling growth we saw in Q1 can continues in the balance of the year?\nMuhtar Kent: This is Muhtar. We haven\u2019t seen anything markedly different from previous quarters as far as the competitive environment is concerned. China remains a very competitive environment. Actually the whole world, and again this is a competitive environment that is the mix of large international companies but also very much local companies in Asia, in parts of Africa, in the Middle East. We also see a somewhat more rational pricing,-particularly, in Europe as well as other parts of the world, in Latin America too. So the way we see the environment is it will continue to be challenged from a consumer perspective. Whether you are talking about Asia coming back or whether you are talking about consumer sentiment in Europe will continue to be volatile and mixed at best, and therefore pricing is going to critical and therefore also ensuring leverage and ensuring productivity that can be generated out of operations for us to be able to continue to invest. It's going to be critical. But we are intent on continuing to invest in this environment. I will let Steve Cahillane talk a little bit about how we manage the pricing environment in the United States (inaudible) Price mix, 3%, in terms of a leverage in pricing for sparkling beverages in the past quarter.\nSteve Cahillane: Thanks, Muhtar. We have seen a rational pricing environment in the United States over the course of a good period of time right now. We would expect that to continue. I have said many times that if commodities go down, don\u2019t look for us to reinvest that in price. We have worked very hard to earn the price that we take in the marketplace. We don\u2019t have an affordability problem in the United States with our sparkling beverages. We would love to continue to invest behind our brands. We have got a terrific summer program for the Coca-Cola brand. We have got an exciting new partnership with Taylor Swift around Diet Coke. We will invest around activating those types of programs that continue to focus on one of our most important objective which is to continue to support, development and drive our sparkling category inside the United States business.\nDara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bill Pecoriello of Consumer Edge Research\nBill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research: Good morning, everybody. I wanted to follow up on the U.S. filing announcement. Onto the production assets for the territories the five bottlers picked up. Do you see these bottlers eventually contributing to manufacturing assets into a national production company to get at the cost savings opportunity that you talked about in the manufacturing side? And also, would Coke be willing to let new partners bringing outside capital to help finance some of the additional territory sales given the size of the territory that Coke still holds onto in the U.S.? Thanks.\nMuhtar Kent: Hi, Bill. This is Muhtar. Good morning. I'd say to you that this is again, we are at the beginning of this journey. We have reached agreement in principle with these five U.S. bottling partners. It is very important that we did reach that agreement in principle and now we can actually ensure that we put all the details into motion and we can implement effectively. We have always said production in the United States is critical to our success in achieving a optimum cost 21st century production system nationally manage, coast-to-coast. That is going to take place. We've also said that managing large, 30 or so of our largest customers in the United States as going to be done nationally. That's also going to take place. In terms of who else would be coming in, can't comment on that in terms of what will happen and what form and architecture production is going to take place in terms of what our current bottlers own. I can't comment on that. All I can tell you and I can assure you that we are intent on ensuring that we make the necessary changes in the format and architecture production to achieve what I just said which is a coast-to-coast nationally run production system that generates the efficiencies, synergies, productivity that allow us to continue to win in the marketplace. And again, there may be a future where our partners in the United States take certain ownership in the national production. I wouldn't rule that out also, but it will be managed nationally from one point, single point.\nBill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Good morning. I just had a couple of questions on North America. First, in terms of volume performance, I think the macro data points and consumer data points have been a little bit choppy more recently. So maybe if you can give us a little bit color just in terms of category of your performance, immediate consumptions versus take home, and so do the expectation as you get out into the back half of the year lapping up some of the transitory headwinds whether it's in payroll taxes or weather related if you expect volumes performance to improve? Then, Gary, just on the profitability in North America, I know you talked about this a little bit, but I look at first quarter, you had 1% volumes growth, 2% price mix and you did say profitability was up a little bit, but why aren't we seeing the profitability really improve more meaningfully and sort of what drives the sequential acceleration in North America profitability going forward?\nMuhtar Kent: Okay. Judy, I'll have Steve answer the first part of your question before Gary comes in and sheds some light on the question on profitability. Steve?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. Thanks, Judy. First quarter clearly had a lot of a noise in it. We expected a benefit from Easter being in the first quarter. It's never as big a benefit when it comes that early in the year. Easter is always better when it comes later in April, because of the warmer weather, but obviously you referenced the weather. We saw some very dramatic changes. Last year, we benefited from one of the hottest winters, warmest winters in the United States, and we cycled that with one of the coldest winters in the United States. So, clearly, that had an effect and we saw any benefit from Easter really being washed away, if you like, by the poor weather. There was clearly an effect in the payroll tax. It's a little bit of art and science trying to pick apart what's weather and what's payroll tax. We would figure about two thirds is probably weather-related and one-third of the slowdown is based on the economy. We are go optimistic. Guardedly optimistic that the consumers are coming back. That the payroll tax and the economy is kind of a short-term need to get used to the discretionary impact that it has had. So we remain optimistic that we have got the right programs in place, that the economy is on the mend and we would expect continued good performance as we go out the next three quarters. In terms of question of profitability, I will turn it over to Gary.\nGary Fayard: Judy, I would say a couple of things on profitability. Its really kind of repeating what Steve just said. If you take the first quarter and you throw in lousy weather, payroll tax, actually the price of gasoline, what then does to your immediate consumption versus future consumption business is going to have an impact on your profitability. Now, if I go back to the answer I gave to Brian earlier though, when I saw that geographic mix that is North America, I would expect North America to be improving actually from the first quarter and from where we were. Then North America also has this two fewer days. Now, I can tell you, Steve has got a number from minus 3%. I say it would have been positive. Steve has got a number but you can calculate it several different ways as to what would the impact of the two days be. We would all agree, I think, it is positive. They would have been positive as to operating income line. But you put all that together, the weather, by the way is as lousy as it has been and the impact on Steve's business has been given a lot of moisture to the Midwest for the drought for the corn crop. So they look for commodities and we will see what happens there. Payroll taxes, consumers hopefully are starting to get used to it. Gasoline prices, looks like they are starting to trend down somewhat. So I think there is some reason to be cautiously optimistic. CCR continues to execute with excellence and continue to improve capability. So I think the there are lots of reasons to be optimistic on North America.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay, but from a profitability perspective, though, the bigger delta is really the mix shifting towards more immediate consumption as weather normalizes? Or is there a step up in cost savings or timing of marketing investments that help the profitability?\nGary Fayard: Judy, I would actually say, the biggest impact on the first quarter North America was two less selling days by far, and the whole company as well. But by far, the biggest impact was the two selling days.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay.\nSteve Cahillane: Judy, I can answer this part of your question. The secondary impact is clearly weather impacted food service and immediate consumption more than the take home channel. So we would expect as weather moderates, those profitable parts of our business will start to normalize as well. But as Gary said, two less selling days when you got the fixed cost assets that we have in the North American business is really quite significant. Those extra two days are golden cases that are going out and when you lose those two days, it obviously has a big impact.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Got it, okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Caroline Levy of CLSA.\nCaroline Levy - CLSA: Good morning, Muhtar, Gary and team. I would like to just understand, Muhtar, your vision, again going back to the United States. You talked a little bit about how manufacturing is going to evolve. A little bit of understanding the benefits of margin the operations of food service, your noncarbs and your CSCs into one production facility. Just can that actually be done and are there synergies there? Then secondly, do you feel strongly that your own people have to get the product to market from the plant or could you use a third-party, such as assister?\nMuhtar Kent: Yes, Caroline, I think first in terms of our capability in our system in the United States is, I would say, the best in the consumer products world in terms of how we go to market and how we can get the product from production facilities. So I wouldn't like to comment on how we can improve that. If there is a way for us to even improve and generate more productivity we will certainly look at it. I think the most important thing though is that there is room to generate significant further synergies in production. I think today I wouldn\u2019t say that the United States production system after three years of having integrated Coca-Cola Refreshments, it is where we needed to be and we need to continue on that roadmap to proceed towards a modern and best-in-class optimum cost production system coast-to-coast. That will mean obviously a lot of changes, that will mean building new plants, that will mean combining some facilities, but I would like to also comment in terms of hot-fill and aseptic versus sparkling beverage plants, we will look at ensuring that we have the most modern, most productive facilities in place. I don't believe the answer is to combine all under one roof. I think the answer is to combine many that are scattered across the country both, in terms of still and sparkling separately into some consolidation process and I can't comment any further. What I can tell you is that there is room for cost to come down, there is room for efficiencies to increase and we will achieve all of those. This is all in line with our 2020 vision. We laid out a plan, when we took over the business of Coca-Cola Enterprises, we laid out a plan when I took over as the CEO back four and a half years ago and we are executing it meticulously and we are doing what we have said we would do and we are doing it ahead of time.\nCaroline Levy - CLSA: That's excellent. I was just wondering in terms of getting shelf space, you see a big opportunity in up and down the street and to get better pricing much as you've done in Lat-Am. I'm often asked how you compete with all the new things that come in, be it, coconut water, energy drinks. I know you have some, but are you convinced you can keep or improve shelf space for your carbonated soft drinks?\nMuhtar Kent: Absolutely. I think, we can improve service levels. I think, we can improve execution inside the point of sale. I think, we can improve availability. I think, we can improve availability of cold drink. I think, we can improve how we serve independent, and all of those things are going to be played out as we implement and execute this new strategy in the United States. And, I don't know, Steve, do you want to comment?\nSteve Cahillane: No. I agree completely and part of what we are doing with this new bottler arrangement focuses on that up and down the street where bottlers and CCR add the most value which is not only big customer sales, but up and down the street execution and we have got also our venturing and emerging brands unit which you are familiar with which brings brands like Zico coconut water. It brought Honest Tea. So, in that, those spaces that you are talking about we are very much innovating, we've got glaceau fruitwater which we just launched with great success a couple of weeks ago. That's being executed not only in the large stores, but importantly in the up and down the street foodservice, on-premise accounts as well, so we see that as a very important capability. We see ourselves as having a competitive advantage there when it comes to not just shelf space, but cold drink space and overall availability.\nMuhtar Kent: Yes. And just to finally add on to that point, Caroline, the rest assured we are in an mode of evolution, rapid evolution, not just in the United Sates, across the whole world, and you will see us adapting, reinventing, how we go to market, how we serve customers and also how we communicate with consumers, very importantly. Our brands are at an all time high in terms of health and we will continue again to evolve and bring out the best modes of communications with our consumers as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Yes. Thanks, good morning, everyone. Also a question on the U.S. refranchising, Muhtar or Gary, you talk about this new beverage agreement being ultimately what's at Play here. Could you speak a little bit to how you are thinking about that and the role of incidence-based pricing in that? Is it right to think that continues to have prominence in this new agreement? Any distinction you might draw between how stills and carbonates are treated as you move production more squarely to staying, if you will, at least for a little while inside Coca-Cola?\nMuhtar Kent: Yes, I think Mark, we can't comment on the detail. What we can say is that it will be a model that will align us fully with our bottling partners to do what is right in the marketplace and to focus on what is right in the marketplace, a full alignment model and I think I can't just comment any further than that but you will see us executing better, serving the customers better with a better production template, as well as a customer service template.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Is it fair to think that other markets, there is a fact pattern and experience set to draw in as you implement this newer form of agreement here in the U.S.?\nMuhtar Kent: I think all of that will come into play, best practices, everywhere around the world. I am certain that in four or five years' time, many people will come into the United States to see the best practices as it used to be back in the 1980s when I used to bring new bottlers from Eastern Europe to see best practices in the United States at that time.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Fair enough. Thanks, Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: In closing, I would like to thank Gary, Ahmet, Steve, Irial and Jackson and to again say that we are pleased with our solid first quarter. We are working as a system to unlock real value, further strengthen execution and to win at the point-of-sale. We are confident that a relentless focus on growth will enable us to build capable, resilient optimized advantage and sustainable systems that are well-positioned to deliver results in 2013 and achieve our 2020 Vision. As always, we thank you for your interest and your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call with The Coca-Cola Company.

Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent : Thank you, Tim and good morning everyone. During our last Earnings call we articulated 5 strategic actions to reignite our growth and committed to providing you an update on our progress as we move forward and into 2015. So today, I'm going to start with some highlights from our fourth quarter performance and then review the progress we've made against our 5 strategic actions. For those of you following our Web cast, you can see our quarterly performance on our new scorecard on Slide 4. Overall, our performance came in slightly ahead of where we had previously expected. This was driven by some net positives above the operating income line slightly offset by higher than expected returns to remeasurement impacting profit before tax. As the top line structurally adjusted comparable currency neutral net revenues grew 4% in the quarter driven by a balance between volume and underlying price mix in what was a challenging macro environment.  At the profit level, structurally adjusted comparable currency neutral operating income grew 7% in the quarter, while we continue to invest heavily behind our media with double digit increases in the quarter and full year. Importantly, there are some highlights for the quarter. We continue to focus pricing and revenue realization in key developed markets with North America and Europe both delivering positive price mix in the quarter and for the full year. Our core strategies and our diversified global portfolio enables us to gain global value share in non-alcoholic ready to drink Sparkling beverages as well as Still beverages in the quarter. This is a key metric for us particularly in a challenging macro environment. As we announced last week, we also continue to strengthen our overall portfolio\u2019s billion dollar brand and in particular our Still brands. Gold Peak, a premium tea brand in the United States benefited from great marketing, strong media and stepped up execution to achieve this status. Furthermore FUZE TEA, our popular mainstream tea brand now available in nearly 40 markets around the world reached this status in less than three years demonstrating the strength of our systems marketing and executional capabilities. And finally, LOHAS our innovative water brand in Japan regained billion dollar brand status in 2014. This brings our total number of billion dollar brands to 20 out of which 14 are Still brands. Just five years ago we had 14 billion dollar brands. Since 2010 on average we\u2019ve added more than one new billion dollar brand each year to the list.  Stepping back from our quarterly performance I would like to talk about the bigger picture in 2014 a year of significant change for our company that will continue in 2015. Specifically I want to discuss our five strategic actions to reignite our which are first; targeting disciplined brand and growth investment, Second; driving revenue and profit growth with clear portfolio roles across our market, Thirdly; refocusing on our core business model, Fourth; driving efficiency through more aggressive productivity and fifth -- last but not least streamline and simplify our organization.  While we're making solid progress we have more to do. In 2014 we invest significantly in both our brands and in incremental growth opportunities. We substantially increased our media investment in markets and categories where our media was underfunded relative to the market opportunity, where we had the right price tag, channel architectures and where we had clear executional alignment with our bottlers. The quality of our media has been increasing and we intend to improve it even further under the leadership of our new global Chief Marketing Officer Marcos de Quinto.  We're seeing initial success as exemplified by North America where our incremental media investments coupled with our segmented price tag strategies drove revenue growth in our Sparkling portfolio through strong 4% price mix in the second half of the year. This gives us confidence that when we invest in our brands, align on our system plans and focus on execution we do see positive results.  And looking beyond our existing portfolio we continue to focus on expanding our participation across a range of consumption [occasions]. Today the average household globally consumes 26 beverages per day and of these 26 beverages only 1.4 are Coca-Cola company brand. Our opportunity to capture more beverage [occasions] is just immense. And for that reason we've announced strategic investments in Keurig Green Mountain and Monster Beverage Corporation both of these investments underscore not only our ability to adapt to changing consumer trend but also our commitment to accelerate innovation.  Next we expanded our market segmentation recognizing that each of our markets has a specific role in order to sustainable revenue growth. Some markets focus on price realization, others on volume and the remainder on the balance of the two. Importantly our proxy statement will be coming out in the coming weeks and you will see the revised intensive metrics which will add revenue growth directly aligned to those market roles.  We also made headways in refranchising our bottling operations both in the United States and internationally. In North America we closed several refranchising transactions in 2014 and laid out a clear path and timeline to refranchise the remaining territories. Specifically, we refranchised territories representing approximately 5% of the U.S bottler-delivered business in 2014 and have already signed definitive agreements to continue refranchising a similar amount in the first half of 2015.  These agreements along with our ongoing work give us confidence that we will continue to accelerate our rate of refranchising each year and achieve our goal to retain a maximum of about one-third of the U.S bottler-delivered business by the end of 2017. And it is our intent to refranchise the remaining territories by 2020 at the latest. As we reached the end phase in North America these actions will drive higher operating margins, lower capital spending and invested capital and improve the ROIC for our company.  Outside of North America we announced two transformative changes to our bottling landscape in critical high growth markets around the world. First in Indonesia we announced a joint venture in Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia that will help our system to capture the long-term opportunity in this extremely attractive emerging market. We also entered into an agreement to re-architect our African bottling system with the creation of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa which will serve 12 Southern and East African countries and will be a top ten global bottler once the transaction is completed.  Importantly, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa will have the scale, resources and efficiencies to fund the investment required to capture the strong long term growth potential in Africa. These markets will be long term growth engines for our company so it is absolutely critical that we invest sufficiently today to prime those engines for decade to come. In order to reinvest our business and deliver against our long term financial targets we embarked upon an expanded productivity plan that will result in a total $3 billion in annualized savings by 2019. As Kathy discuss in detail during our modeling call in December this represents the significant reduction to our investable spend base and our efforts are on track. As you\u2019ve seen in the press we've began work on reducing positions that are no longer aligned to our growth priorities or are deemed redundant as we streamline our operation. While this is never an easy process, it is absolutely essential to ensuring that our business is wired for greatest speed, responsiveness as well as innovation. And importantly, it also frees up the resources we need to reinvesting in the business to accelerate our growth. Fifth and finally towards the end of 2014 we begin the process of streamlining and simplifying our operating model. We announced the streamlining of group functional layer and began standardizing the key processes across our business units. This will not only reduce our cost structure but more importantly will create a more nimble organization that is wired to act swiftly and rapidly in today's dynamic landscape. In summary, I am confident that these strategic actions are laying the grand work for accelerated top and bottom line growth in the future and delivering the long term shareowner value you expect. Looking ahead we will continue to make progress against our actions to regain momentum. But as we\u2019ve said before 2015 will be a transition year for the company as we implement our new operating model and our incremental media investments in both 2014 and 2015 taking time to pay off in full. Further we expect the global consumer environment to remain volatile, geo-political hotspots around the world and potential deflation environment in Europe and continued softness in many emerging and developing markets around the could to be partially offset by an improving environment in the United States.  So against this back drop what remains to be seen is how quickly and to what extent lower oil prices trickle down to impact consumer discretionary spending in both importing as well as oil exporting nations. Therefore we will focus on what we can control; we will implement our strategies with focus and conviction, investing for the long term in emerging market as well as taking advantage of opportunities to solidify our position in the growth market of today and tomorrow. While in 2015 we expect to grow comparable currency neutral EPS mid-single digit, from 2016 on we intend to be back to delivering again a long term target of high single digit comparable currency neutral EPS growth. We will strengthen our leading brands through incremental media investments and best in class marketing campaign. We will deliver a [net] change in productivity and complete the majority of North America franchising both of which will drive growth and improve our margin structure. And finally we will continue to enhance our marketing leading capabilities to provide our customers and consumer with the innovative and refreshing product they expect from the Coca-Cola Company.  I will now hand the call to our Chief Financial Officer Kathy Waller who will provide you with a more detailed look at our financial performance as well as the outlook on our business for 2015.\nKathy Waller: Thank you Muhtar and good morning everyone. Our performance in the fourth quarter was slightly ahead of our expectations due primarily to three factors. First, several markets around the world delivered slightly better top line performance thanks to a strong finish during the holiday season. Second, gross margin came in slightly better than anticipated and third, operating expenses were lower than expected which led to comparable currency neutral margin expansion. We are pleased with where the quarter landed. Structurally adjusted comparable currency neutral revenue growth was driven by 3% growth in concentrate shipment and 2% underlying price mix. Concentrate shipment outpaced unit cases in the quarter driven by an extra selling days. However for the full year concentrate shipment were in line with unit cases. Consolidated price mix in the quarter was driven by pricing initiatives in North America, Latin America and Europe. Importantly as we've done throughout 2014 we continue to invest the behind our brand. During the quarter our marketing expenditures grew high single digit resulting in mid-single digit growth for the year. This increase in annual marketing expenditures was driven by a double digit increase in media investment as we continue to drive efficiencies within our overall marketing budget to put against our media spend. Our fourth quarter comparable EPS was $0.44 which included a 10 point currency headwind. On a comparable currency neutral basis our EPS grew 5% in both the quarter and the full year. Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to the impact of changing the exchange rate used to measure our Venezuela subsidiaries, net monetary assets into U.S. dollars, a write down on the competent sales receivable from our bottling partner in Venezuela, non-cash charges related to refranchising certain territories in North America and cost associated with our previously announced $3 billion productivity program. Given increased uncertainty and lack of liquidity in Venezuela, we remeasured our bolivar-denominated net monetary assets at the end of the quarter using the SICAD II exchange rate. We are also using the SICAD II exchange rate to translate our Venezuelan subsidiaries local currency income statement into U.S. dollars beginning in January 2015. The receivable write down was recorded as a result of revised assessment of the U.S. dollar value we expect to receive. Despite a difficult operating environment in Venezuela, the Coca-Cola system remains committed to the market and will continue producing and selling our products that Venezuelan consumers enjoy on a daily basis. As you saw on our scorecard, full year free cash flow with $8.2 billion, up 3% primarily due to the efficient management of working capital and cycling incremental pension contributions last year, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the deconsolidation of the Company\u2019s Brazilian bottling operations in July 2013. For the year, cash returned on invested capital declined 32 basis points due to the $1.5 billion investment we made in Keurig Green Mountain. As we look ahead to 2015, we anticipate continued challenging macroeconomic conditions in many markets around the world. Despite this, we're on track with the access we laid out during our last earnings call and we remain confident in the outlook we provided in December. Therefore we expect our comparable currency neutral EPS growth in 2015 to be mid-single digit, roughly in line with our growth rate in 2014. As you\u2019ll recall from the modeling call in December, there are many puts and takes to our P&L in 2015 with the exception of currency these are not changed. Therefore I'm not going into detail on this call, but you can see the various line items on Slide 13. After considering our hedge positions, current spot rate and the cycling of our prior-year rates, we now expect an approximate five-point currency headwind on net revenues with a seven to eight-point headwind on profit before tax for the full year 2015. This is a stronger headwind than the previously communicated five to six-point for profit before tax due primarily to the effect from translating our bolivar-denominated profit at the SICAD II rate and to a recent decline in several emerging market currencies which we do not hedge. In terms of coverage, we're fully hedged on the Euro, Yen and Sterling for 2015. We also have near term coverage in place across several other major currencies. There are a couple of phasing items you should consider when modeling the first quarter. Due to our fiscal calendar, there are six additional days in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to the first quarter of 2014. Although that will benefit revenue, variable cost such as marketing, sales and distribution expenses will also occur to a much greater degree in the first quarter. We expect the Venezuelan pricing provision will continue to negatively impact our net revenue and operating income in the first quarter of 2015 as we began to recognize the impact in the second quarter of last year. And we expect structural items primarily related to North America to be a headwind in the first quarter. Taken together, we expect structural adjustment and the Venezuelan pricing provision to be an approximate two-point headwind on net revenues and an approximate three-point headwind on a profit before tax. In addition, we will cycle the timing of expenses in the first quarter of last year when we had four-points of operating leverage. Therefore we expect the comparable currency neutral operating leverage will be negative in the first quarter. Finally, we currently expect currency will be an approximate six-point headwind on net revenues and an approximate eight-point headwind on profit before tax in the first quarter as we cycle more favorable rates from the prior year. We currently anticipate closing the transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation at the beginning of the second quarter, note that there is a slightly later than our initial expectations of the first quarter due to various closing considerations. At this stage we do not anticipate any material changes to our structural impact guidance from December and of course we will update you along the way if there were to be a change. In closing we're confident in our strategies and in the actions we've already taken to regain our momentum. 2015 will be a transition year as we implement significant change in our company and continue to reinvest in our business. We absolutely believe that the Coca-Cola Company is best positioned to capture growth in the non-alcoholic beverages and to continue to deliver long term value to our shareholders. Operator, we're now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, good morning everyone. I've got a question about -- Muhtar, in your prepared remarks you mentioned the consumer environment remain volatile in terms of your expectations for '15. Can you talk a little bit about sort of what type, what range of volatility you might have embedded in your sort of plan for '15, maybe talk a little bit more specifically about the consumer environment both in Europe and Latin America where those are really two important markets for the company and where it seems volatile and then finally just maybe how that might affect your decision to spend more vagaries in those markets this year given the volatility -- I know there is a lot there but? Thanks.\nMuhtar Kent: Sure. Thanks, Brian. First just at a very high level 10,000 feet, 2015 I think we expect the macro environment to even become a little more volatile versus 2013 and 2014. As the micro economic vagaries get worse in certain parts of the world, so rate of interest, currency certainly will add to volatility, growth gaps will in some parts are going to -- versus other parts are going to grow. Take for example the United States and Great Britain two large western economies starting the year of 2015 strong whereas the Euro zone, Japan and most of the emerging worlds starting the year slower. So there is this kind of gap and some catching up to do.  We're gaining share across the world in Sparkling juices, important categories. The industry -- we see some evidence that there are some things that are working for us but we need to be cautious and take it quarter-by-quarter I think that\u2019s really is important, then as far as Latin America is concerned I think Columbia seems to do continue to do really well as an economy and I think there is some more lifting to do in Mexico and Brazil and South zone. I was recently in Latin America and our business there continues to -- we have fantastic group of bottling partners investing for the short and long-term growth and we continue to gain share, we have a fantastic -- very strong packaged product channel segmentation and architecture and pricing, competitive, but at the same time great revenue growth, management strategies working there.  And so Europe as towards the last quarter, quarter four which we're just reporting on the Southern European countries continue to be challenged. Germany, our business was very much in the positive, Northern Europe had a better environment for us -- was a better environment for us than the South and Eastern Europe is again challenged by some of the macro volatility that spills over across from the East. So I think that how will see.  And then Asia I think we're still very bullish and Africa and you see the actions we have taken related to the reorganizing our bottling structure to even better suit the growth potential and opportunities there in both Indonesia, the fourth most top of the nation in the world as well as the very dynamic one plus billion consumers in Africa. \nBryan Spillane : And just -- fair to say that you\u2019ve got a sort of wider range of volatility or contingencies for that type of volatility built into the 2015 plan to -- maybe they\u2019re normal, just in such a volatile environment?\nMuhtar Kent : Yes and I think when you look at LRP or non-alcoholic ready to drink beverages, Brian I think what you would see probably is maybe a hundred basis points less growth versus the sort of previous years. It's again anybody's guess as to how quickly some of those economies are going to come back. So that we have definitely all those contingencies built in and maybe I can refer to Ahmet to give you a few more sort of snapshots of the world in terms of micro and macro picture. Ahmet?\nAhmet Bozer: Thanks, Muhtar. Brian, the only thing I would add to Muhtar's calculation is that volatility sort of comes on top of sort of slowdown. But what's working for us is that we're getting more and more traction on our plans and programs working with our bottlers. I was in about four, five different countries over the last couple of weeks and even though we witness economic volatility or uncertainty even in Northern Europe, yes there is quantitative easing, yes there is lower oil prices but it is uncertain yet whether the consumer will really benefit from that. But even within that our plans that address the right pricing and packaging and the right level of media investment and our alignment with our bottling system is giving us confidence that we could actually weather this volatility in line with the guidance that has been provided.  So couple of bright spots too, I was in India probably one country where there is a lot of optimism inside the country in terms of economic development. And as you know we have an incredible momentum in India over the last seven or eight years especially last year. And our plans continue to build on each other from year to year, so that's pretty. I was in Brazil, again a similar story. After the elections there was come cautious optimism and that sort of caution side of that continues there is still a bit of optimism. But we do continue to deliver our results despite that environment as you know Brazil had a mid-single digit growth at the end of the quarter. Yes, it was cycling better numbers from last year. But we've also had very strong share gains in Brazil. So I would say that is our story, there is volatility on top of a slowdown but we do have traction with our plans and programs in the marketplace with close alignment with our bottlers.\nMuhtar Kent : Bryan one last thing I want to add to what Ahmet said and what I had said earlier to your question about doesn\u2019t make sense to invest in media and marketing. And the answer is absolutely yes, when we are able to target our investments in media and the way we're doing it, segmenting them by the different countries and the different regions of the world and improving not just the quantity but also the quality of the media that\u2019s what one of the main important factors that we see driving a better revenue number -- a better price mix number. So the two are really connected and that\u2019s what I really want to -- so gain in share improving on the top line through all the actions we're taking of which targeted media increased an improved quality media is one of those.\nBryan Spillane: Alright thank you for that look forward seeing you next down at Cagney.\nOperator: Our next question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.\nJudy Hong : So I guess my question is really relating to the strong price mix that you saw in North America in the quarter. Obviously you've been focused on getting mix impact and rational pricing can you just speak to how much of the improvement was mix driven as opposed to maybe cycling some of the height and promotional environment last year. And as you think about 2015 and beyond just thinking about some of the mix acceleration potential on the pricing spot in North America.\nMuhtar Kent : I'll let Irial answer that question and then also Sandy will add labor to that too.\nIrial Finan: I think the most important things are 12 quarters ago Sandy and I spoke on this topic and we iterated our belief in having balanced price mix volume growth in North America. And we delivered another epic quarter this year and our plan is to deliver again next year in the same way. But in terms of your question on mix and headline price it's a balanced approach. Yes in the fourth quarter last year we were trending some lower numbers when we had some heavy promotional activity, but when you look over the half year as Muhtar said we grew pricing 4%. So we feel very good about the actions we\u2019re taking, we're feeling very good about how the trade is reacting and more importantly we're feeling very good that our marketing and our execution are coming together in a way that really adds incremental value to our system. But I'll ask Sandy to add to that.\nSandy Douglas: As Irial said it's a consistent strategy and the strategy is born of where the consumer wanted to go. The consumer is buying smaller special packages of our Sparkling beverage brand and accelerating that purchase and we're seeing the kind of mix benefit from that that you described. But that\u2019s coupled with the disciplined approach to rate and volume. Because in the end what we're trying to do is expand the values and usefulness of our brand and create value for our customers and through the consistent execution of that strategy we're seeing in 2014 solid year, but a year of improving performance through the year and we'll continue to pursue that disciplined strategy in 2015. \nJudy Hong : Got it okay and Kathy if can just have a quick follow up on just in terms of the commodities in 2015, what have you locked in, in terms of your exposure there. And as you think about different commodity complexes that are turning more favorable. How much of that could we expect to see drive some of that margin improvement, particularly markets like North America?\nKathy Waller: The commodities environment for 2015, commodities we expect really to be benign for -- there are some that are absolutely favorable. But then we have other challenges and depending on the amount in North America, but of that in North America we also have impact of secondary exchange embedded into our commodity. So we really anticipated being more of a benign commodity environment for us versus they have any significant impact or benefits from it.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Faucher from JPMC.\nJohn Faucher: Wanted to follow a little bit on Muhtar on your comment on Europe and obviously it's been a difficult market over the past couple of years. What's the right way to think about sort of glide pass getting back to growth there? Is it something where QE works and we start to see the economy come back, you think you can get back to consistent growth and what are some realistic sort of ranges of expectations for 2015 and potentially into 2016? Thanks.\nMuhtar Kent: Yes well I think we're all going to watch what's happening with the quantities easing, John, in Europe 18 months of the planned amount 60 billion and month of Euros coming kicking in whether that will have an impact or not we will watch and see. I think stability is the key word for Europe as we go into 2015. So, not getting much worst and I think in some areas continued volatility and South Europe is going to continue to be, certainly to be a challenge. So, I don't think there is going to be suddenly a lifting of the cloud for the consumers in the Southern belt of Europe, I think Germany is the very low, -- current exchange rate I think will help exporting countries for sure, how soon will that trickle in related to Germany, related to other export markets from Europe. But that's a positive; the quantitative easing is a positive.  The notion that most consumers now are used to this environment and feel that it's not going to get much worse, it may get a little better because of the [indiscernible], so we\u2019ll have to see but we think that it will continue to be challenged and then you've got of course the whole political environment to sort of basically weave into the equation, that political environment is something that is an unknown for us all. I think that's how I would see, as far as growth, yes, there will be pockets of growth in Europe and there will be continued pockets of challenges but I think what we see was our -- we've very strong plans in place with our bottling partners for growth in Europe and we'll see how -- we've all kinds of contingencies built into the plan in Europe also and we're going to take it quarter-by-quarter.\nJohn Faucher: Great, thanks and if I can ask one follow up to Kathy. Kathy, you talked about your FX coverage on translational for '15, obviously what this can lead to sometime is sort of year two impact, any thoughts on 2016 and how you\u2019ll manage what could potentially be some FX headwind there as the hedges roll-off? Thanks.\nKathy Waller: Yes, so John, for 2016 we are also hedged on our major currencies and at this point also have some on other currencies as well. So, we'll manage the impact and we're at pretty good rates at this point with that hedging. So, basically we don't think that there is a relative issue at this point.\nOperator: Thank you, our next question is from Steve Powers from UBS.\nSteve Powers : Hey, thanks, good morning. I guess one quicker clarification question and a slightly more thematic one. First, obviously there are lot of moving parts driving pricing mix in the quarter globally, and I was wondering if you could just focus in on rate increases and talk about trend there because my guess is that rate lagged overall price mix in North America which you talked about but Europe, the volume [best] looks like in Latin America and then rate was probably stronger than price mix and Eurasia, Africa, Pacific and across the whole company, so any help there would be great just parsing our overall rate trend. And then more broadly, it sounds like your productivity targets remain unchanged from last fall, which isn't really surprising as it's only been a few months, but at the same time we've already seen announcements of headcount reductions that likely we're not envisioned prior to your October update. So I\u2019m wondering, why we're not seeing more incrementality sooner on that front or perhaps we are, it\u2019s just being absorbed by the macro headwinds, so if you can clarify that, that would be great.\nMuhtar Kent: Steve, this is Muhtar, good morning again. As far as the rate versus mix I think it's basically completely depended on the country and the environment and the region. So there is no trend globally, this is on average, this much rate and this much -- it all depends on price tag channel architecture, our position in the market, the strength of our brand, how effective is our marketing driving the result that we need, which is all work in progress. So, I think it all depends on -- and I'll let Sandy comment on the United States, on that but it's very much dependent on the region and depended on the country and depended on the circumstances. I think that's really what I would say and then Sandy, you want to just address the United States part of that question?\nSandy Douglas: Sure, I mean our strategy in the U.S. is again as Irial sad very consistent. We view there to be a significant upside pricing opportunity in the Sparkling beverage category. We are driving that with significant investments in brand building and execution of price package architecture that will expand margins for our system and also for our customers and that involves a very healthy rate program but at the same time, we're executing with tremendous amount of energy, multiple proprietary and other small packages that the consumer is buying at accelerating rates, I mean for example mini Cans increased by 15% in the fourth quarter and that's following the consumer to smaller packaged sizes of the brands they love and that combination of rate and mix is creating a good balance with volume to healthy top-line growth picture. \nMuhtar Kent: And see just on your question on why -- what on productivity, I would say to you that they reorg and how we're flattening the organization and the number of -- and announced cuts were all part of the program -- totally part of the program. So there is nothing that just being executed and that's all. And as Kathy -- we standby what Kathy said in the modeling call in December we're on track with the 500 plus million dollars piece of the productivity program for 2015 and we're on track with that. So but just to emphasize all of what you see, what you hear, what you read was part of the program. \nSteve Powers : Okay. So just two points of clarification just a follow-up on those answers, thank you very much. On the price mix I guess maybe just Kathy -- specifically to Eurasia, Africa where I am assuming great pricing in Russia for example is quite positive should we be expecting this negative mix trend to persist in '15, this is one pop on pricing. And then Muhtar to your point on the part of the plan, does that mean the headcount reductions for example that were announced, was that part of the original $1 billion or is that part of the additional $2 billion that was announced last call? Thanks. \nMuhtar Kent: Just quickly on the last piece of your question, it was part of the additional 2 billion and then as far as the rate increases I will defer it to Ahmet, if you want to just refer to that part of the question. \nAhmet Bozer: On the markets like EAG we price in line with inflation, we may be slightly below inflation, slightly ahead at times, so you should expect to see consistent rate increase more or less in that range. Fourth quarter for EAG was a bit of an anomaly, there was a sort of geographic mix impact that was driven by cycling of Galland shipment. So if you look at full year price mix realization of EAG, it\u2019s a healthy 4 points. So I wouldn't look at Q4 to draw any conclusion. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. \nAli Dibadj: So, given the pressure that currency is placing and kind of all this macro volatility. Do you anticipate or can you actually accelerate anything around your cost cutting plans to offset this or do you plan taking even more pricing in places like Europe, Eurasia, Africa, or Asia-Pacific where does it not look like you are offsetting your currency moves as much?\nMuhtar Kent: Yes I think Ali it\u2019s just on a broad base answer to your question. I think it's really critical that we balance the needs in the marketplace and the needs for us to be healthy in the marketplace on a both medium and long-term basis that's why we hold accountable all our business unit President's for local currency. And I think that, we're very happy with our progress so far with what we're doing with our productivity initiatives and what the current results are for those productivity initiatives so far, early days. But we certainly are looking to do more where it makes sense. But one thing you will not see us is taking -- basically actions in the marketplace that weakens our position for the medium and long-term that's the critical piece that I want to stress. \nAli Dibadj: So in other words we shouldn\u2019t anticipate more pricing as FX continues to be at a negative pressure. And if you can answer that also in the context of the benign mix of commodities in 2015 and if that's a limit on your ability to take pricing again to offset FX in the bottle price  context?\nMuhtar Kent:  I think we work with all the different levers that are available to us. How our better marketing --more marketing is working driving results, how the investments are working, with that we're putting in the marketplace with our bottling partners, our basic brand strength in the marketplace all of those things. And especially in terms of commodities, again that's something that is very volatile in the world that we live in. Four or five months ago if someone said we\u2019d be looking at the current price of oil, no one would have believed this. So I think everything is changing very rapidly and we are remaining flexible on what we can achieve to the best of our ability, both in pricing, both in terms of investing for the future as well as making sure that our investments are targeted and our segmentation works. So I think there is not one solution, the segmentation is really driving better results than we have anticipated when we put that program into place. \nAli Dibadj: Okay. So I am just trying to understand, so we could anticipate if the consumer is ready to do it and if the segmentation suggest, we could see more pricing align with inflation because of currencies being so negative. Is that kind of what you\u2019re saying? \nMuhtar Kent: Ali I'll just leave to what I said.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel Financials.\nMark Swartzberg: Just a quick one Kathy a technical question, the six additional days in the first quarter, is there some level to get back later in the year. Do we see reverse of that in the fourth quarter for example?\nKathy Waller: Based on our corporate calendar the six additional days get pushed into the first quarter. But they come out in the fourth quarter.\nMark Swartzberg: Okay fair enough. That\u2019s all I've got. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question is from Bill Schmidt from Deutsche Bank.\nBill Schmidt: Wanted to ask sort of a housekeeping question. Can you just tell us what the pricing would have been in Latin America if you were at SICAD II for this year and last?\nMuhtar Kent: I think what we talked about is oil pricing in terms of the local currency we pick. So whether we re-measured that in SICAD I or II it will be the same number.\nBill Schmidt: Okay I was just trying to get at what impact Venezuela had on the price, it\u2019s just for modeling for next year I think there was sort of Venezuela anomaly this quarter that might have taken that pricing down next year.\nKathy Waller: So for next year the impact of share pricing law will continue in Venezuela. That is what actually impacts our revenue in Venezuela, so its caps our ability to take revenue that does continue obviously it's kind of cost -- that are over in 2015. But it will not be a structural item because we [indiscernible] as of the second quarter. But then -- yes we also do have an impact to our revenues from a different exchange rate and that will be considered into currency.\nBill Schmidt: And then just on Asia Pacific we came in a little bit late then our expectations. And I think it's one of the lowest volumes outcomes in while and in you prepared comments it seems like you're fairly safe about that segment. So was there an anomaly this quarter that took the volume a little bit softer and the price mix of negative and other is a mix element there. But any comments on that would be very much appreciate.\nAhmet Bozer: Hey Bill, this is Ahmet. I'll try and address that; one big thing was the timing of the Chinese New Year. But I wouldn\u2019t conclude my comments without saying that the market in China specially the food and beverage market has been weakest in the last 10 years. But I would also say that we've been consistently applying our strategy that we have covered with you guys number of times before. And resulting in fairly significant share gains in China and as you know in Japan and in the middle of last year there was increase in taxes and we're continuing to see the effect of that. But still delivering almost close to flat but not that close it\u2019s minus one. So -- but the biggest item there was the timing of the Chinese New Year as well as continued sort of industry headwinds in China.\nBill Schmidt: And just one quick last one if I could. Just too kind of gauge the progress of the productivity program is it good metric to look at the cooperate and allocated line in the segment data. So should that come down as kind of the restructuring savings come through? \nKathy Waller: The cooperate on allocated line. So yes that is one place where you will be able to see the restructuring come through, but as Muhtar said we are on track with everything that we have announced to date.\nOperator: Now I would like to turn the call back to Muhtar Kent for closing remark.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you Kathy, Ahmet, Sandy and Tim. In summary, we\u2019re moving quickly to regionalize revenue growth while simultaneously driving cost out of our business during an aggressive productivity plan. While we've already made progress against our five strategic actions to regain our momentum we're just beginning 2015 will be a transition year as we rewire our operating model for growth and mix in uncertain global consumer environment. While the macroeconomic environment remains challenging in the near term we are confident in our ability to return to sustainable growth as the long term dynamics of our industry remain promising. Our brands and our global system are unparalleled and we are fully dedicated to strengthening our position as the world's leading beverage company. As always we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning. \nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Today I am going to start with an overview of our quarterly performance and then spend the rest of the time addressing the strategic initiatives we announced earlier this morning in our set of release. So let\u2019s look at our performance for the third quarter. Our overall topline results for the third quarter were below our expectations. Comparable currency neutral net revenues grew 1% in the quarter and after adjusting for structural items due to factors both within and outside of our control. We continue to face a challenging macro environment; more challenging than was expected when we started the year. In many of our key emerging markets we see deteriorating economic environments coupled with continued softness in consumer spending in the U.S. and particularly in Japan and Europe. This is placing strong pressure on the short term performance of our business. These factors have driven a deceleration in personal consumption expenditures and as a result the non-alcoholic beverage industry is growing one to two points slower than our initial forecast at the beginning of the year. With that said, there is no question that we need to improve our execution in many markets especially our consumer marketing and commercial strategies. Although we could point to various markets, this was most prominent in Europe where we saw continued challenging macroeconomic environment and also aggressive competitive pricing. We achieved a 3% price mix in Europe which was partially offset by a volume decline of 5%. While we are not comfortable with our year-to-date share performance in Europe, we along with our bottling partners know we must light better consumer and commercial strategies and execution that can benefit from incremental investment in the market place and we\u2019re taking actions to address this situation. That said, we are not discouraged nor are we any less enthusiastic about the opportunities in front of us. In markets where we executed our strategies well we saw solid progress in North America our disciplined approach to pricing supported by incremental media investments, high quality marketing programs such as Share a Coke and disciplined price pack strategies as well as improved execution is paying dividends with increased incidence particularly among teams and revenue growth in our Sparkling portfolio. In key emerging markets including India, Sub-Sahara Africa as well as the Middle East are incremental media investments drove recruitment with solid net revenue and volume growth. This gives us confidence that when we invest in our brands, align on our system plan and focus on execution we do see positive results. But to be clear, we recognize that our incremental media investments which already started in earnest around the FIFA World Cup will take time to pay off. Stepping back from our quarterly performance, we\u2019ve taken a hard look at our progress to date. Our strategies and our actions and realize that while the five strategic priorities we laid out at the beginning of the year are on the right track we recognize that we must do more. Above all, the scope and pace of our actions must change to improve our ability to capture non-alcoholic beverage industry growth. And that change starts with me. I\u2019ve asked my leadership team to take this journey with me and to facilitate this change throughout our company. It\u2019s a journey we are ready to embark upon. In some ways, we\u2019ve already enhanced our business with strategic investments in Keurig Green Mountain and intend to further do so with our pending investment in master beverages which underscore not only our ability to adapt the changing consumer trends but also our commitment to further innovation. But these partnerships alone are not enough that is why we are laying out today a series of actions we firmly believe will drive the necessary changes to continue to deliver long term shareholder value. First, we are streamlining and simplifying our operating model in order to speed decision making and enhance our local markets focus to drive growth. This work is moving forward aggressively and we expect to focus the role for our corporate center and further scale our back office to support processes and policies globally. This will also enable our local operations to focus intently on demand creation in their individual markets. And as previously announced, we are revising our long term incentive metrics to provide a clear line of sight between our employees around the globe and the metrics they can best influence. Second, we will drive efficiency through aggressively expanding our productivity program. We plan to expand the program from 1 billion in savings by 2016 to 2 billion in annualized savings by 2017 and 3 billion by 2019. This productivity program will build on previous successful programs encompassing our entire spend base and will supplant our existing plan announced earlier this year. A number of actions are already taking place. We are restructuring our global supply chain including optimizing our manufacturing footprint in North America and investing in technology to streamline \u2013 to further streamline our operations. We are implementing zero based budgeting across our organization and are dreadfully prioritizing and redesigning our normal activities to further reduce costs. As I have previously mentioned we are streamlining and simplifying our operating model which will enhance our speed and agility and result in lower operating expenses overtime. Finally we are working to drive even more disciplined and efficiency in our direct marketing investments. As a result of these initiatives we plan to fund the marketing programs and innovation required to reinvigorate and deliver sustainable net revenue growth. At the same time, we expect these actions will drive margin expansion and increase return on investment capital overtime. Our third action is to refocus on our core business model of building the world\u2019s greatest beverage brands and leading an unmatched global system of strong local bottling partners. In North America, we have a clear and definitive plan to refranchise the majority of our company owned bottling territories by the end of 2017, so at that time we will retain approximately one third of the total bottling distributed volume in North America. With respect to the remaining territories our intent is to ensure the bulk of these are refranchised at the latest by 2020. Finally outside of North America we will continue to pursue opportunities to refranchise other company owned bottlers where it makes sense, where the business is ready and where we have able and willing partners. Fourth, we will drive disciplined brand and growth investments with a long term view across both Sparkling and Still categories. We will take a balanced approach to ensure we can build our business while consistently delivering bottom line results. In Sparkling as outlined earlier this year, we will continue to work to improve the quality of our marketing and scale our global investments through a network marketing model to improve topline growth across trademark Coca Cola, Fanta and Sprite. During the second quarter of this year we began to step up our media investments. Our investments target markets and categories where our current media is underfunded relative to the market opportunity we see as well as where we have the right price package architecture and finally off course execution alignment with our partners. In Still beverages we will continue to invest in our core growth priorities where we are a leader and notably juice and juice drinks and enhance the hydration. We will expand our investments in selected profitable categories where we believe we can capture value such as value-added dairy. And we will continue to leverage our partnership model with companies such as Keurig Green Mountain, Monster and FairLife as well as targeted M&A to enhance our growth in key categories. We expect these efforts to build on our global leadership in Still beverages and accelerate growth overtime. This we will drive revenue and profit growth across our markets with a further focus on geographic segmentation recognizing that each market has an important role to play within our portfolio. We\u2019ve targeted our markets with clear role is to drive topline growth with some markets focused on price, others on volume and the remainder on the balance of the two. Beginning 2015, our incentive metrics will be expanded to include revenue growth and will be tied to these clear portfolio roles. We are confident that the action we are announcing today will ensure that the Coca Cola Company is best positioned to capture growth in non-alcoholic beverages and continues to deliver long term value to our shareholders. Since its inception our 2020 vision has served to focus our system on the opportunity and to align on our common set of strategies. We have begun the process of evolving our 2020 vision with our bottlers earlier this year, a process that will continue over the coming months. Together, we remain confident in the growth potential for non-alcoholic beverages. While growth rates will be challenging in the short term given the macroeconomic volatility, we believe that overtime consumer trends will support mid-single digit revenue growth. Importantly, the core Sparkling category remains resilient and has growth retail value globally for the first nine months of the year 3% outpacing the non-alcoholic ready to drink industries total value growth of 2%. And we also see effective profitable growth opportunities in still beverages, ones that we are well positioned to take advantage of but ones that requires faster action and greater and focused investments. While we have more work to do here, it is clear that our 2020 vision will remain focused on delivering value growth for our \u2013 ahead of the industry. Importantly, the goal of doubling system revenues one our system can always aspire towards it, but it is not a goal to be pursued at any cost over a fixed time frame and we are realigning our expectations based on where we are today and the outlook for our industry. Let me be clear, we see no change to our long term target of high single digit comparable currency neutral EPS growth. We are updating our net revenue target to mid-single digit growth in order to perfect current reality including the increased contribution from our new partnership model which will impact equity income rather than slowing through net revenues and operating income. And we are evolving our primary profit metric from operating income through profit before tax. Going forward, the profit before tax this will be 6% to 8% on the comparable currency neutral basis consistent with the previous operating income target of 6% to 8%. With that said, we must also be realistic. While we are very confident in our actions we are cautious in our outlook. The actions announced to date and the additional work we had to do will take time to implement and deliver improvement in our results. As such, we expect to be below our long term EPS growth target for 2014 on a full year basis. We will come back to you with more contexts in December; however we see 2015 as a critical year, a year in transition as we flawlessly implement our new operating model amidst the continued challenging macroeconomic environment. I am confident however that we have the brands, the greatest and most wide reaching consumer product distribution system in the world, the critical partnerships and most importantly the people to return us to a more robust growth trajectory. I\u2019ll now hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Waller, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our financial performance as well as an outlook on our business for the balance of the year. Following Kathy's prepared remarks, Irial Finan, Sandy Douglas, Ahmet Bozer, Kathy and I will participate in our question and answer session to address any questions that you may have today. Kathy?\nKathy Waller: Thank you Muhtar, and good morning everyone. In recognition of our time, I plan to cover key highlights from the quarter and outlook, and then we can move to your questions. Let\u2019s start by reviewing the few key drivers of our financial performance. After adjusting for unit cases without concentrated sales equivalent, concentrated sales were in line with unit case sales for both the quarter and year-to-date. Comparable currency neutral net revenue growth was 1% in the quarter and 2% year-to-date after excluding the impact of structural items. Our topline growth slowed from the first half of the year due primarily to a volume deceleration principally in Europe and China. Price mix was positive across each of our geographies with the exception of Asia Pacific due to geographic mix, however due to the composition of growth we saw a negative geographic mix at the consolidated level resulting in 1% global price mix for both the quarter and year-to-date. Comparable currency neutral growth profit was up 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date after excluding the impact of structural items. Our gross margin expanded in the quarter due to pricing, favorable geographic and product mix and a slight tailwind from commodity cost. We generated one point of operating leverage in the quarter as continued investments behind our brand to accelerate growth including a mid-single digit increase in DME, were offset by tight control over operating expenses and the reversal of certain expenses related to our long term incentive plan. Comparable currency neutral operating income was up 5% in both the quarter and year-to-date after excluding the impact of structural items. The impact of currency was a three point headwind on this quarters comparable operating income results. Comparable ECS was even in the third quarter including a currency headwind of six points. Although the currency headwind and operating income was in line with the outlook we provided last quarter, foreign currency unfavorably impacted EPS by six points due to additional currency headwinds related to the measurement gains and losses recorded in the line item other income. We generated $8 billion in cash from operations year-to-date and returned $1.9 billion to share on us through net share repurchases. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter of 2014, let me take a minute to update you on a few outlook items as we model our business. We do not expect the current trajectory for unit case volume growth to improve materially for the remainder of the year. We expect structural items to be a one to two-point drag on net revenue growth, and approximate two-point drag on operating income growth in the fourth quarter of 2014. After considering our hedge positions, current spot rates, and cycling of our prior-year rates, we now expect a seven-point currency headwind on operating income during the fourth quarter of 2014, with a six-point impact on operating income for the full year 2014 We expect net interest income to be approximately $100 million for the full year 2014. We now expect approximately $2.5 billion in net share repurchases for the year. And we now expect our full year comparable currency neutral EPS growth to be below our long term target. As we look ahead to 2015, we anticipate continued challenging macroeconomic conditions in most developed markets as well as some key emerging markets. The best way to think about 2015 is as a year of transition. We will start implementing changes to create our new operating model in the beginning of 2015, but incremental marketing investments and margin enhancements will pay time to fully materialize. Therefore based on what we see today with our continuing need to invest in our business and recognizing that we are early in our planning process. We do not expect our comparable currency neutral, financial performance in 2015 to differ significantly from this year. As we move through our planning process we look forward to providing more detail and a methodology to benchmark our progress through 2015 and beyond. As such we plan to host the modeling call in December to discuss our 2015 outlook, including further details of the impacts from our refranchising efforts in North America. However, given the amount of questions around currency for next year, we did want to provide an initial estimate of the impact at the PBT line to better help you model into next year. We currently expect a mid single-digit currency headwind on profit before tax in 2015. We will come back with more contexts on the December call. As Muhtar said, we are committed to taking the right actions to reinvigorate our top-line growth over time. We have a strong plan in place and we are aligned as a team to deliver against our objectives. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning.\nMuhtar Kent: Good morning.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: There\u2019s lot of questions that could be asked. But I guess one that I just wanted to focus in on is the change in target from focusing on operating profit growth to pretax income. And I guess, it\u2019s sort of suggest that there is contribution that will come from growth and equity income. Can you just give us some sort of gauge in terms, how much of the growth you actually expect to come from equity income? How much comes from operating profit? Just trying to get an idea of the proportions and whether or not there\u2019s actually a suggestion that operating profit would grow slower than that in that goal?\nMuhtar Kent: Bryan, good morning again, this is Muhtar. I think the most important is that our EPS target remains high single digits and our target for profit before tax is still 6% to 8%. And beginning in 2015 revenue growth will be added as a metric in the Company\u2019s incentive plan as well. So, we\u2019re obviously looking at a metric that really where the target remains 6% to 8%. And moving the target to PBT really brings net interest and equity income into consideration. And if you look back at the last three years they really has not been leverage between OI and BPT meaningfully. So it would not have really made a difference. Having said that, it does go back to what we said about broadening our long-term net revenue target to mid single-digit. And we think that there is opportunity to grow equity income as we advance our existing partnerships as well as explore similar models in the future. And using PBT instead of OI should make operations in the way agnostic in terms of evaluating alternatives to extract value in a certain given category, for example, what you mentioned also which is partnership model versus concentrate model. So I think it\u2019s a better broadening \u2013 broaden way of ensuring that we can deliver long-term sustainable value to our shareholders. And I\u2019ll pass it on to Kathy if she wants to add anything.\nKathy Waller: Yes. I\u2019ll just also say, Bryan remember we anticipate and we\u2019ve been saying that with increases in interest rates we will have interest expense versus interest income as we\u2019ve been generating. So, we don\u2019t anticipate interest providing leverage below the line going forward. So, the bottom line we can\u2019t make the 6 to 8 BPT without a significant amount coming from operating income.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. So, no suggestions, that there is a material change in operating income growth that you just trying to collect the other pieces below that?\nKathy Waller: No, not at all.\nMuhtar Kent: No suggestions in any respect.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Ian Shackleton from Nomura.\nIan Shackleton - Nomura.: Yes. Good morning. And previously you\u2019d indicated on the $1 billion product to the savings that will be all reinvested in media. Perhaps you can give us some idea of how much of the $3 billion will be reinvested and also a savings of that will be through to 2019, it strikes me that U.S. production change, is that\u2019s going to be quite backend loaded in that timeframe?\nMuhtar Kent: Hi, and this is Muhtar. Good morning. Firstly, let me just give you some context around the base. If you take -- firstly that\u2019s why we put two numbers out $2 billion by 2017 and $3 billion by 2019 in order to show that everyone sees that this is not backend loaded, its just a number that really will be generated and the run rate will be flowing through into our system and then we will invest some and use some for margin enhancement. We did say that it will take some time to achieve, 2015 is the critical year where we really is the most important year for us to make the changes that I mentioned to you in terms of a leaner, better operating model and therefore I think it\u2019s \u2013 that year should be seen as a year in transition. The base really when you look at our company, you see about $5.5 billion in total in marketing about $4 billion OpEx, and really of the $3 billion about $1.5 billion will come out that base of around $9.5 billion to $10 billion and then other $1.5 billion will be of the $3 billion will come out at about $25 billion COGS base. And it\u2019s important to understand for everyone that we will not be taking down the second number $1.5 billion when we refranchise with our aggressive refranchising program particularly for the United States between now and 2017. So, that number will stay that way and then the bottlers will get additional opportunities for COGS synergy as the territories get refranchised on top of the $3 billon. So, I hope that gives you some flavor and explanation into and answers to some your questions. And Kathy, go ahead.\nKathy Waller: So Ian, if I could just add that on the initial $1 billion program, $400 million was in 2014 and we are on track. So that continues into 2015 with the rest of the productivity giving us the flexibility to achieve our target over the long-term.\nIan Shackleton - Nomura.: And just come on 2015 guide, it obviously look quite bearish versus where the street is you seem to be highlighting there\u2019s been quite a lot extra costs there without savings. Is it also a comment that you\u2019re quite cautious around revenue growth i.e. you seem to be applying it will be more in line with 2014, which is more like 2% not a 3% plus? Is that right?\nMuhtar Kent: Yes. I think given the sort of macroeconomic volatility out there and given the fact that marketing investments are taking some time to flow back in terms of benefit. I just say, that\u2019s the best we see right now and we will come back with a more robust and more detail discussion on 2015 in our December call.\nIan Shackleton - Nomura.: Okay. Thanks very much\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.\nAli Dibadj - Bernstein: Hi, guys. So I think we\u2019re generally pleased that there\u2019s more urgency around price mix and in North American franchise mix and the cost cutting. But I do want to understand a little bit better how much of the cost cutting you think you\u2019re going to need to reinvest? And really why you think you have to reinvest? And I say that because look you\u2019re going to reinvest and I want to hear what, but you\u2019re going to get back to your previous growth rates. But this whole time a lot of discussion is about blaming mostly short term macro issues. So is there something that\u2019s underlying [indiscernible] [EG] perhaps consumer transferred health and wellness or something. And in fact is it a good ROI to invest in the business in marketing versus taking some to the bottom-line and to shareholders who have been rather disappointed recently? So any help there would be great?\nMuhtar Kent: Yes. I think we\u2019re talking about is a balance approach bring us back to our long-term growth trajectory in terms of our financial performance. That is a combination of both growth more realistic and better sustainable growth on the top-line as well as margin enhancements. So as we said before, this additional program of productivity will yield, will generate two things, we believe clearly better growth as well as better margin enhancement. And the important thing here is that we will have a much better segmented geographic segmented analysis of countries where if you take the developed countries, we will be driving profitable growth through innovation and productivity, for example, with top countries like Spain, Korea, Great Britain, Japan, U.S., France and so forth. And then, in terms of the developing countries they will have a different, slightly different role maximizing value through segmentation and ensuring that continue to build consumer loyalty markets like Latin America, Turkey, Poland, Nigeria and an emerging markets like China, India, Indonesia, Thailand and so forth will be maximizing more skewed on the volume side and investing for accelerated growth. That is why we need -- we believe we need to continue to invest. And the world is a very big place. It\u2019s not just the countries that we live in and we know. It\u2019s a very wide place out there and there is significant opportunities to continue to generate growth, while at the same time, and we believe that there is a very good line of sight of how we invest and how we get return from that investment, very disciplined and very important transparent line of sight. And that\u2019s the way we look at the segmentation approach and therefore revenue which is the target of what we\u2019ve indicated to you will be a composition of volume and price and so we\u2019ve not throwing volume out of the door. We\u2019re not \u2013 it\u2019s a balanced, very balanced approach towards how we will generate revenue, how that revenue will flow into bottom-line both through the additional revenue growth achieved as well as through enhancements in terms of the margin.\nAli Dibadj - Bernstein: So that\u2019s very helpful. And in terms of the clear line of sight can you give us a sense this $3 billion is it half reinvested, half to the bottom-line, is it 60/40. Can you give us a better sense of the split of reinvestment versus bringing it back to the bottom-line?\nMuhtar Kent: Yes. I think we\u2019re not ready to share that detail with your right now. However I think as we go along we\u2019ll give you more insights. But certainly it will not all be invested and it will not all flow into the bottom line, but I think we see a clear balance there as we go forward. And I think there\u2019s different role for the -- obviously there\u2019s a different role for the \u2013 of how you should think about $1.5 billion that is coming out of the base of total marketing and OpEx and also the $1.5 billion that is coming out of the COGS. And I think both of them had slightly different roles in how they will be played out.\nAli Dibadj - Bernstein: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley: Good morning. Muhtar I want to delve a bit more into the changes in price mix versus volume focus and the incentive plans. I\u2019m assuming the enhance pricing focus is more of a developed market phenomenon, but maybe you can review for us how much of the change in focus going forward is in developed market versus emerging market versus how you managed previously? And then in North America has this enhanced pricing focus already played out to some extent, given you\u2019ve already had compensation changes there or should we expect North America to be part of that change in focus going forward also?\nMuhtar Kent: I think the whole company, you should think of entire company as evolving and changing, but as I said, I think the important thing is roles and responsibilities on a geographic basis with complete clarity of roles. So if you take markets like the more developed markets of Korea and Spain and Great Britain and so forth, Japan and United States, Canada, more focus on the balance of revenue, what will drive the revenue, slightly skewed in favor of price versus volume. What will happen in the developing markets more like Latin America and some Eastern European markets and so forth, Turkey, much more straight line right in the middle balance of how that revenue number is going to be generated, that revenue growth target is going to be generated. And then you take the lower per capita more emerging markets that I mentioned, the Indonesia\u2019s and India\u2019s and China\u2019s of this world and Southeast Asia skewed more towards volume. But that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not a pricing metric and that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no incentives based on revenue, it just how they are skewed.\nDara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then while we\u2019re on the subject of pricing, can you characterize the pricing environment right now in North America obviously the 3% sparkling number in the quarter was more favorable than you\u2019ve seen recently. So I wanted to get an update there and how sustainable that performance could be going forward?\nMuhtar Kent: Yes. I\u2019ll ask Sandy to comment on that North America number. Sandy and Irial are here and I\u2019ll ask Sandy to first comment on that.\nSandy Douglas: Yes, Dara, our view of the pricing strategy in the U.S. has been very consistent with what we said at the beginning of the year. Very focused on making sure that we get our price that we balanced that with the package strategy that\u2019s focused on our premium packs and our smaller pack which consumer\u2019s want and continue to grow double-digit. And we\u2019re pleased that you can see in the Nielsen data and the marketplace that consumer is responding with accelerating sales growth, actually volume was slightly better than we expected and clearly the volume on the premium packs that are the focus of our brand building agenda and supported by our advertising are driving the train. So, we\u2019re just at the beginning though. I think North America\u2019s ability to play a primary revenue growth role in the company with this discipline balance strategy is in their early stages and we see a rational environment and we see a good competitive environment in which the category sales performance is accelerating and we\u2019re optimistic about the future.\nMuhtar Kent: Irial, do you want to add to that.\nIrial Finan: Yes. I just remind all of us in the first quarter we said we\u2019ll going to have a very disciplined approach to pricing in North America and the last three quarters we\u2019ve demonstrated that and intension is to keep doing this. And we feel good about it. We feel we\u2019re going in the right direction and feel very confident as we actually heading to the future on pricing in North America.\nMuhtar Kent: And maybe I\u2019ll ask Ahmet to also comment on some of the \u2013 on the same subject as it pertains to Europe and as it pertains to Latin America and some other markets, Ahmet?\nAhmet Bozer: Thanks, Muhtar. As we talked about the revenue focus we are also focusing on balanced revenue growth in Coke International, maybe couple of examples I could share is in Mexico for example, where you see 2% growth in volumes for the quarter and more or less flat volumes. We\u2019re actually seeing fairly healthy price mix of about low to mid single-digits and our revenue growth reflects that as well. Likewise in Brazil, we\u2019re also seeing mid single-digit revenue growth even though our volumes are up only 1%. So, we are quite cognizant of balancing our revenue growth with approximate pricing realization and volume at the same time.\nMuhtar Kent: And you want to say anything about Europe.\nAhmet Bozer: And Europe, obviously we are not pleased with our volume performance of negative 5%, but the challenging macros are bringing with it a fairly aggressive pricing environment in the marketplace and we are always trying to balance our pricing with volume, and in this quarter I would say that we were a lot more in favor of pricing where we have realized three points of price mix in Europe, which resulted in a revenue decline of 2%, while our volumes were five. Having said that, this is a journey in an ongoing balancing act, we would be focusing on balancing that a little better, so that our share performance continues to be strong, which it has been for the last four years and we are on that journey in Europe.\nDara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Schmidt from Deutsche Bank.\nBill Schmidt - Deutsche Bank: Hi, good morning.\nMuhtar Kent: Good morning.\nBill Schmidt - Deutsche Bank: Can you just comment on how much you know relative to the environment what\u2019s secular and cyclical? And then, how your strategy change if it\u2019s more secular and cyclical in terms of some of the consumption trends. And then maybe obviously Muhtar you\u2019ve considerable experience here, is there been a period where you\u2019ve seen things as difficult as they are now and kind of what it took to pull yourselves out of it?\nMuhtar Kent: Yes. I think, Bill, firstly it\u2019s fair to say that we are in a challenged disposable income growth environment, that\u2019s no question. The consumer is challenged everywhere around the world. Its not related to Western developed markets of Europe and Japan, United States and Canada, but it\u2019s also related to emerging markets. There\u2019s a lot of volatility in the world when you look at in the currencies, when you look at interest rates, when you look at the growth rates and when you actually factor in all the different geopolitical issues around the world. There just is a lot of apprehension. Less people traveling from because of disease, because of scares, because of other thing, mobility is down, and traffic is down and that all impacts particularly our immediate consumption business. And so, we\u2019ve got to find a newer better ways to ensure that we can meet our products, our brands, our 3,000 products, 550 brands can meet up with consumers on different occasions, on better occasions, on newer occasion and on more innovative ways to get our products in front of our consumers. And certainly we recognize that is a challenging environment and we operate in that environment, but we have a still one of the most dynamic consumer goods businesses in the world, and we believe it can still over time grow at the rate that we have just outlined to you in terms of revenue growth. Is that going to happen overnight? No. Can we get there? Absolutely yes. Then we have other elements to deal with in terms of trends. And so we recognize that we have to do more works of diets and lights for example, we continue to innovate. We continue to launch new products which had different sweeteners and different sweetener basis. That would continue at an expanded \u2013 in an expanded mode, more innovation, more packaging, newer ways for consumers to connect. Next year is the 100 year of the contour and we certainly, we\u2019ll expanding our I see focus in the \u2013 immediate consumption focus in the market which is really important way to build habit and build trends and build team incidents and then improve our marketing and improve our commercial strategies with our bottlers which we keep working at. And so, that\u2019s where we are. It is a very challenging environment anywhere you go around the world. It\u2019s not different. Everyone is apprehensive, whether its governments, whether it\u2019s NGO, whether its businesses, local businesses and international businesses. So, and I don\u2019t see that improving overnight, but I think it\u2019s a new normal in that new normal we need to generate better growth.\nBill Schmidt - Deutsche Bank: Great, thanks. And Kathy just one quick one, the share repurchase went from sort of range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion is a lower end of the range. Is there any read through on that why you guys took it down, I know it\u2019s not hugely substantial?\nKathy Waller: No, specific read through, I would just say that given where we are right now, this is the guidance we thought we should provide at this time.\nBill Schmidt - Deutsche Bank: Okay. But is cash flow come in softer? I\u2019m just trying to figure out why it would come down if there\u2019s no change to the cash flow algorithm?\nKathy Waller: We did give different outlook on currency which does impact cash.\nBill Schmidt - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is Michael Steib from Credit Suisse.\nMichael Steib - Credit Suisse: Good morning. I was hoping you could provide us with some more detail regarding the restructuring of your North American manufacturing footprints as one of the areas of the productivity program you talked about earlier. What\u2019s the scope of that program? What are the milestones that we should be looking for and how does that tie in with your commitment to refranchise the bulk of your territories by 2017?\nIrial Finan: Yes. It\u2019s Irial. On the supply chain North America, I mean basically this is a continuation of what\u2019s started a few years ago, and it\u2019s made up a many different aspects that we will share in due course. As Kathy has already said and Muhtar, but the key is that we\u2019re looking at becoming a more effective and more efficient. We have a very substantial supply chain footprint and we believe and have the plans to make sure we\u2019ll become truly efficient and that means by streamlining in many different ways and simple illustrations or things like bottle [light-weighting] which is pretty well carried out across the world today, whether it mechanizing at different parts of our supply chain, whether its our footprint as supply chain and so forth. So, many different aspect, but very clear plans behind this and high degree of confidence that we will achieve the synergies that we\u2019ve set out.\nMuhtar Kent: And on that once again, I wanted to reiterate the point that I made earlier. This is Muhtar. That you know of the $2 billion by 2017 and the $3 billion by 2019 incremental synergy program, that is not going down as we substantially refranchise our business in North America. Okay, any further questions.\nOperator: Our next question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Good morning. I guess first question is just relating to really the new operating model that you\u2019re planning to implement, then I\u2019m just hoping to get a little bit more clarity around exactly what you\u2019re doing to change the operating model both more at the business unit and maybe even at the country level? And is it something that gets rolled out globally or does this have phasing of kind of how it gets rolled out? And I know that you\u2019ve really have been emphasizing patients and taking time to implement these changes, but just wanted to get a little bit better sense of what takes longer \u2013 what can be implemented more quickly and where we can see the benefits to some of the changes more quickly?\nMuhtar Kent: Yes, Judy, this is Muhtar. Good morning. Yes. We are streamlining and simplifying our operating model for better speed, better decision making, and enhanced also local market focus that will help driving better growth, help us to drive better growth. And so, this work is moving forward aggressively, it\u2019s global, involve the center and involves the entire company. And we expect to refocus the role for our corporate center and further scale our back office to support our processes and also policies on a global basis to get more synergies there and better service to our business unit that operate around the world that basically makeup the Coca Cola company and this will enable those operations to fully focus intently on demand creation in their market. So, this is really important. It\u2019s a de-layered organization. It is a simplified organization. It\u2019s less touch points, its faster decision making and that will take place starting with the beginning of the year and more will \u2013 you\u2019ll hear more about that in the coming weeks. So, that\u2019s important. And I think it\u2019s important to -- if I take just a back a minute and just to say again, this is a certainly a difficult operating environment and that is clear, no question about that. But today, we\u2019re announcing I believe definitive actions as a team to address that environment and improve our execution. The $3 billion in synergy enhancements are an added layer of segmented analysis on top of the $3 billion and metrics on a market-by-market basis is clear evidence I think of us taking action to control in a way what we can control. And this is \u2013 I\u2019m so pleased we have a team that has basically worked together for a long time and we know what it takes to win. Today, we are taking essentially additional steps to get us back on track over the longer term and we will do whatever we have to do to get there, to get us across to that bridge. We know it can be done and we know we will do it. And I think the synergy program will help, the new operating model will help, the enhanced execution will help, the better marketing will help and the improved commercial strategy will help along those lines. Is the operating environment tough? It is tough. But we are fortunate to be in the business that is one of the most dynamic businesses in the world, the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink business. And so that what I would leave you with.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then, if I could just follow-up maybe Ahmet just the two markets were obviously the volume was very challenged, where Europe and China which presumably had both the weather impact as well as the macro impact. So if you can give us a little bit of color just in terms of how much you think the weather did play a role? And then it sound like in the fourth quarter you really are not anticipating much improvement globally from a volume perspective, or is the weakness that expected in these two markets primarily or are other markets that you think could potentially be weaker or volatile as you get into the fourth quarter?\nAhmet Bozer: Thanks, Judy. And you know we don\u2019t like to talk about weather too much in this. But I would say there was probably not so favorable weather. You mentioned the macros, let me start with China. You could see from the numbers in China that total food and beverage industry, NARTD industry is actually under pressure and the growth rates are coming down. But I\u2019m very pleased with our performance in China, because now we can see a lot of traction on sparkling beverages which actually grew in the quarter, trademark Coke was up 4% in China, which shows that the strategy that we have shared with you all beginning of the middle of last year, of segmented focus of our beverage in China is actually working. We\u2019re very pleased with our new launches of the isotonic that\u2019s doing very well. Very pleased with our innovations in sparkling with things like Schweppes plus. So, for China, I\u2019m very pleased with the results and we\u2019re gaining share and our initiatives are working for us. When it comes to Europe, I have shared with you all the little earlier, it is more a matter of balancing our price realization and volume a little bit more in the favor of volume and share still realizing good price mix, I would say other than that Europe performance was mostly to do with the macros and you mentioned whether I will not. Unidentified Analyst Got it. Okay.\nMuhtar Kent:  Thank you.\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question is from John Faucher from JPMorgan.\nJohn Faucher - JPMorgan:  Thank you. I guess a couple of questions here. One on sort of the change to the long term algorithm and you talked about NARTD growth being more mid-single digits I guess going forward, is that going back to Bill Schmidt\u2019s question, is that going down permanently from the 6% number that you guys had put out there before you structurally calling for lower category growth. And then the second question I had related to the restructuring program I guess two questions on this, first, is it the macros is it the lower structural growth of the category that\u2019s causing you to up this just eight months after your last program. And then a clarification on the numbers which is part of the savings program announced in February related to not necessarily productivity but more efficient spending? Is there any of that\u2019s built into this new $2 billion? Thanks.\nMuhtar Kent:  Hey John, this is Muhtar. I think when you look at the current revenue figure that we\u2019ve put out there, if you take the middle \u2013 midpoint of that it\u2019s only you know 50 basis points difference than what was out there before earlier. So I don\u2019t see that as a major difference in terms of the category, in terms of the cyclical long term macro economic. I think we see tremendous opportunity in this segment, in this consumer, very dynamic consumer goods industry. So I see that, that\u2019s not any major shift. We\u2019ve been pleased with productivity in terms of what we\u2019ve done to date. Macros have not improved and so we have to do what we need to do in order to ensure that we can cross the bridge and get to a better both topline growth as well as bottom line delivery of performance. And that\u2019s what you see us doing right now. This is \u2013 in the past you know you would have cycles and macro you would have two to three year, a year or two years of down and then coming back up. Now its constant volatility and constant actually more increased volatility everyday around the world, and increased apprehension by the consumer. So we had to do more. We have to ensure that we have a creative mix ability to deliver our results and that\u2019s what you see us doing.\nJohn Faucher \u2013 JPMorgan:  Got it. And I guess, can I just follow \u2013 and again I \u2013 just a clarification on the sort of reallocation versus sort of where we review with incremental cross saves any color on that?\nMuhtar Kent:  Kathy you want to add anything to in terms of the investments, in terms of the efficiency what John talked about?\nKathy Waller:  Sure, Muhtar. So in the \u2013 first of all going back to the first question around the net revenue. The two things that are primarily driving the change would be the value growth that we see coming from Emerging market as well as the guess mobiles and nature of the emerging markets and then a recognition that our partnership models would drive value for the business that will impact that with the income, so I just wanted to add that particular point. And then on the productivity, I \u2013 don\u2019t remember the productivity question\u2026.\nJohn Faucher \u2013 JPMorgan:  What I was asking is if I remember correctly that the February productivity program, excluded some through productivity and then some sort of reallocation of spending to more efficient methods. What I\u2019m asking is there of that also built into the incremental $2 billion from to that?\nMuhtar Kent:  Yes, there actually is John. In terms of the way, what we have done in the past is we\u2019ve said that productivity \u2013 the origin of billion is made up of both OpEx as well as reallocation of marketing to ensure that marketing is more effective and more efficient in terms of its delivery of results. And so that is an ongoing program that we have in terms of how we will continue to reallocate marketing to drive better value and better return. That is there. That is ongoing, however, of course the scale of what we are doing in terms of OpEx flexibility is going to be much much bigger here and \u2013 but the vast majority of the additional savings programs is hard savings in productivity. The vast majority is hard savings as opposed to reallocation. We will ensure that amount of money that\u2019s invested has a return, that\u2019s a different answer but we will make it is actually I would say the majority; vast majority in fact is higher savings.\nJohn Faucher \u2013 JPMorgan:  Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel Nicolaus.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks, good morning. Also on the subject of media and marketing spend, when all is said and done Kathy or Muhtar for calendar \u201914 you mentioned a double digit increase in media in the quarter, but when we look at the total marketing spend, how much do you think that will be up one all said and done for \u201914. And then when we think about the comparatively lackluster \u201915 you are talking about how much of that is attributable to the rate of increase in marketing spend you are intending next year?\nMuhtar Kent:  I think when all said and done, I\u2019d say probably Mark, it will be about mid-single digits in 2014 and I think we\u2019ll give you again in December we\u2019ll come back and give you more flavor about how we are thinking of that in 2015 and beyond.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus:  Is there anything \u2013 is it reasonable to assume it goes up at a faster rate in \u201915 given the topline challenges?\nMuhtar Kent:  I wouldn\u2019t assume that.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus:  Okay. And just one point of clarification back on John\u2019s question about the 3 billion, you mentioned Muhtar vast majority being OpEx are you talking 80%, 70%, 90% can you give us some sense of that number?\nMuhtar Kent:  Look I said the vast majority is hard savings in productivity programs. And that is composed as I mentioned earlier in answering another question that is composed of a base of about 9.5, 10 billion comprises of marketing and OpEx and then another base which is about \u2013 driving about 1.5 billion by 2019 and other 1.5 billion by 2019 is driven by COGS savings, but these are hard savings, not in terms of just soft or reallocations.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus:  Got it. Okay. Great, thanks Muhtar.\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Powers from UBS.\nSteve Powers - UBS:  Great. Thanks, two questions if I could. I guess first, despite I guess some disappointments in some quarters, from a strategic standpoint this does seem like a fairly substantial change from where you were in July strategically. Can you talk about the process that you went through internally to get here, do you view these changes more reactive or proactive, and to the extent that much of the work has really been accelerated since mid-summer how confident are you that this is the right program, why is 2 billion for example the right number and not three or some other figure? That\u2019s like kind of the first question. And secondly, as you seem closer to a defined timeline for refranchisement in North America. Can you help us dimension the financial terms and the economics of that activity, just in broad brush strokes acknowledging you\u2019ll probably cover more this December, but do you anticipate refranchising to result in an economic loss or gain versus your 2010 investments and how much dilution should we expect as we go forward to the program again just in broad brush strokes? Thanks.\nMuhtar Kent:  Yes, this is Muhtar. First, I think the base on the collective judgment of myself and my team we \u2013 as I said to you this is an acknowledgment of continuing difficult operating environment and controlling and taking action to control what we can control. That will mean two things, create a flexibility to the synergies and also ensure that we can enhance our margins and build a credible and sustainable revenue growth on the topline, that is the key here which this industry lends us to believe and clearly the history has shown that this industry is the most dynamic and it continues to be and therefore we believe that when we segment our markets in the way we have segmented them continues to ensure that we have the right metrics in place and the right incentives in place that we will perform better. And we\u2019re almost finished with this year and we are going to be embarking upon implementing this now so that we can start the year running and we will give you a very clear dashboard in December where you can, with three or four things to follow you can judge our progress, judge our progress as to how we\u2019re implementing and generating the results out of this program. That to me, I think is going to be key following our progress and we will follow it and you will be able to follow it. We\u2019ll give you that dashboard so that you can ensure that every quarter we can have a discussion on the key four or five elements of success on how we implement, how we implement the operating model, how we implement better marketing, how we implement better commercial strategies and how that\u2019s impacting the topline and what impact that\u2019s having on margins. As far as you know the North American franchising, I\u2019ll ask Sandy to comment on that, but again, it\u2019s a clear timeline, first by 2017 and then what we will have left is about one third and then what we do with the rest is latest by 2020 again finding the right home, Sandy.\nSandy Douglas:  Yes, sure Steve on North America refranchising, I go back to the objectives of the effort which is to restructure a system that has been placed for over a 100 years to get it in better position for growth, with better focused customer management and more efficient product supply and back services and to refranchise to the best Coca Cola bottlers in the United States under a new franchise agreement that is fit for purpose for growth. And we are very optimistic about our ability to deliver that kind of growth profile and to do that in a way that makes our business more economic and makes our system more economic going forward. So as we point to the December discussion that Kathy is going to lead will have a number of the details that will help you model this going forward, but our strategic mission has not changed and our optimism for success in doing this with our bottlers is as high as ever.\nMuhtar Kent:  So thank you, Kathy, Ahmet, Sandy, Irial and Tim despite gaining global value share our year-to-date performance is not where it needs to be. The scope and pace of our actions have to increase and we\u2019re moving very quickly to streamline our operations and further align our incentives to drive revenue growth while simultaneously driving costs out of our business through an aggressive plan. While the short term macroeconomic environment remains challenging, we are confident in our ability to return sustainable growth as the long term dynamics of our industry remain promising. Our brands and our global system are unparallel and we are all fully dedicated to strengthening our position as the world\u2019s leading beverage company. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.\nOperator:  Thank you. And this does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Please look on our website for this information. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Jackson and good morning, everyone. Earlier this year we established five global strategic priorities to restore our global growth momentum. Halfway through the year, I am pleased to report that we've delivered another quarter of sequentially improving performance results. While I am pleased with this year-to-date progress, we're conscious of the fact that we still have more work to do. In spite of continued sluggish global economic growth, the beverage industry remains vibrant. Consumers today have a wide array of beverages to choose from than ever before and our system is responding by evolving the way we operate leveraging our strength to create new competitive advantages. Our second quarter and year-to-date performance results reflect the steady progress that we are making and that we expect to continue as we further solidify the foundation for long term sustainable growth. We closed out the second quarter with 3% global volume growth, including global sparkling growth of 2% and importantly price mix increased 2% on a consolidated basis as we strive to deliver balanced volume and revenue growth. We're seeing a number of encouraging signs across our global operating system. In the second quarter, brand Coca-Cola grew 1% in North America along with solid 3% sparkling price mix. We saw improving volume growth across several key markets in Europe. Eurasia and Africa continue to deliver balanced volume growth. Key markets in our Asia Pacific operations delivered strong performance including 9% growth in China, double-digit growth in India and 1% growth in Japan and we saw steady execution in the face of a challenging macro environment in Latin America. As mentioned, this progress is built on the implementation and execution of our five global strategic priorities, priorities that emerged from a disciplined fact based look at what drives results and long term sustainable growth. We know for example that great marketing, combined with great in-market execution are fundamental building blocks of our formula for long-term sustainable growth. When we conducted a comprehensive review of our business last year, we identified areas where we could improve and put a focused plan in place to address them. With that in mind, I will now provide an update on our progress against each of our five strategic priorities. Our first strategic priority is to accelerate global sparkling growth led by brand Coca-Cola. We grew global brand Coca-Cola 1%, a sequential improvement from the first quarter of 2014. As noted earlier, our global sparkling brands grew 2% in the second quarter, thanks to solid performance across our portfolio of billion dollar sparkling brands including Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Zero and Schweppes. This led our 19th consecutive quarter of core sparkling value share gains. Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Light declined mid-single digits, while this was a sequential improvement from the first quarter, we do recognize that we have more work to do here. Progress in growing our global sparkling beverages is built on proven strategies that include delivering best-in-class marketing, driving immediate consumption transactions and leading industry innovation. While I could point to multiple examples of each, I would particularly like to highlight our Share a Coke Campaign as it successfully combines all three strategies and it is being rolled out in more than 80 markets this year. The viral impact of this campaign and the engagement among teens has been more than encouraging. We're excited about the campaign's expansion, not only to new markets, but also its return for an encore in many markets. For example, this year in our Northwest Europe and Nordics business units, we're extending the program to include all Coca-Cola trademark immediate consumption and future consumption packs and increasing the number of names from 250 to 1,000 per market. This is a tremendous logistical feat and marketing achievement befitting the world's most loved beverage brand. The growth of brand Coca-Cola in North America in the second quarter gives us confidence that our focus on driving incidence, delivering best-in-class marketing and evolving our price pack architecture is setting the foundation for well balanced growth in our flagship markets. Through these efforts we are reviving the romance of brand Coca-Cola driving household penetration and increasing consumption frequency, all of which contributed to growth in the second quarter. Our smaller size packs contributed significantly to brand Coca-Cola growth in the second quarter and year-to-date. Over 60% of the volume growth in brand Coca-Cola in the second quarter was driven by double-digit growth in our mini can and 16 ounce immediate consumption packages reflecting strong consumer demand for smaller packages of ice cold Coca-Cola. So we remain optimistic about our sparkling business in North America and around the world and we're committed to supporting our brands, committed to driving execution and staying at the forefront of evolving consumer needs. Our second global priority is to strategically expand our profitable still beverage portfolio. We've delivered 5% still beverage volume growth in the second quarter and 6% growth year-to-date. Sports drinks, tea, energy, coffee and water, all contributed to global growth and enabled us to gain volume and value share in still beverages year-to-date. Juice and juice drinks growth slowed year-to-date due to price adjustments primarily to offset cost of goods increases in North America. However, we gained volume and value share in North America and also on a global basis. Overall, the global juice growth story remains very robust. We are strengthening our leading brands as demonstrated by the double-digit growth of Maaza and Rani year-to-date along with high single-digit growth for Simply and mid-single digit growth for Del Valle. Our tea volume increased 4% in the quarter growing volume and value share in the second quarter and year-to-date. Importantly our key brands within the U.S. and Japan, our two largest tea markets performed very well. Tea volume grew 6% in North America driven by double-digit Gold Peak and Honest Tea growth while in Japan tea volume grew 5% less by 8% growth of Ayataka the 21st consecutive quarter of strong growth for this dynamic brand. As a system we are enhancing our premium water brands to drive revenue while investing in our value chains to improve profitability. Examples of premium water brands growing double-digits in both the quarter and year-to-date include Smartwater in North America, I Lohas in Japan and Vio in Germany. As we focus on building great brands, we are pleased to share that Smartwater will soon be available in Great Britain and that addition of Dasani Sparkling and Dasani Drops is enhancing our brand margins in North America. Our water portfolio grew 7% in the second quarter and 10% year-to-date. In the sports drinks category we grew volume 6% in the quarter filled by our FIFA World Cup POWERADE activation. As the global value leader is still beverages and with $11 billion brands and many more in the pipeline, we are diligently working to enhance the value of our still portfolio. And as exemplified by our recent partnership with Keurig Green Mountain, we will continue to strategically target opportunities to strengthen our position and build our breadth across new categories while building category beverage debt. Moving now on to our third strategic priority which is to increase brand investments by maximizing productivity, our productivity initiatives are on track as is our commitment to increase media investments in tea markets. We are delivering more and better quality marketing by focusing on increased efficiency and effectiveness. Our global marketing campaign charters are fueling in productivity and efficiency while at the same time driving media effectiveness through higher quality communication. The example of the power of this approach is the full scale activation of our FIFA world cup campaign where single creative idea, this is the world's cup was executed across more than 170 markets in the second quarter. The success of our Coca-Cola music anthem for the 2014 FIFA World Cup reinforces the engaging nature of this campaign as the anthem reached over two billion impressions charting in the top 10 songs in 40 countries and was ranked as the number one song in Brazil at the start of the World Cup. The full impact of our enhanced marketing and productivity initiatives will clearly build over time. Our fourth priority is to win at that point of sales by unlocking the power of our system. Our global system is committed to investing in new plans, investing in new distribution capabilities, investing in coolers and marketing. Enhancing our immediate consumption capabilities, while optimizing in store activations and advancing our customers business strategies and finally putting more feed on the street to service these accounts. To that end, you may have read last week that together with our bottling partners we will be investing an additional 8.2 billion by 2020 to support our long-term business plan and vision in Mexico. Since 2010, our total system investments globally have exceeded $60 billion. Our fifth priority is to invest in our next generation of leaders. We\u2019re doing this by inspiring our people to live our values of focusing on the market, working smart, acting like owners and being passionate ambassadors for our company and for our brands. We are harnessing the potential of our millennial associates, their optimism, their global mindedness, entrepreneurialism and social awareness drive them to build sustainable practices into every aspect of what they do including right here at the Coca-Cola company. We therefore established an internal group of millennial voices and we're working with the world economic forums global shapers to provide our leaders with insights on how to continue to evolve to meet the needs of this and also future generations. We continue to focus on strengthening the core front facing capabilities of franchise leadership, commercial leadership and marketing leadership while also embracing emerging capabilities in the digital mobile and social media arena. We\u2019re working with our global bottling partners to encourage more cross system experience having company associates drawing bottlers and bottling associates join the company to instill a one-team mentality across our global system ranks. Another terrific example of how we\u2019re leaving our fifth priority is Woodruff Cup, our most prestigious internal award named after our legendary Chairman, Robert Woodruff who's tenure with the company stand from 1923 to 1985. Each year our business units President select one of their peers as winner of this award and people leadership is the key criteria. Our most recent winner at the South Latin business unit exemplifies what it means to inspire our next generation of leaders as demonstrated by the fact that women make up more than half of their workforce and that they've consistently been ranked among the top three best places to work in that whole geography. Our focus on our five strategic priorities enables us to execute the fundamentals while simultaneously transforming an advancing our business. An important example of this is our North American re-franchising effort to build the 21st century beverage partnership model. Our ongoing work is underpinned by our full commitment to create a modern, agile, consumer and customer focused operating model and system which balances national scale and local capability. As we continue to roll out and evolve business model in North America, we expect to franchise the large portion of North America territories into a handful of regional bottlers, proven regional bottlers that can best serve every local community within their contiguous operating territories. These larger bottling partners will be complemented by a select group of local bottling partners enabling us to benefit from the passion and local touch of a franchise model and to grow our business faster and more profitably over time. We\u2019re making progress and we\u2019re implementing this work by executing smaller scale transitions today so that we can seamlessly transfer larger portions of territory in the future. It is important for us to follow this deliberate process as we establish a structure to maximize long term value for our share owners while ensuring that there\u2019s no business disruption to our customers and consumers. We will provide you with additional details regarding this transformational initiative before the end of the year. In summary, and as mentioned at the beginning of the year we\u2019re committed to executing strategies that will deliver stronger growth. Notwithstanding the volatile environment in which we're operating, we\u2019re making steady and sequential progress as we invest in our brands together with our bottling partners and we expect to fall within the corridors of our long term growth algorithm in the second half of the year. Indeed, our second quarter and year-to-date performance results reflect the steady progress that we're making to restore our global growth momentum and I look forward to providing you with further updates later in the year. Now, I\u2019m happy to hand the call over to our new Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Waller, who will provide with an update on our financial performance as well as an outlook on our business for the balance of the year. Following Kathy's prepared remarks, Irial Finan, Sandy Douglas, Ahmet Bozer and I will participate in our Q&A session to address any market specific questions that you may have today. Kathy?\nKathy Waller: Thank you Muhtar, and good morning everyone. I would like to start by saying that it\u2019s an honor to serve as the CFO of The Coca-Cola Company. In my more than 25 years with the company, I\u2019ve seen our business evolve and grow over time while remaining strategically focused on doing the right things to drive long term sustainable growth, that's why I am confident about our business and I\u2019m looking forward to working with each of you. As Muhtar mentioned, we continue to execute the five strategic priorities we laid-out at the beginning of the year. We achieved 3% volume growth in the quarter and delivered sound financial results over the first half of 2014. Let\u2019s start by reviewing a few key drivers of our financial performance. Unit case growth was ahead of concentrate sales growth in the quarter, primarily due to timing of shipments. Importantly, after considering the impact of one less selling day, unit cases and concentrate sales were in line year-to-date and we expect them to be in line for the full year. Comparable currency neutral -- net revenue growth was 3% for both the quarter and year-to-date after excluding the impact of structural items. Our topline growth includes two points of positive price mix in both the quarter and year-to-date. Comparable currency neutral operating income was up 5% in the quarter and 6% year-to-date after excluding the impact of structural items. Operating leverage was even in the quarter as we continue to make the necessary investments behind our brands to accelerate growth, including a mid-single digit increase in [DME] [ph] as we invest in the growth of our brands together with our global system partners. On a comparable basis, currency unfavorably impacted this quarter's operating income by 4%, which was three points better than the outlook we provided during our last earnings call. The difference between the outlook we provided and the actual currency impact was primarily due to a new provision in Venezuela that imposed a maximum threshold for profit margins and decreased our Bolivar denominated revenue and profit. The new provision resulted in an approximate one penny drag on comparable EPS in the second quarter, which was partially offset by the impact of slight improvements in other currencies, compared to our previous expectation. Despite a difficult operating environment in Venezuela, the Coca-Cola system remains committed to the market and will continue producing and selling our products that Venezuelan consumers enjoy on a daily basis. We also benefitted in the quarter from lowering our underlying effective tax rate from 23% to 22.5% for the full year. Cash generated from operating activities was a strong $4.5 billion in the first half of the year and we continue to make capital deployment decisions based on a consistent and disciplined framework as we had outlined before. First, we reinvest in the business, which includes making the necessary investments to strengthen our brand and it includes capital investments, which we expect to be roughly $2.5 billion for the year. Second, we reward our shareowners by paying a healthy dividend, which we have increased annually for more than half essentially. Next, we evaluate opportunities to grow through acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures. We view these as enablers to help accelerate growth and create value and in a capital efficient manner. And lastly we repurchase shares. Year-to-date, our net share repurchases totaled $1.3 billion and we are on a track for net share repurchases in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range for the full year. As we look ahead for the second half of 2014, let me take a minute to update you on a few outlook items as we model our business. We previously communicated that we expect the structural items to unfavorably impact the first half of the year as we cycle the deconsolidation of certain bottling operations in 2013. However, we now expect structural items, including Venezuela to be a one to two point drag on net revenue growth and an approximate three point drag on operating income growth during the second half of 2014. The refranchise territories in North America had a nominal impact on our comparable results in the second quarter and are not expected to have a meaningful impact over the balance of the year. After considering our hedge position, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we expect a three point currency headwind and operating income during the second half of 2014 with a relatively similar impact on both third and fourth quarters and we now expect a currency headwind in the five to six point range at operating income for the full year. This is an improvement compared to the previous outlook we provided, primarily due to the decrease in Boulevard denominated revenue and profit. After taking into consideration all these factors, we expect the impact of structural items net of the benefit from the change in our underlying effective tax rate to be a $0.02 drag on comparable EPS during the second half of the year. Finally, we continue to expect operating leverage on a currency neutral basis to be even to slightly positive for the full year. In closing, we delivered sound financial performance in the first half of 2014 and we expect to continue our sound financial performance over the remainder of the year and I believe our company and our global system are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities within our great industry. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nMuhtar Kent: Good morning.\nKathy Waller: Good morning.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Muhtar, if I look at your second quarter performance, volume growth of 3% sequential improvement versus Q1, global price mix held steady at 2%, I guess second quarter also though benefitted in part because of easy comp and you have the Easter benefit. So can you maybe talk about your ability to sustain the topline momentum as you look out in the back half of the year and be mindful of some of the macro economic conditions that you see in the marketplace?\nMuhtar Kent: Thanks Judy. Well again just to quickly go through the quarter, as you said, volume was up 3%, sparkling volume really importantly was up 2% and brand Coca-Cola up globally and in North America. Those are really three important points. Also another quarter of value market share gains. I think more than 25 consecutive -- 28 to be exact in the second quarter of gaining value share. You see us having a very -- with our system, very clear focus on priorities. We had our entire global bottling system get together with us a couple -- few months ago and again, there a recommitment to the focus on our priorities. Sequential improvement in a lot of large markets, particularly Europe, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Spain and again good results, very strong results out of Eurasia and Africa, improving in Nigeria, South Africa, Turkey; improvements again if you take Asia Pacific again very strong quarter in China as well as in India. Double-digit growth in India, Thailand, saw again -- so if you take all of those margins that are improving, gross margins has improved in the quarter compared to the prior year. Clear path on North America franchising, strong belief that what we are doing is working in our system is really important. Good bottler alignment, yes, there are a couple few exceptions, but there always have been and will be and more work to be done. So on the purchase, we operate in a very volatile global environment, both politically and economically. China slowing down is impacting many commodity exporting countries and from Africa to Latin America, but overall, what we're doing is working more marketing through productivity gains, better marketing. We mentioned Share a Coke program in over 80 markets. Tremendous leverage on our World Cup program in more than 170 markets with probably the biggest activation that we've ever had and all these -- all this will not generally have an impact on the quarter that you spend in. It comes in after with better incidence, better brand loyalty, better purchase intent that we're all seeing and what is happening in North America in terms of spot -- in price mix also, you can see that we have a very disciplined approach, both in the United States and globally where we've been able to achieve a 2% price mix on a global basis and yes, there was an Easter shift, but at the same time, our gallon shipments were below our unit case volume for the quarter. So that -- if you say that that would sort of neutralize the benefit that we may have got from Easter, I think overall, we feel pretty confident with again the caveat that we need to do a lot more work -- continue to do a lot more work, more focus, better execution, but the five priorities are working and early shoots, green shoots, and we expect that the balance of the year as I mentioned in my script that we should be able to fall within the corridor of the long term growth targets and again there may be issues along the way, bumps along the way, but the most important thing is that we're resolutely focused on continuing to build momentum here.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. That's helpful. If I can just quickly follow-up on North American pricing particularly in the sparkling side where you got the 3% in the quarter, maybe a little bit more details around the drivers of that weather it was how much was mix versus rate and sort of your views on whether you can sustain that kind of pricing and maybe even fee acceleration if you look at the next\u2026\nMuhtar Kent: Sure, I'll say a few things and pass it over to Sandy, but all I would say is take note of the fact that a very big portion, percentage 60% to be exact of the growth came from smaller packages that's obviously an enhancement of the mix driving revenue, but also rate. So I'll ask Sandy and then may be Irial, if he has any commentary on North America, but we are operating with tremendous diligence and discipline in the marketplace and success for us is a combination of both the growth that we have on the volume, but importantly also growth in transaction, which is a really good litmus test of the success of the business that is coming more into play each day as we progress. Sandy?\nSandy Douglas: Thanks Muhtar. Hi Judy. We said at the beginning of the year that our focus in North America was going to be a disciplined combination of volume and price and that we would see that as a strategic priority and the second quarter really reflects that 3% price mix on sparkling while achieving volume growth on Coke and Muhtar mentioned the importance of smaller packages in driving that outcome. It's also important in driving growth because consumers want smaller packages and we've been working on developing that as a part of our overall strategy, so lots of discipline. As we ahead, we're lapping some very promotional activity in the third quarter of last year and our discipline will remain and the bottlers and the company around the country are focused on marketing and selling our way through and maintaining an extraordinary amount of discipline on pricing and we're optimistic that we'll be able to hold that strategy.\nIrial Finan: Hi, it's Irial. I guess all I can add is really repeat what Sandy said and I've said in the last three calls now which is we really are focused on building a long term sustainable business and that's mixing pricing and volume and transactions in a very balanced way and coming up with a great result for our company and we will do that and we will continue to do it.\nMuhtar Kent: Yes, one thing -- the only thing I would add here also Judy is that I think there is -- we see a path forward to being able to build more romance with the brand through smaller packages and that's really an important element in what is also being discussed.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from John Faucher from JPMorgan.\nJohn Faucher - JPMorgan: Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to get a clarification if I could. When you talk about the $0.02 impact, you mentioned it was comparable EPS, but it sounds like that's sort of reported EPS as well, is that correct?\nMuhtar Kent: Yes Kathy.\nKathy Waller: Sure. Hi John. Thanks for the question. So Venezuela impact, yes. That is a $0.02 drag on comparable EPS as well as reported EPS. So as you look at Venezuela, you take it in two pieces. The currency impact as well as the impact of the provision. The provision is less Boulevard denominated revenue. It can't move because of capped margins and it has gone straight to the bottom line and then the FX is -- the impact is because as well we don't have as much Boulevard denominated revenue and income. So you could split those two pieces and yes, it is comparable as well as, as reported.\nJohn Faucher - JPMorgan: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then Kathy if I could just sort of follow-up, we're continuing to see sort of weaker volumes in some of the higher margin regions like Latin America or Europe what have you, so can you talk a little bit in terms of how you are going to look at -- how should we think about margins going forward, if these types of -- if this type of relative weakness in some of these higher margin markets continues to particularly Latin America, which is your highest margin region and it's been a little bit softer over the last couple of quarters, thanks.\nKathy Waller: So, I would split them -- the question is two and actually Ahmet, help me answer with it, but the margins in Latin America are impacted this quarter by the Venezuela provision and then when you look at ongoing volume growth and contribution to the company, I'll let Ahmet\u2026\nAhmet Bozer: John hey, just couple of points. Rest of Latin America the margin and the growth and profitability overall is in a good direction. No important issues there. Also keep in mind that we've been able to realize positive price mix and high margin in places like Europe. We've been able to grow in Japan. So we are able to balance across the international territory to have positive price mix and margins.\nJohn Faucher - JPMorgan: Okay. Great.\nMuhtar Kent: Just to add I think yes, you are right in saying that Latin America has slowed down to where it traditionally has been and we've seen this kind of cyclical slowdowns in Latin America and as some parts will get better, I think starting with towards the end of the year. We also see some other volatility -- continued volatility in like Argentina and other markets, but overall I think we from also what we're cycling as well we expect Latin America -- major markets in Latin America to have some sequential improvement in the second half of this year. And then overall longer term we feel very confident about also what is lying ahead in Latin America.\nJohn Faucher - JPMorgan: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, good morning.\nMuhtar Kent: Good morning, Bryan.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Kathy, I wanted to follow-up on John's question just relative to leverage and I guess there are two parts to it, one just I think I caught in the prepared comments that you mentioned that on a comparable currency neutral basis you would expect -- you would expect some leverage in the second half. So I am just trying to make sure I heard that correctly and that we should be thinking about ex-Venezuela impact and ex the structural change in currencies that would be currency neutral operating profit growth. And then second question is if I am done the calculations correctly, it looks like on a comparable basis, currency neutral gross margins in the quarter were up. So if you could just talk a little bit, A, is that true and; B, if you could talk a little bit about how you would expect gross margins to evolve going forward. Kind of what type of inflation you are seeing and just sort of how -- what factors you might see driving gross margins in the second half?\nKathy Waller: Okay. Hi Bryan. Thanks for your question. So our outlook for leverage on a currency neutral basis remains flat to slightly positive and we've said -- when you think about gross margins, so gross margins have improved for the second quarter and year-to-date and I think when we look at -- I guess when we look at our margins for the back half of the year, we have we delivered sound financial results and we anticipate that we will continue to deliver sound financial results for the quarter -- for the back half of the year. So we do anticipate that margins will continue to be -- will continue in the same way that they\u2019ve been in the first half of the year.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So there's nothing unusual about the gross margins in the first half we could potentially see more progress on gross margins and we're just spending more back, which is what's getting the leverage to slightly flat is that what you think about it?\nKathy Waller: Yes, we can say we invest behind our brands and we -- so yes, that is part of the leverage story, but that's causing like in North America some negative -- slight negative leverage and North America because we are spending behind our brand. So we are getting pricing and we are committed to rational pricing. So we're getting pricing, which is helping us with the margins -- the gross margins, but we are continuing to invest behind our brands.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Excellent. Thank you.\nMuhtar Kent: Just to add to that Bryan, if you look at the second quarter compared to the first quarter, marketing is substantially higher in the second quarter than it is in the first quarter and particularly towards the back end of the second quarter, substantially higher. So that explains and some of the things again what Kathy was saying, but also our productivity is on target for -- it has been on target for the first half of the year and will be on target for the second half.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Steib from Credit Suisse.\nMichael Steib - Credit Suisse: Good morning. Can I ask a couple of questions -- could of specific questions on Latin America, first on Brazil given all the investments you made in the market and the World Cup, I was just wondering why volume performance wasn\u2019t stronger in the quarter. You mentioned in the release a tough macro environment and some competitive activity, but I was hoping you could give us bit more detail. And then second with regards to Mexico, I know you\u2019ve taken all the pricing related to the tax increase early in the year, but have you also passed on pricing now for general inflation in the country. Thanks.\nMuhtar Kent: Michael, its Muhtar here and I'll Ahmet to provide additional commentary, but think of Brazil as having a very tough macro environment in the first half, so if you look at the entire consumer disposable and non-disposable consumer durable, consumer goods sectors, we're under tremendous duress in the first half of the year, particularly leading up to the -- particularly it's more so even in the second quarter. So think of it this way. Had it not been, the result would have been perhaps not what it was -- it would have been had we knocked on all that activity. So from that perspective I think we see brand as getting stronger, incidence and purchase intent getting stronger in Brazil as a result of all the activity and I think that should benefit us going forward in Brazil. So certainly the macro environment in Brazil as you can read, as we can all see, has been very challenging and so given that backdrop, I think our results were content with where we are and we believe that what we've done will benefit us in the second half and going forward. In terms of Mexico, I think both times prices were adjusted. They include a certain portion for also inflation, so take it as that, but again, I'll ask Ahmet to provide any further commentary for both Brazil and Mexico.\nAhmet Bozer: Thanks Muhtar. On Brazil, the only thing I would add Michael is that we have a pricing packaging architecture which allows us to have different tax, both for immediate and future consumption at different price points and we are executing those with great discipline and that in fact is helping us navigate this challenging external environment and we expect that to continue bear fruit in the third and fourth quarter along with the strong marketing programs we have. With respect to Mexico, the only other thing I would add is that we do have a not just passing the tax and the inflation, but a consumer-driven pricing approach, which has been very carefully calculated and the elasticity that we have calculated in reality are happening better than that we've expected. So in another words our Mexican business is showing more resilience in this area.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel Nicolaus.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Hi Kathy. I guess Muhtar as you think about the sparkling global outlook and your efforts to build on where you are here in the second quarter, is it fair to think your emphasis will continue to be on volume share gains, more so than dollar share gains or do you think there is potential for more dollar share growth in spite of the volumes being a little below what you are hoping for?\nMuhtar Kent: I think success for us is certainly continuing our value share gains. You can -- obviously you can't -- only value share gains without volume is not sustainable over the long term, but we have a very disciplined approach just like in North America also for our international business related to more smaller packs. So benefitting the mix will benefit us, but also very importantly it's critical for us to achieve price mix on a global scale. Different geographies will again play differently into the picture, such disparate pricing per case depending on which geography we're talking about. So geographic mix is an important piece of this as is package mix and as is rate.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: And could you -- obviously a lot of markets to talk about on this call and though for going into many of them, but when you look at North America specifically and you see that the 3% price mix on the carbonated and a bit of growth there on the stills, but you also have the flat volumes and then data we look at is CPI for the larger carbonated space, which continues to be down. So retailers continue to promote the carbonated component of your business. How are you thinking about the opportunity for better value share performance in North America given the volume share situation you're facing?\nMuhtar Kent: I'll just say that once again smaller size packs contributed significantly to say brand Coca-Cola volume and revenue growth in Q2 and year-to-date as a matter of fact. So if you take over 60% of the growth in brand Coca-Cola in Q2 was driven by double-digit in our mini can and 16 ounce immediate consumption packages, I think that is -- that is how I would like to leave you with. That is what I would like to leave you with as an opportunity.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein: Hi guys. So if you would have predicted back in December that price mix in North America was going to be up as much and your volumes would have remained flat and Latin America you indicated volume would have been flat even with all the Mexico tax issues, I think I would have said you are being optimistic, but that is what you are delivering, which is good, but it does raise two questions for me. One is it has concentrated your volume growth in only two of your six reporting segments, so want to get a better sense of how comfortable you are with those two currently and your expansion of volume growth in the other segments like what gives you confidence that the other ones can grow as well? And then secondly, a question about the mix between volume and price mix, which if you look over the past 10 years, it's been mainly driven by volume, obviously pricing now much more balanced, now I am trying to understand how much of that is actually a change in strategic intent that you described versus just FX driving you to raise more pricing. So if you can help with those two that would be great in a smarter volume context.\nMuhtar Kent: Ali, I'll take the last first. The strategy is driven by what consumers want and that is not just phenomenal for the United States, but smaller packages are a key focus. So that helps the mix. That helps the revenue. That helps also the price mix. Then again couple that with a very disciplined approach towards also having the right balance between value and volume share gains. And so it's really important. In terms of concentration of volume growth, I think the important thing is for you to focus on the improvements from quarter to quarter. If we take key geographies like Europe, France had an improvement, Germany had an improvement, Great Britain had a significant improvement, Italy had a significant improvement, Spain had a significant improvement, Europe overall had a huge improvement when you look at total and just again this is pure simply from volume and then if you look at our pricing and other thing you will get also a similar picture. So I think focus on the sequential improvements, focus on us delivering on our focused priorities and so what I see there is that we will strive and diligently strive to continue with sequential improvement, building momentum as we go forward and I also mentioned as an answer to a previous question that I thought Latin America we would see some also some sequential improvement.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein: Okay. Thanks and one of the things you\u2019ve announced a bunch on this conference call is about margin and margin mix and one of the things obviously that can offset margin pressures is incremental cost cutting, can you talk a little bit more about how you view incremental cost cutting versus what you\u2019ve announced so far, what you think the potential is and when you think we might hear more about more cost cutting at the company?\nMuhtar Kent: Well, we announced significant cost cuts over the last four, five years, different programs and as I mentioned earlier again we're on target with our productivity and that productivity is being reinvested to drive growth.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Powers from UBS.\nSteve Powers - UBS: Great. Thanks. Maybe building on that and focusing back on North America, as you talked about, you had good price mix realization at sparkling of 3% and you did see margin grow in the quarter, which is great. But overall, we only saw 1% price mix and year-to-date margins remain slightly below last year's level in the U.S. based on my math. So as I think about the path towards refranchise and smoothing that path, it seems to me greater profitability is a great enabler of that, is there -- what needs to be done? Is there a way to get even more aggressive on price mix realization or to Ali's point, pushing on productivity more to get the North American profit pool to expand to facilitate entry of new partners, thanks.\nAhmet Bozer: I'll talk about a couple of levers and then ask Irial to join me, but the growth in profitability in North America, the major opportunities exist in pricing and the overall effectiveness and efficiency in the system. We talked about price as a lever and a area of discipline and focus and price is achieved through rate as you know and also mix and a whole lot of innovation is going on inside of packaging to give consumers what they want and to earn a return as a result of that. Couple that with our overall system architecture work which Muhtar described earlier, which is on track as we overhaul IT product supply, as we overhaul customer management and shared services and the refranchising progress, which is on track with our bottlers, we'll create a system that is on one hand more effective and grows faster and on another level is more efficient generating better margins. But at the end of the day, that combination needs to be built on accelerating growth and a focus of the near term has been to reinvest the proceeds into marketing to rebuild brand momentum and brand momentum at price point and we're optimistic about the progress, but we have a whole lot more work to do.\nIrial Finan: The only add I would give is delivering to the packing houses is we remain absolutely committed to deliver one of our core priorities, which is excellence and execution in the marketplace and as every day goes by, I get more comfortable that we're starting to do things better every day, every time we go an outlet and fundamentally that's the other piece that actually gives us the capability to get extra price or mix in the marketplace and we will continue to do that and it's a journey. It's not turning the light switch on is happens day by day, week by week, month by month and I feel pretty good that over the next number of years, our capability in the marketplace admires the great marketing is going to deliver the kind of price mix we all desire and that's why the discipline in remaining focused on price mix married with transaction growth and married with volume is why we feel confident about our North America business over the long term.\nSteve Powers - UBS: Okay. Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Schmidt from Deutsche Bank.\nBill Schmidt - Deutsche Bank: Hi. Good morning.\nMuhtar Kent: Good morning.\nBill Schmidt - Deutsche Bank: Can you just comment about some of the market share losses in Mexico, Brazil and then on most about the U.K., so what do you think is driving that and then when do you think some of those trends are going to reverse because some of these losses are fairly substantial I think it was like a little over a point of value share and scan channel loss in Brazil about a point in Mexico and then similar trends in the U.K.\nMuhtar Kent: Bill, I think in the U.K. most of that loss was in Q1. If you look at Q2, we've had sequential improvement in the U.K. and we expect that going forward in both Mexico and in Brazil that more minor losses to brands and local players will reverse themselves in the course of the year and we always see that happening in both markets. So I think that was the difficult operating environment in Brazil in terms of also us having discipline in our pricing and the same goes for also Mexico.\nBill Schmidt - Deutsche Bank: Got you. So you think that your losses are really a function of may be the more aggressive pricing you took and maybe as that stabilizes this year.\nMuhtar Kent: And very transitory.\nBill Schmidt - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Great. I appreciate that. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi - RBC Capital Markets: Yes. Good morning, everyone. A quick question I had is just if you think about the quarter and how trends moved through the quarter, I am just curious if you actually saw correlation with the higher level of spending as the quarter progressed and your volume growth, just again just trying to understand if the spending is actually working and when you think about the ROI on that spend, what discrete things and specific things is Coke doing to make sure that there is a glad path of getting better return out of that spend. Thanks.\nMuhtar Kent: Yes, I think two things, spending increased as we moved through the quarter. So there was much more spending in let's say the end of the quarter than there was in the beginning of the quarter and therefore you would expect that not all that benefit is going to flow obviously into the quarter and this is again about generating long term sustainable momentum, which we believe is happening. Again I want to remind everyone that I am pleased with these results in a difficult operating environment and to get growth back into sparkling is a significant achievement to get growth back into Coca-Cola and the world globally and in the United States is a significant achievement and we will continue to focus on where we need to be quarter after quarter, one quarter at a time. I just want to say that I believe our approach is working.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy - Jefferies: Good morning and thanks for the question. So first Muhtar you talked about increasing or broadening your product portfolio, so may be without tipping your hand too much, what would be the top of your wish list by product and geography and do you still feel comfortable with your energy drink strategy? And then separately, Kathy now that you kind of bring a fresh look here, do you plan on doing anything differently from a capital structure perspective and I guess say that within the context if there is an argument to make that Coke is under-levered income and can potentially add leverage by adding leverage could add value to shareholders and we've seen a number of companies in the CPG space that have been rewarded by the market for such actions. So any thoughts there would be appreciated. Thank you.\nMuhtar Kent: Yes Kevin obviously I can't walk you through our wish list. That would be too much information to the whole market and everyone that plays in the market, but I would say our portfolio is really very rich as you saw from -- as we know from our $17 billion brands and so many more in the pipeline and again our sparkling brands that really performed well on a global basis, Sprit and Fanta and Schweppes in addition to Coca-Cola. So all of that tells me that what we're doing in different brands and creating more incidents, more transactions is working and you heard the numbers that I mentioned in tea, both in the U.S. and globally in premium waters, in juice and juice drinks, in sports drinks all of that we're pleased with a much richer portfolio than we had say three years ago and that portfolio is again yielding very good results, particularly also simply in the juice category, simply [Innocent] (ph) all those different brands that are across the world yielding very good results and again both also in China too and Southeast Asia with new innovations that are really working well for us in both the fusion of dairy and juice as well as pulpy drinks and also juice and juice drinks. And Kathy, yes.\nKathy Waller: On the second part of your question, I believe the company has always been very focused on driving long term sustainable growth and we've done that in a very consistent and disciplined way and we've clearly focused on reinvesting in the business and to accelerate growth and create value. So I believe we -- obviously we focus on making sure we have share repurchase and we do give a healthy dividend back, but we will continue basically what we've been doing focusing on driving long-term growth.\nKevin Grundy - Jefferies: So no real change on that front? Okay. Very good. Thank you.\nMuhtar Kent: Okay. Thank you, Kathy, Ahmet, Sandy, Irial and Jackson. Our performance year-to-date progressed against each of our strategic priorities and the positive signs that we're seeing in many global markets all illustrate our view that the 20-20 vision and strategic plans are solid proof points are out there, 3% growth in the quarter, global price mix of 2%, increased global media spending reflecting our confidence and building on the strength of our brand and also in our ability to engage our consumers and customers effectively and global year-to-date value share growth in our categories and so we're winning in the vibrant beverage industry and also coupled with sound financial performance during the first half of the year. So we're making steady progress and we're where we are expected to be at this stage in the year.

Please look on our website for this information. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us for an update on our first quarter performance. As you know, we started 2014 with a clear objective of restoring the momentum of our global business. This morning, I\u2019m pleased to report that our growth momentum is improving in line with our expectations. In the midst of continued headwinds, we achieved sequentially stronger 2% volume cycling 4% volume growth in the prior year quarter, despite the shift of the Easter holiday into the second quarter of this year. Comparable currency neutral net revenue growth of 2% after excluding the impact of structural items, growth of an incremental 100 million unit cases or the equivalent of 27 million incremental servings per each day and both volume and value share gains in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages with value share gains ahead of volume share gains. These topline results underscore our system\u2019s ability to leverage our occasion, brand, price, pack, channel architecture across our entire portfolio of leading brands. They are also a reflection of our ability to drive performance, improve incidents and simultaneously enhance price mix which increased 2% globally in the quarter and we increased our marketing investments, while decreasing other SG&A costs consistent with our commitment to identify savings opportunities and to increase support for our brands. From a geographic perspective, volume in our developed markets was down 1%. However, volume grew in key developed markets including Japan and Australia, while volume in North America was even. Importantly, volume grew 3% in our developing and emerging markets with China up 12% and Brazil up 4%. Both India and Russia also grew volume in the mid single-digit range while gaining nonalcoholic ready-to-drink volume and value share. We remained steadfastly focused on the five strategic priorities we announced on our fourth quarter earnings call and later, which I outlined at CAGNY. As a reminder, those five strategic priorities are as follows. Firstly to accelerate sparkling growth led by Coca-Cola, strategically expand our portfolio -- profitable sales portfolio, thirdly, increase brand investments by maximizing productivity, fourth, win at the point-of-sale by unlocking the power of our system and last but not least, invest in our next-generation of leaders. I\u2019ll devote the majority of my remarks today to talking about these strategies and the progress we\u2019re making in restoring our momentum. As usual, you\u2019ll find further operating group performance details in our earnings press release issued earlier this morning. These five important strategic priorities serve as a means to further sharpen our focus. They also serve as beacons to collectively align the efforts of our more than 700,000 system associates all around the world. Now beginning with our first priority, we are determined to accelerate sparkling beverage growth led by Coca-Cola and we\u2019ve established comprehensive strategies to do so. The foundation of this plan is to invest in and deliver great marketing to support our sparking brand. We\u2019re adding a sharpened focus with our bottling partners to increase sparkling brand penetration, as well as cold drink availability. We\u2019re overlaying disciplined occasion, brand, price, packed channel strategies, supported by revenue growth management capabilities to drive sustained value growth. We\u2019re continuously innovating to meet evolving consumer needs and also we\u2019re engaging with partners and stakeholders to promote trust and to address category misperception. These strategies to accelerate sparkling growth are solid and we expect to see improving results throughout the year. Highlights of actions we took in this past quarter included terrific Sochi Olympics Campaign executed across all over Russia supported by solid trade activations that resulted in 7% sparkling volume growth and 9% brand Coca-Cola growth, the 17th consecutive quarter of growth for brand Coke. A successful recruitment strategy in China where immediate consumption tax grow sparkling volume growth of 6%, brand Coke growth of 3% and transaction growth of 10% and ongoing sparking innovation in Japan that contributed to 3% sparkling growth in the first quarter. We clearly see growth potential in the sparkling category and along with our system partners we are investing in the wide-ranging sparkling innovation, world-class marketing and unparalleled local execution to satisfy our consumers thrust for refreshment. It is still early in our journey to restore sparkling momentum, yet we are tenaciously focused on building and improving upon this quarter\u2019s performance. This is underscored by the programs and the marketing campaigns that are already underway in the second quarter like our FIFA World Cup Campaign that has 175 countries participating, the broadest reach of any campaign in Coca-Cola\u2019s history. We\u2019re happy to share that the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour is visiting the United States this week with stops in Washington D.C. yesterday, Miami today and Atlanta and LA later in the week, from here, the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour is heading to Brazil on the final leg of its 90-country journey. The activation of this exciting global property coupled with initiatives such as our Share a Coke program with individualized personalized Coca-Cola bottles and cans continue support and innovation on Sprite and Fanta, and a wide range of new package introductions across our entire sparkling portfolio is going to bring excitement and engagement to our sparkling brands all around the world. Moving now to our second priority to strategically expand our profitable still beverage portfolio. Our still beverage brands account for approximately a quarter of our total global volume currently. Today, we are the global value leader in still beverages with $11 billion still brands more than any of our competitors. In the first quarter of this year, our still beverage volume grew 8%, while gaining both volume and value share. Given our leadership position in the industry, we are keenly focused on working with our global system partners to build strong profitable and competitively advantaged brands in fast growing and profitable still beverage category. We\u2019re building on our leading juices and juice drinks portfolio growing volume 3% in the quarter. This was fueled by exceptional brands like Simply which grew double digits in North America and Minute Maid Pulpy which grew 8% in China. This also marks our 9th consecutive quarter of value share gains in juices and juice drinks. Our growth global still -- global tea portfolio grew 4% as we delivered double-digit growth across Honest and Gold Peak in North America, as well as Ayataka and Sokenbicha in China -- in Japan, I beg your pardon. This resulted in the 10th consecutive quarter of global ready-to-drink value share gains in tea. We are leveraging our packaging leadership to expand our PlantBottle and crushable bottle packaging, creating an important point of value differentiation for brands ranging from Dasani, North America to I Lohas in Japan and we are developing a new profit enhancing beverage drop platform that now includes the Dasani, Powerade, Minute Maid and VitaminWater brands. As you will note, we continue to innovate across our still portfolio to further drive and enhance our leading position. Our third strategic priority is to increase brand investments by maximizing productivity. On the brand side and as announced earlier this year, we will grow our investments by $400 million in 2014 and by $1 billion by 2016. We began to ramp up our investments in the first quarter to support robust marketing programs like our Sochi Winter Olympics campaign across multiple markets. We\u2019re also increasing our media investments and quality in North America as evidenced by our Super Bowl ads. It\u2019s beautiful and going all the way. In Latin America, the first of our operating groups to launch the FIFA World Cup activation, viral marketing efforts targeting Millennials included short films that have already exceeded 10 million views on YouTube. And also, our worldwide marketing team is collaborating with our partners to deliver enhanced consumer experiences. A couple of examples that leveraged new technology platforms include Misfit Wearables which produces the Shine fitness tracker and Spotify, the world\u2019s leading on-demand music streaming service. Our strategic partnerships with these two companies in which we\u2019ve made minority equity investments will enable us to forge even more meaningful connections with our consumers. While it\u2019s too early to speak to results from our increased level of investments, we are confident in our plans and approach, which is based on robust analytics across our top markets. The insights from this analysis have equipped us with necessary information to prioritize both the quantity and quality of our investments across markets, across brands and across media channels. With regards to productivity, we are diligently seeking, identifying and securing efficiencies across all parts of the business. This effort is focused on standardizing and streamlining our processes, while also clarifying roles and accountabilities. Let me just provide you with three examples of how we\u2019re doing this across North America. We\u2019ve instituted an ownership cost management focus, thanks to which our associates are identifying and delivering significant savings. Second, about 50% of our plants in North America have completed an operational excellence diagnostic with the remainder scheduled to do so by 2015. This is resulting in savings of approximately $1 million for each location and following each implementation to focus on year-over-year productivity continues. And third, in our warehouse and delivery operations, we\u2019ve focused on our layout and process standardization. Thanks to initiatives ranging from real-time data transfer to smart selling, we can now optimize warehouse capacity, work more efficiently and reduce out-of-stocks. These are just a few examples of the productivity work that we\u2019re doing to identify and extract savings that will be redeployed and reinvested to drive long-term growth. We\u2019ve also made progress on our fourth priority, which is to win at the point-of-sale by unlocking the power of our system. Our focus on winning at the point-of-sale is not new. What is new is the increased emphasis on flawless execution across our system. This includes an accelerated focus on capturing new outlook and greater alignment in the execution of new brand and packaged launches. We\u2019re also intent on exceeding our Right Execution Daily or RED targets and ensuring that our products are well placed as well as merchandized to optimize our sales. This fourth priority emphasizes the importance of capability building and collaboration on all frontlines where our sales associates, drivers, merchandisers are often the final link in ensuring that our Coca-Cola and all our brands are always within an arm\u2019s reach of desire. The first quarter, we saw many concrete examples of how together with our bottling partners, we are winning at the point-of-sale, including excellent execution of our Sochi marketing campaign leading to significant share gains across almost all beverage categories in Russia, occasion, brand, price, pack, channel, architecture changes in many countries, including a significant focus on immediate consumption package reductions leading to immediate consumption volume growth ahead of future consumption growth and an improved RED penetration and scores. Right Execution Daily now covers approximately 40% of our volume, an increase of about three points over the past year. And our FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour program has now reached 90 countries, where our bottling partners have activated the program in 400,000 retail outlets. Importantly, the partnership required to win at the point-of-sale extends beyond our bottling partners to include our customers, the more than 24 million retail outlets that we proudly visit on a weekly basis. We are continuously collaborating with our customers to identify ways to add value to their business. Our fifth and final priority is to invest in our next generation of leaders both here in the U.S. and all across the world. In this context, I want to remind everyone that today is Gary\u2019s last quarterly earnings call and I want to commend and acknowledge him on an outstanding 14 years as the Coca-Cola Company\u2019s CFO.  e sincerely thank Gary for his many years of outstanding leadership service, his steady focus, countless insights and the enormous value he has helped to generate for our company and all of our shareowners. Collectively, he and his finance leadership team have carried out a thoughtful and purposeful transition. I\u2019m going to recommend that our Board elect Kathy Waller as our new CFO next week. And this is a great example of the talented and experienced bench strength that we are building with our next generation of talented leaders. I hope all of you welcome Kathy to the role of Chief Financial Officer. As our fifth priority outlines, we\u2019re committed to investing in our next generation of leaders across all levels of the Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola system. So as you can see, we\u2019re making progress across each of these clinical strategic priorities and look forward to providing you with further update as we progress throughout this year. Now, let me address a couple of other topics across our operating groups. First, there is the question of profitability in North America, where comparable currency neutral operating income declined 8% in the quarter. This decline was largely due to the impact of one less selling day and the shift of Easter into the second quarter. We\u2019ve been encouraged by the results of targeted marketing efforts in several North American markets in recent months. And we\u2019re excited about the trends that we are seeing. Enhanced marketing and disciplined retail pricing strategies in North America resulted in volume that was even to brand Coca-Cola. At the same time, we achieved a 2% increase in sparkling price/mix. We also gained sparkling value share ahead of volume share making this our 16th consecutive quarter of value share gain. Our priorities in North Americas remain very clear. As we shared in our year end call, our focus remains on building strong brands, creating customer value and enhancing our capabilities. We\u2019re streamlining the way we work and identifying ways to operate more effectively and efficiently in our sales warehouse and delivery operations. I also want to speak to our results in Europe, where our volume was down 4% as our business was adversely impacted due to the Easter shift and by ongoing macroeconomic challenges. Volume in France increased 4% and volume in Germany was even with prior year. During the quarter, our Europe group realized 10 points of price/mix, thanks to the consolidation of Innocent and to a broad focus on earnings price -- earning price across our business units in Europe. We seek to continuously earn price/mix by balancing disciplined pricing with packaging changes. A recent example of this is the transition from a straight-wall 2-liter to a contour 1.75-liter at the same price in Great Britain at the end of the first quarter. As we look ahead, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic about our outlook in Europe despite the continuing volatile operating environment. The strong and integrated programs that we have developed together with our bottling partners fuel this optimism. These initiatives will help us leverage our marketing assets, implement critical and innovative packaging and dispensing initiatives and execute impactful marketing programs during the year to come. Number of these initiatives in Europe began in the first quarter, including the FIFA World Cup promotions and three-time World Cup winner Germany offering our Coke Zero consumers a chance to win one of the 200 tickets to Brazil, a new Fanta marketing campaign and in-and-out flavors successfully launched in Austria, Switzerland, Romania and Hungary, as well as Cappy Pulpy\u2019s geographical expansion in the southern European belt. However, we\u2019re seeing most of the benefit coming during the remainder of the year due to various factors such as the timing of Easter, a ramp-up in World Cup activations as well as the timing and intensity of our marketing programs. Before handing over the call to Gary, I want to also remind you about our recently announced partnership with Keurig Green Mountain which closed in the first quarter. We believe Keurig Green Mountain is the perfect strategic partner to collaborate with, to capitalize on the many opportunities we see available in the market and we look forward to providing you with further updates later in the year. As I complete my prepared remarks, I want to reinforce that there is so much runway ahead of us and the Coca-Cola system is well positioned to capture more than our fair share of growth. This is a business that has barely tapped into its full potential. Globally, consumer populations are growing, purchasing power is increasing and spreading to a new middle class. Urbanization continues to intensify and lifestyles and consumer preferences are changing in ways that significantly favor our expanding and evolving beverage portfolio. We have an unparalleled reach with leading global brands and a bottling system that is investing for sustainable growth. Having said that, we do not take anything for granted. We fully understand that attaining our 2020 Vision will require more than just counting on industry growth. Indeed, it is up to all of us, up to our global system leaders and up to each of our associates to make the right decisions and to take the right actions that are going to enable us to seize the abundant opportunities that are before us. Gary will now provide you with some additional details on our first quarter financial performance.\nGary Fayard: Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning everyone. In the first quarter of this year, we began executing and delivering the strategic plan that we outlined and shared with you on our 2013 year end call and at the CAGNY and CAGE Investor Conferences earlier this year. Our clear and focused commitment remains a long-term value creation and the strategic priorities, which Muhtar just outlined today and they are tailored to do just that. While much work remains to be done, we\u2019re confident in our strategies and are fully committed to this plan, as we firmly believe that the Coca-Cola Company is a sustainable and great long-term growth business. As mentioned, we grew unit case volume 2%, a sequential improvement from last quarter and cycling 4% growth in the prior year. Global price mix increased by 2% and we gained both volume and value share in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in the first quarter, a constructive start towards restoring our momentum in 2014. Comparable currency neutral net revenue grew 2% after excluding structural items, while concentrate sales were even with the prior year. We do expect concentrate sales and unit case sales to be in line for the full year. Comparable currency neutral operating income grew a solid 7% after excluding structural items, while also including an increase in marketing investments in support of our brands. Comparable currency neutral earnings per share grew 5% with currency creating a 10 point headwind on comparable EPS. And for the math people in the room, you\u2019ll notice that comparable EPS declined 4%, implying a 9 point headwind. So, I just wanted to point out that the 10 point headwind is in the rounding. We generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations and our net share repurchases through the first quarter were $713 million. Our cash from operations increased significantly versus the prior year quarter, primarily because we made a large contribution to our pension plan in the first quarter of last year. Cash from operations also benefited from efficient management of working capital and these benefits were partially offset by unfavorable exchange. Because our largest pension plan is currently fully funded, I do not foresee any significant cash contributions to our pension plan in the near term. As it relates to overall cash management, as we have discussed in the past, we follow disciplined guidelines for how we use our cash to create sustainable shareowner value. First, we\u2019re reinvesting in the business to further strengthen the equity of our brands and to accelerate growth. This includes capital investments and new cooler placements, route-to-market enhancements, brand and packaging innovations and marketing investments that include not only more marketing but better quality marketing as well. Importantly, along with our increased investments, our bottling partners are also stepping up their investments, thus further enhancing growth for the overall system. Second, we continue to reward shareowners by paying a healthy dividend, which is $1.22 per share this year, a 9% increase over last year. It\u2019s worth noting that we\u2019ve increased our dividend every year for more than half a century. Third, we evaluate opportunities to grow through bolt-on acquisitions, strategic partnerships and value-added joint ventures when appropriate. Recent examples include the Keurig Green Mountain partnership, which opens up an exciting new packaging format for our brands, investments to further enhance our leading juice portfolio like Innocent and Rani and investments that allow us to broaden our reach like ZICO and Core Power. And finally we conduct meaningful regular share repurchase. As we look to the second quarter of 2014, we plan on continuing to execute our five strategic priorities and our full year plan remains firmly intact. First, let me address operating leverage. As you can see in our release, we achieved four points of operating expense leverage in the quarter as we benefited from the timing of year-over-year expenses. Consistent with what we shared with you on our year end 2013 call, our outlook for operating expense leverage for the full year 2014 has not changed. We expect to achieve even the slightly positive operating expense leverage for the full year as we increase brand investments. Secondly, let me address the outlook for currency. We now estimate based on current spot rates and hedging that currencies will have a seven point headwind on operating income both in the second quarter and for the full year. Our analysis reflects and includes the negative impact of the Venezuela currency devaluation, partly offset by improvements in other currencies as compared to the outlook we provided at the time of our year end earnings release. While we are very cautious in forecasting currency movements, we have managed through more than $2 billion of currency headwinds at the topline in the last two years. And as you know, we anticipate significant currency headwinds for the remainder of this year. As we look further into the future, we think it is unlikely that we\u2019ll have the same level of headwinds going forward. Third, I would like to comment on structural change. As we previously disclosed, the bottling transactions completed in 2013 are anticipated to have an unfavorable 1% structural impact on both our full year 2014 revenues and operating income. As a reminder, this impact hits the first and second quarter results as the Brazilian bottler transaction took place on July 3rd of last year. As Muhtar noted earlier, I have elected to retire next month after a very special and memorable 20 years at the Coca-Cola Company. And I want to congratulate Kathy Waller on being recommended to the Board for election as the company\u2019s new CFO and to reinforce my full confidence in her leadership in this position given her 25 years at the company. I have to say, as a retiring officer with this company, it is comforting to know that I leave the CFO office in great hands and that we have built a talented and deep finance leadership organization that will support both Kathy and Muhtar. It also gives me great comfort to look around this room this morning during our conference call with Muhtar, Irial, Ahmet, Sandy, Kathy and Jackson and to think about the experience, focus and dedication of this company\u2019s senior leadership. It\u2019s been a tremendous honor to serve as CFO of the Coca-Cola Company over the past 14 years and I have greatly enjoyed building long lasting relationships with all of you across our investment community. In closing, I\u2019ll also leave you with a few thoughts. First, I have every confidence that our ability to reignite sparkling growth beginning with brand Coca-Cola. Second, we are continuing to build leadership positions in still beverages, much like we have done in the sparkling category since 1886. And third, our franchise system is not only the strongest it has ever been but it also provides us with a global footprint and an invaluable local resource, all at the heart of a real value creation model. And lastly, there is nothing quite as refreshing as an ice cold Coca-Cola. So to all of you on this call, I sincerely thank you for your candor, your partnership and your thoughtful questions over the last 14 years. And I encourage you to continue to reach out to the senior leadership team for meaningful dialogue, or ways to further enhance our business and to build long-term value for you and all of our shareowners. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) The first question today is from Bill Pecoriello with Consumer Edge Research.\nBill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research: Good morning and congratulations again Gary and Kathy.\nGary Fayard: Thank you, Bill.\nKathy Waller: Thanks, Bill.\nBill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research: Muhtar, if you could talk about what gives you the confidence that Coke can hit its long-term growth algorithm in 2014 specifically? And also, when you look at the improving momentum during the first quarter, how much would you attribute to any relief you are seeing in external headwinds versus the impact of the internal actions that you are taking? Thanks.\nMuhtar Kent: Thanks, Bill. Good morning. First, let me say again that I am pleased to report that our growth momentum is improving in line with our expectations. And in the midst of still continued volatility headwinds, achieving sequentially stronger 2% volume growth, that means delivering an incremental 100 million unit cases in the past 90 days or so, that means incrementally every single day, an additional 27 million actual servings for each day. As the base grows, we are still very proud that we can continue to drive growth. And this is a quarter that\u2019s where Easter has shifted, where we\u2019re cycling 4% from prior year, whereas as I said, macro volatility continued and where we had the harshest winter in the northern hemisphere, particularly in the U.S. We don\u2019t think this is a great result but satisfying as one step in the right direction to restore momentum. Germany, U.S. was flat in the past quarter. We think given what we went through and what economies and consumer and climate. Turkey was up 2%, Japan was up 3%, France was up 4%, Brazil was up 4%, India and Russia was up 6%, China was up 12%. These show and give us the proof points that our actions are working. And I think this is the quarter again, where only a small fraction of our incremental marketing was deployed. I would say probably around -- so 5% of our total incremental marketing for the year was deployed in this first -- in this quarter. As we ramp up the quality and also quantity of our marketing, I believe that certainly we are going to drive better alignment. We have really good plans in place fully aligned with our bottling partners and I would be disappointed as would be all my colleagues and associates if we don\u2019t go back into the corridor of our long-term growth algorithm for volume growth. But also importantly, we are driving not just volume growth but we are driving immediate consumption growth, which is really important for our business. When you look at say in this past quarter, our top five countries growing, as China up 18% in IC growth, Indonesia up 9% in IC growth, Vietnam up 8%, Brazil up 5%. These are really important numbers because it\u2019s sustainable growth, it\u2019s profitable growth and it\u2019s growth in transactions, which is directly married to the health of the brands and health of our portfolio. So from that perspective again, I want to just register a cautious optimism that I feel we would be disappointed if we do not fall back into the corridor of our long-term growth algorithm for the remainder of the year in terms of the volume growth picture and also the other key metrics that follow on from there.\nBill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning. And Gary and Kathy both -- congratulations to both of you.\nGary Fayard: Thanks, Bryan.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just wanted to drill in a little bit further on Latin America and I guess sort of three topics. One in Mexico with volumes -- the volume decline was a little bit less than we thought, so if you could just talk about whether -- what we are seeing now is sort of the expected elasticity, or if there is something else in the future that might change the elasticity, so has the consumer really seen the full effect of the pricing? And then second, if you could just talk a little bit about some of the drivers of price-mix in the Latin America segment in the quarter, how much of it was driven by Venezuela? And then finally, just in terms of the Brazil comp being better sequentially, how much of that do you think is just that, maybe the consumer is a little bit better, was there anything specific that Coke did in the first quarter to drive the better performance in Brazil?\nMuhtar Kent: Bryan, good morning. Last question first, on Brazil. I think Brazil was out the gate first in terms of the FIFA World Cup activation, a lot of noise around that, lot of activation in stores. And I think that certainly we also see a little less malaise in terms of the macro environment. And again, in terms of also the relationship between durables and non-durable consumer goods was a little bit more in favor for us. So we feel that\u2019s going to continue and that Brazil will have a better year and I think the government is also aware of what they need to do, as they lead into one of the biggest events in their history, which is hosting a memorable event like the World Cup. As far as Mexico is concerned, I think sparkling volume for us was sort of in the mid-single digits decline for the first quarter. The important thing here is that because of the strength of our brands, because of also the incredible richness of our package portfolio and our occasion, brand, price, pack, channel architecture, the strength of that in Mexico, we are seeing that we are gaining market share versus both local competitors and our international competitor in Mexico as well. And again, we could start -- till early days related to Mexico but I would say that we are again executing with great precision and passion in Mexico with our great bottling partners. And then in terms of price-mix, including that favorable geographic mix, other points came as a result of high inflation in local markets. And again, I\u2019ll ask Gary to comment related to the Venezuela piece.\nGary Fayard: Bryan, Venezuela definitely contributed positively in the quarter to positive price-mix. Now with going forward, that will no longer really be the case because we have adjusted the -- as of the end of the quarter, we have adjusted the exchange rate that will be using the 10.8 exchange rate going forward for most of our revenues, a large part of the revenues in Venezuela. So that will come down but that impact is included in the latest currency forecast that I gave you. So again, some of the other currencies actually have improved from what we talked about in the February call that offset now by Venezuela. So still at the same 7% impact.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: As we are modeling price-mix in Latin America, just going forward, there is some price-mix in there that is positive, excluding Venezuela, I guess, that was what I was after?\nGary Fayard: Yes, there\u2019s definitely positive price-mix going in there. And I think the other thing to point out and Muhtar said it, I said it, but I think it\u2019s really important as you look at this quarter how we drove value share ahead of volume share. So we are definitely focused on rational pricing across the world and getting our earning price.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.\nGary Fayard: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from John Faucher with JPMC.\nJohn Faucher - JPMC: Thank you very much. And Gary, it\u2019s been great over the last 14 years, so best of luck as you move forward and Kathy looking forward to working with you as well.\nGary Fayard: Thanks, John.\nJohn Faucher - JPMC: Gary, I had to finish off with sort of one accounting question here, so you guys drove tremendous SG&A leverage in the quarter and you talked a little bit about sort of how you haven\u2019t put a whole lot of marketing spend to work yet. So, can you walk us through may be how we should think about the sales curve over the next couple of quarters and what we should look for on the SG&A line, as we look to model out the balance of the year? Thanks.\nGary Fayard: I\u2019ll try John and we\u2019ll see how this goes. But basically there, let\u2019s go to marketing first and let\u2019s talk about it in two different ways. One is, how much of the marketing is actually in the market and that\u2019s what Muhtar was referring to, how much of the marketing is actually hitting the consumer and a lot of our incremental spend actually has not hit the consumer yet, it\u2019s much more weighted starting in the second quarter on through Q4. A lot of the first quarter really focused on getting the quality of our marketing up and that\u2019s what we think. That is different from the way we account for marketing and marketing as you reference is on the sales curve. So on the sales curve, that incremental marketing is included in what we expensed in the first quarter. Now, then, we get into the marketing that we are cycling quarter by quarter from last year. And so, it was an increase in marketing in the first quarter, the increase will significantly grow during the year based on what we are cycling. That is part of what I said, that 4 points of operating leverage will go to even the slightly positive and we are also benefiting from some other timing in the first quarter in just some of the OpEx expenses as well.\nJohn Faucher - JPMC: Okay. And then Muhtar, if I could ask you a follow-up question on, you talked about the strength of the bottling systems and obviously the equity income line is getting hit by FX but we have seen some comments from Amatil in terms of what\u2019s going on there and then also SAB talked about cutting some positions in their soft drink business. Can you just talk a little bit about the mood of the bottlers and what they\u2019re seeing now and how we should look at some of the headwinds they\u2019re facing in the shorter term and how that may be will differ with what happens in the longer term there? Thank you.\nMuhtar Kent: Yes. I would say the mood is positive in terms of their willingness to invest, their appetite for new territories. I\u2019ve always -- you\u2019ve heard me say this before in terms of litmus test for the health of the business. There is a lot of appetite for growing horizontally in territory and trying to get expand. And I think in terms of the quality of our marketing, in terms of the quantity of our marketing, I feel that based on all the bottlers that I have questioned in this past quarter, I feel good, I feel positive about the sentiment both here in the United States, as we start our path to franchising and as we look at how we expand and how we hasten the pace of franchising but also across the world. I\u2019ve recently been with many bottling leaders and talked to many of them. We have a global system meeting next month also where about 50 of the top bottlers get together with their CEOs and Chairman. And we are there to further align our plans for 2015 and beyond but I feel good related to the plans in place, related to everyone\u2019s desire to execute better and to invest more into the future. And again, based on the investments that have gone into the marketplace in the third and fourth quarter of last year, I feel -- that\u2019s why I feel confident that you are going to see us back into the corridor of the 3% to 4% long-term growth algorithm for the balance of the year, as we keep restoring momentum. So that\u2019s what I would say. Do we have some pockets of challenges? You mentioned them Coca-Cola Amatil. I feel again very cautiously optimistic as Alison Watkins assumes a new role there and we are working very closely with her and her team. And again, we are very much aligned to how we move forward with SABMiller and their management team related to their non-alcoholic beverage business.\nJohn Faucher - JPMC: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And I also echo my congratulations to Kathy and Gary, it\u2019s been great, we will miss you.\nGary Fayard: Thank you, Judy.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. So just wanted to may be delve a little bit into Europe in the quarter and the question number one, just relating to Great Britain, obviously sparkling being down double-digits. If you can give us some context of trends that you\u2019ve seen throughout the quarter and sort of strip out some of the one-off factors with respect to the Easter timing as well as some of the transition into the 1.75 liter packaging and whether you\u2019re seeing some improvement there. And then just in terms of Southern Europe, we are hearing more from some of the consumer companies that things are trending a little bit better in markets like Spain and Portugal. So may be you can also just give us whether we are seeing a similar improvement for your business in that part of Europe?\nGary Fayard: Thanks, Judy. I will ask Ahmet to give you a response on to your question. Ahmet?\nAhmet Bozer: Thanks Judy. Yeah, the results obviously for Europe for the first quarter was less than what we would have desired with minus 4%. A lot of things came into play with that. You mentioned, the Easter obviously that was definitely a factor and Muhtar has mentioned the transition into a new future consumption back in GB. I would add to that that there was sort of a pricing activity in the marketplace on future consumption facts that had also had some impact and we are in very close discussion on alignments with our bottlers to make sure that we actually sort of respond in a way that we maintain rational pricing in the marketplace but also balance volume growth and value growth at the same time, so that was one. You\u2019ve mentioned Southern Europe, the slight improvement that everybody sees in Iberia and Spain that we see as well. Our numbers had a bit of noise and it\u2019s with regards to the strike in our Iberian bottling partners that you all have heard about before. We\u2019ve had great mitigation plans in place and executed them and the negotiations at all the sites, the restructuring is expected to end in May and we will continue to see improvements in our Iberian business as well. So we expect, as we move into quarter two, remove the effect of Easter, fully implement OBPPC in GB and continue to finish our restructuring in Spain. We expect to see improvements in Europe over the next quarter and the rest of the year.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Great. And then if I can just follow-up on North American just on the pricing side. So sparkling up 2% seems encouraging but the broader North American pricing kind of being flattish. How should we think about that going forward? Do you expect to see the still pricing being a little bit more pressured or do we see improvements there going forward for the broader North American pricing turning positive?\nMuhtar Kent: Yeah. Judy, this is Muhtar. Let me just frame again. Just a couple of important takeaways for Britain\u2019s rational pricing. It was really the theme for us in Q1 and the strength of our marketing program, the strength of our commercial program leaves us to believe that we will see improvement as we go into Q2 and Q3 and Q4 in Britain. That will take a while I would say. Again, the same phrase and motto for our U.S. business, rational pricing that\u2019s the takeaway and we had 2% to 3% price mix in our sparkling portfolio in the U.S. and you\u2019ll see that continuing. And I will ask Sandy to -- and Irial to reflect on our further details on that.\nSandy Douglas: Thanks, Muhtar. The pricing, we expect pricing for the full year in sparkling to actually improve from the first quarter. Our plans are in place with our customers, the market is rationale, our focus on immediate consumption growth will drive mix and our rate should continue to be healthy and even improved as we move through the second quarter and into the third quarter where we\u2019re lapping some promotional activity. So that\u2019s point one. Point two is on still, the case packed water business continues to grow, so it pulls down mix. We see opportunities however on a targeted basis in our can sales and improved pricing and we\u2019ll take action to do that. Paul, Irial and I see opportunities on a category-by-category basis. And then finally in our chilled juice business, we\u2019ve just fielded an increase to respond to the commodity issues with orange juice in Florida and that\u2019s taking root and our juice business continues to be advantage from a share perspective. And I think all of that wraps up from the pricing standpoint to a much more favorable profit outlook for the full year. I mean we saw some timing related issues. And obviously we\u2019ve talked about having one last selling day in the first quarter but all of that\u2019s going to come together with our price and volume plan for the year to produce profit growth for the full year. Irial?\nIrial Finan: Good. The only add I\u2019d give is we\u2019re about building a long-term sustainable, profitable business in the U.S. And to do that with most of the balance of pricing and volume growth and pricing is a really critical part of that. And we will, in this year, end up with sparkling to 2% to 3% range in pricing or price/mix I should say. And that\u2019s really is and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on, that\u2019s what Sandy and the team, Paul and the team, all of us together are focused on delivering that, delivering a healthy business that\u2019s going back to growth as well.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Michael Steib with Credit Suisse.\nMichael Steib - Credit Suisse: Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment on the performance of your key markets in Asia and particularly, China and Indonesia. The China volumes have rebounded quite strongly now for two or three quarters and I was just hoping you could shed some light on what\u2019s being driving that? Whether the new strategy, the new team that\u2019s being put in place there, whether that\u2019s all paying off or whether it\u2019s really mostly due to relatively low comparison basis still. And then similar question on Indonesia, volumes continue to be strong there, just wondering what\u2019s driving that?\nMuhtar Kent: Yeah. Michael that\u2019s Muhtar. I\u2019ll say just a couple of top line and then ask again, Ahmet to contribute. But yeah, I\u2019ll repeat what I said about IC, particularly, pleasing was China, IC was up 18%, Indonesia IC was up 9%, Vietnam up 8%. These are really important for us as we drive profitable growth in our business. And again, our newly architected packaging, our portfolio in China is really working with the smaller packs and the new price points. And I think also the new team certainly is really delivering what we expect of them as well as our bottlers with renewed focus. Both our bottling investments group but also Swire as well as Copco really doing a good job in the first quarter. And I think lot of really good investments and activity and commercial leadership is in place to continue to drive that momentum both in the stills as well as in the sparkling portfolio in China. And so again Ahmet, if you want to just highlight\u2026\nAhmet Bozer: Yeah. I think Michael you listed a lot of reasons that my headline will be as all of the above but let me color it a little bit. Certainly the new team and the new strategy that we covered with you last year is really coming together nicely. And we\u2019re happy with the quality of the growth, sparkling\u2019s growing, juices are growing and those are the category that we told you that we were betting on for our growth in China. You might see growth in waters that is an important category. But we\u2019ve just had some recent launches into a 2RMB water, which improves the profitability of that very, very early days and it\u2019s doing well. Also we\u2019re quite encouraged with again very early results on some of our innovation which Schweppes be plus and just couple of weeks out, the plant is our isotonic. So we\u2019re getting that good mix of sparkling juices and innovations that is beginning to work for us. I would just caution us though, you did mention the easier cycle race from last year, that is definitely the case and 12% growth we\u2019re very happy with. But we would expect to see growth in China, continued growth in China, probably in the range of mid-to-high single-digit that we could expect over time. So that\u2019s basically I think covers everything.\nMuhtar Kent:  And just one other point I\u2019d highlight Michael is Japan is very pleasing that it grew 3% in sparkling and stills grew 4% in Japan in the quarter. And again, despite the longest monsoon that I have ever experienced in terms of season and how long it took, India grew 6% and should do much better going forward. And so again, I\u2019m certainly very proud that this is the 31st consecutive quarter of growth in India for us and including continued share gain.\nMichael Steib - Credit Suisse: Okay. And then Indonesia, could you just comment similarly?\nMuhtar Kent: Yeah. And again that\u2019s -- Michael that\u2019s a very important market for us and we have been focused on aligning with our bottling partner, Amatil there on a new plant or let\u2019s say, an evolved plant as was the case in China. It was the revised OBPPC investments in sparkling and still beverages. There\u2019s been a recent change in management on the ground. And all of that again, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic about the progress we\u2019re making in Indonesia, are beginning to deliver good results. Certainly, that market has so much more opportunity to grow in the coming years.\nMichael Steib - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley: Good morning. First, Gary congrats on a great run and best wishes on the firm and congrats there Kathy also.\nGary Fayard: Thank you \nDara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley: And Muhtar, I was hoping to discuss if your expectations have changed at all here over the last year just regarding the long-term growth potential of the sparkling category. So not necessarily from a market share front but more just in terms of category growth and if one looks at industry data, it looks like sparkling trend slowed more in 2013 than we\u2019ve seen in other CPG categories. So, I was just hoping for some perspective on that, the drivers behind it and expectations going forward?\nMuhtar Kent: Yeah, no changes as far as my perspective is concerned. I can confirm that both, our entire team and as well as our bottling partners feel the same way as the system. We are blessed to be in a great business, both in the sparkling area as well as in the stills. We continue to innovate. I believe that we have a great future where so many -- hundreds of millions of people in so many large markets haven\u2019t tasted a Coca-Cola in the last month or in the last six months or in the last year. We have tremendous opportunity going forward and I believe that through innovation, packaging, equipment and great marketing, we will continue to grow our business going forward both in sparkling and in stills. And I feel confident that we will go back into the corridors of our long-term growth algorithm this year and years to follow. And with new innovations like creating new paths to consumptions, creating new consumption occasions like the Keurig Green Mountain innovation, like Freestyle that is driving, we know everywhere, every time it\u2019s actually installed in an outlet it drives traffic, it drives incidents, it drives increased sales and it drives excitement for the consumer. And at the same time, our contour packages, you will see us being focused much more on the contour. Next year is the 100th anniversary of the contour bottle, the iconic contour bottle. You\u2019ll see a lot of activity around that also. But we feel, we have a lot of work to do, so we feel that isn\u2019t that a great place where you have a lot of work to do and you believe in your future.\nDara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And on the innovation front in the U.S., can you give us a bit more detail in terms of maybe potential timing of sweetener innovation and how impactful you think natural sweeteners could be to your topline results eventually?\nMuhtar Kent: I think they will. I\u2019m certain innovation is going to be impactful and I can\u2019t give you any more details on the timing.\nDara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thanks.\nMuhtar Kent: Yeah. Sure. So, just thank you again, Gary, Kathy, Ahmet, Sandy, Irial, Jackson. We\u2019re just once again, firmly committed to advancing our growth trajectory in 2014. Our strategic priorities are yielding tangible and measurable results and they are consistent with our long-term goals and our overarching business strategy. Increased marketing investments and a focus, a relentless focus on execution underscore the confidence we have in our systems alignment as we seek to execute these strategies, while we further strengthen the foundation for profitable and sustainable long-term growth. Our 2020 Vision calls for a well balanced growth, that is growth in sparkling beverages and also growth in still beverages across more than 200 markets countries and in revenues and margins. And thanks to this balanced growth in both portfolio as well as geographic mix, we see a path that leads to global volume, revenue and profit growth in line with our long-term target. Our focus is unwavering and our execution of our five strategic priorities is going to enable us to restore momentum to growth to our business.

Now, let me turn the call over to Muhtar.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In late 2014, we announced a clear five point plan to reinvigorate our growth and increase profitability. We committed to transform the company to one that is focused on our core value creation model of building strong brands, enhancing customer relationships, and leading our franchise system with a goal of becoming a leaner, higher margin, higher return and more focused company. And I'm pleased to say that we made significant progress against our initiatives, including the very important announcement this morning about accelerating our refranchising. Importantly, our progress against these initiatives is leading to improving performance, even in a very challenging macro environment. Let's start with our key announcements today. One of our five strategic initiatives has been to refocus on our core business of building brands and leading our system of bottling partners. As part of this, we've continued to advance our global refranchising initiatives. With the success of our efforts in Europe and North America, we have the confidence to accelerate our plans. In North America, we learned a significant amount from our initial territory transition efforts. Including the additional territories announced this morning, to-date, we have signed agreements or transferred territories representing over 40% of U.S. bottle can volume. At the same time, the performance of our North America businesses continue to improve throughout this process, delivering the highest revenue growth in three years, while we executed this important transformation. Based on our success and the knowledge we gained through the transitions, we're now ready to accelerate the pace. Today, we announced we are committed to refranchising 100% of our bottling territories, including Coke cold-fill production by the end of 2017. This is a critical step for our entire system in North America. It will not be easy and will require the hard work and dedicated efforts of our entire team and close collaboration with our bottling partners. So we have a clear plan in place, and are confident that this is essential for our future success. Moving on to China, our bottling system in this dynamic country has evolved to the point where refranchising is the next logical step. Today, we are the bottler for roughly one-third of our dynamic China business. We have now entered into a non-binding letter of intent to refranchise our bottling operations to our existing partners, COFCO and Swire. These bottlers have been excellent partners, demonstrating their willingness and capability to grow the China business for the long-term. Therefore, we believe they are ready to take on additional territory and look forward to strengthening our partnerships with them. These new announcements, combined with the pending creation of Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, as well as our investment in our Indonesian bottler, will strengthen our global bottling system for the coming decades. To put it in perspective, adjusting for these transactions, the percent of our 2015 volume sold through company-owned bottlers would have decreased from 18% to 3%. None of this would have been possible without the continuous investment and hard work of our Bottling Investments Group. When we are finished, our Bottling Investments Group will be smaller, more focused, but will remain a critical strategic growth enabler for our company. Taking a step back, I'm proud of the progress we've made over the past 18 months and look forward to completing the next critical phase of our journey. When we complete these refranchising efforts by the end of 2017, we will look very different than we do today, as we return to a company that is focused on our core strength of building strong, sustainable and valuable brands, creating value for our customers and partners and continuing to drive system capabilities. As a result, we will become less capital intensive, with significantly higher margins and returns, which will enable our core strengths even further. Another of our five strategic initiatives is targeting disciplined brand and growth investments. While much of this discussion has been about increasing the quantity of our marketing, we know that improving the quality of our marketing is just as critical for success. That is why I am particularly pleased by Coca-Cola's new global marketing campaign. Actually, this is not just a new global campaign, but a new business approach. While we've added a lot of choices to the trademark Coca-Cola portfolio over the years, drinks with calories, without calories, with caffeine or without, this is our first campaign ever to cover all the refreshing brands within our Coca-Cola trademark portfolio. As the most valuable beverage brand in the world, people continue to love our brand, but we recognize consumers want to enjoy Coca-Cola in different ways. Regardless of which one they want, they want a Coca-Cola brand with great taste and uplifting refreshment. Our One Brand strategy transitions us to a single iconic brand campaign that celebrates both the product as well as the brand. Importantly, this campaign gets back to our roots, featuring the product at the heart of the creative, and celebrating the experience and simple pleasures of drinking a Coca-Cola, any Coca-Cola. This campaign is also an example of how we are transforming the way we work to be faster with reduced costs. This campaign was built end-to-end from the start, from consumer through to shopper, digital, and music, and was developed to support the entire globe. This helped us reduce the number of agencies and better leverages production costs as well. This discipline, combined with the inspiration of our talented marketing teams, is what will continue to fuel our growth. While trademark Coca-Cola is the oxygen for our company, we have the leading portfolio of strong valuable brands across multiple categories. And this portfolio continues to grow with 20 $1 billion brands and a strong pipeline of growing regional brands. This year, we gained global value share across the core sparkling packaged water, juice, and juice drinks, energy drinks and ready-to-drink tea categories. In addition to internal innovation, we look externally for bolt-on opportunities to expand our still beverage portfolio and capabilities. Just last week, we announced an investment in Chi Limited, Nigeria's leading value-added dairy and juice company. This adds to our other recent investments, including Monster, Suja, and fairlife, expanding our presence in the energy juice and value-added dairy categories. Last quarter, we also announced our intention to sell our shares in conjunction with JAB Holdings' pending acquisition of Keurig Green Mountain. We will recover our initial investment when that transaction closes, while continuing to drive our Keurig KOLD opportunity in the marketplace. In summary, we recognize we still have much work to do, but we have a clear plan, clear path to transform the company, becoming more focused on our core business of building brands and leading our system of bottling partners, thereby giving us even greater confidence to achieve our long-term growth targets. I will now hand the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, James Quincey, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our operating performance in 2015.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Thank you, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. So, as Muhtar mentioned, let me spend a few minutes reviewing our 2015 operational performance, before handing the call over to Kathy. In 2015, we delivered our plan for our transition year, despite challenging macroeconomic environments. We gained value share in NARTD, sparkling and still beverages, an important metric for us as we manage the business, especially during periods of slower economic growth and volatility. For the full year, organic growth of revenues was 4% and, importantly, we delivered 2% global price/mix. This was stronger price realization than we have generated in several years, reflecting our segmented revenue growth management strategies and enabled by our increased investments in media. Unit case volume grew 2% for the year. We're pleased with this volume performance, given our focus on improving price realization during a time when consumer spending was pressured in many markets. And I'm also pleased to confirm that globally, we captured over $600 million in productivity, ahead of the target we set for ourselves at the beginning of the year. So structurally-adjusted, comparable currency neutral income before tax grew 6% for the year, as we benefited from the productivity efforts and favorable commodities, although partially offset by our increased media investments. During the year, we saw a slowing environment in China and challenges in several key emerging markets, including Brazil and Russia. This was offset by solid performance in North America and many of our Latin American markets. North America itself delivered its strongest performance in three years, delivering 4% organic revenue growth, with three points of price realization, supported by our increased marketing effort and a disciplined approach to volume, price and mix management. Consistent with this strategic focus, our driving of consumption small packages could be seen across North America. We grew purchase transactions 3%, outpacing the 1% unit case volume growth, as consumers increasingly reached for the mini cans, the smaller PET, the 8-ounce glass bottles, as well as our premium aluminum bottles, all of which drive more value per occasion than our traditional packages. Hopefully, many of you also saw an example of this strategic focus on Sunday night during the Super Bowl, when we aired our latest commercial focusing exclusively on the mini can package. Our performance in 2015 gives us confidence that our strategies are working and that our underlying performance will be within our long-term targets in 2016. However, let me be clear. The global economy remains challenged and is not improving rapidly. We do see slightly better GDP growth rates for 2016 as compared to 2015. But to be fair, forecasts continue to be revised downwards and there is still much uncertainty. Notable are Brazil and Russia continuing to deteriorate, while China's growth rate does also slow, putting pressure across many of the emerging and developing markets. Now, while helpful to consumers, the lower price of oil is also causing volatility in the Middle East and other oil-driven export economies, with further implications for those nations. So, given the erratic nature of the global economy, we will continue to focus on what we can control in order to deliver our plan. We will continue to build on the fundamentals of our strategy for long-term success, while delivering solid revenue growth and strong, underlying operating margin expansion, through the expected continued management of our portfolio, price/mix and productivity efforts. With that, I'm going to hand off to Kathy, who will give you additional details on North American productivity programs, and walk through the 2016 outlook.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In the interest of time this morning, I intend to cover just three topics: North America refranchising; our updated productivity targets; and our outlook for 2016. Let me start with our refranchising efforts in North America. As we accelerate our refranchisings, we are returning to our core business of brand building, driving customer value and leading the system. At the same time, the refranchising causes a lot of complexity in our North America P&L. Therefore, in order for management to view the underlying performance of our core business in North America separately, we made the decision to adjust our operating segments such that, starting in 2016, CCR will be reported within our Bottling Investments Group. Going forward, the vast majority of any structural impacts to our business will now be reported within a single operating segment. We believe this will also be helpful to our investors for the same reason of assessing the continued underlying performance of our core business. We understand that the accelerated refranchising, coupled with the shift in reporting segments, will likely result in a lot of modeling questions. So we will provide revised operating segment financial information reflecting this change before the end of the quarter. With regards to modeling, we are providing detailed structural guidance for 2016, the majority of which is related to the North America refranchising efforts. The remainder of the territories will transfer by the end of 2017, but the P&L impact will depend on the timing of transfers. We will share more with you at the appropriate time on the expected impact in 2017. As we transition territories, we are committed to eliminating the temporary residual costs we have referenced in the past as quickly as possible, and we anticipate the majority of these will be removed in 2017. With that said, there could be a portion of residual costs remaining in 2018 as we wind down the final support of these operations, but this amount would be relatively small and would be eliminated by the end of 2018. Our productivity program is also evolving due to the accelerated refranchising. Approximately half of our $3 billion productivity program was expected to come from supply chain savings. And a significant portion of those savings were expected to come from North America, due to the size and finished goods nature of the business. Now that we are accelerating our refranchising, we will no longer be able to capture a portion of the identified supply chain savings prior to divestiture. However, we have built a disciplined process and capabilities that have allowed us to exceed our goals to-date, and identify incremental opportunities within cost of goods sold, operating expenses and marketing to replace the supply chain savings being refranchised, thus enabling us to maintain our $3 billion target. As we've communicated to you in the past, we said we would continue to look at every layer of spending as we move through the productivity work and we have done just that. Coupled with the success we've seen so far, we have the confidence to effectively raise our level of targeted savings across our remaining spend base. With the incremental savings identified in our core business and the fact that our addressable cost base will substantially reduce post-2017, it should be even more evident that our $3 billion program represents a sizable opportunity. We look forward to providing further details at CAGNY next week. Turning to outlook, despite challenging macro environments in many key markets around the world, our focus on revenue and disciplined brand investments continues to improve our top-line growth. Also, we are seeing productivity flow through our P&L. While much of this was obscured by currency and structural changes, we saw solid underlying margin expansion last year, even while we grew marketing expenses at a faster rate than gross profits. For those reasons, in 2016, we expect to be back on our long-term growth algorithm prior to any structural changes, which are primarily driven by our accelerated pace of refranchising. Organic revenue is expected to grow 4% to 5%, in line with our long-term target, as our marketing investments continue to pay off. Given the current macro environment and lapping better comps in 2015, we believe this is a solid target. We expect the commodity environment to be benign, but considering that we hedge our exposure to many commodities, we may not see the full benefit you would expect when looking at today's spot prices. Given the general weak macroeconomic environment and the associated pressure on top-line growth, we are focused on capturing more than $600 million of productivity in order to deliver our profit targets. We will do this even as we continue to increase the investments in media behind our brands and step up R&D investments in 2016. Finally, we anticipate interest cost to increase in 2016 due to higher interest rates, as well as our decision to shift some of our debt from commercial paper to longer-term maturities that carry slightly higher interest rates. After considering all of these factors, we expect comparable currency neutral income before tax, structurally-adjusted, to grow 6% to 8% in 2016, in line with our long-term targets, as strong operating profit growth is partially offset by net interest expense. As Muhtar mentioned earlier, there will be significant structural impacts to our business as we accelerate our refranchising efforts in North America, complete the mergers of Coca-Cola European Partners, and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, and cycle a half-year impact from the Monster Beverage transaction, which closed in mid-2015. We currently expect both Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa to close during the second quarter. Taken together, we expect the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures to be a four to five point headwind to net revenue. Because of the nature of the structural changes, we also anticipate that the impact will be slightly higher on cost of goods sold and SG&A. We expect the benefit to equity income from Monster, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa and Coca-Cola European Partners to partially offset that impact at operating income, resulting in a three to four point negative structural impact to income before tax. Our underlying effective tax rate is expected to remain at 22.5% for 2016. Finally, we expect approximately $2 billion to $2.5 billion in net share repurchases for 2016. We therefore expect comparable currency neutral EPS growth of 4% to 6%, inclusive of the three to four point structural headwind to income before tax. As you well know, many of the world's currencies have continued to depreciate versus the U.S. dollar. Since we operate in over 200 markets, we are not immune to this effect. In addition, we will be cycling the Euro debt re-measurement gain we recorded in Other Income during the first two quarters of 2015. Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we expect a four point headwind to net revenue and a nine point headwind to income before tax. However, the currency headwind to operating income will be lower as we cycle the gain I just mentioned. In terms of coverage, we are fully hedged on the euro, yen and sterling for 2016. We also have near-term coverage in place across several other major currencies. Finally, we expect to spend $2.5 billion to $3 billion on CapEx, as we continue to maintain our facilities in advance of transitioning territories and production assets. By the end of 2017, our capital needs will decrease significantly, as we refranchise healthy businesses in North America and China. As you model the first quarter, please remember that due to our reporting calendar cycle, there will be one less day in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015. Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we expect that currency will be a five point headwind on net revenues and a 12 point headwind on income before tax in the first quarter of 2016. We expect the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures to be a slight headwind on net revenue and structural items to be a two point headwind on income before tax. In summary, our financial performance for 2015 was slightly better than our expectations, and we executed our five point plan effectively. And we are already working diligently to deliver our commitments for 2016. We continue to focus on our core capabilities of building brands, driving customer value and leading the system, so that when we complete our refranchising, we will be a lower risk, higher return business with even greater confidence to achieve our long-term growth targets. We look forward to sharing more with you at CAGNY. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nWilliam G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, good morning.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Morning.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Morning, Bill.\nWilliam G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I'm great. How are you?\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Great. Thanks.\nWilliam G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, can you just talk about why now is the right time to pull all this stuff forward on the refranchising front because, obviously, there's like a ton of macro volatility? I know there was some challenges as you kind of wanted to standardize the IT platform and then even some of the key account stuff, which I thought had a little bit of a longer tail. So any thoughts you have on that would be appreciated.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Thanks, Bill. Ever since I took over as CEO, I have always emphasized the importance of our franchise model. And one of my clear priorities was to accelerate growth in our biggest profit pool, the United States. And we bought the business of CCE, U.S. operations with that goal in mind. So when you think about it now, we've been able to prove to ourselves that we can accelerate the business in North America. We've had the best year in 2015, and you saw the results from the quarter. And these results show that our strategic focus on driving consumption of smaller package sizes is continuing to pay off. Transactions are growing. Price/mix is healthy. And so we're bringing those two things together, both the goal of going back, returning to our core model, which we've always emphasized, even the first time we announced the purchase of CCE's U.S. operations, we said there will be a role for partnerships going forward as soon as we can put some things right. We have got the three legs of the stool in place, the customer governance, production governance, and the IT platforms. And so we feel very confident. We have proven to ourselves that we can do it and we feel very confident that this is the time. The new model is established. Bottler performance is improving. We have a new structure to last us the next number of decades. And we're putting our bottlers in the right hands. As Kathy said, the bottlers are very healthy and thanks to the great leadership and capability of our Bottling Investments Group. And so, yes, we are now going to the core and this is the time. And we feel very confident that we can do the two things together, accelerate momentum and bring the franchising to a bookend that really, we feel, is going to be very beneficial both to our company, our shareowners, as well as to leading to better customer service and better value creation on the bottler side. So it's really a win-win from all those perspectives, Bill.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nBonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Morning, Bonnie.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Morning.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Morning, Bonnie.\nBonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I was hoping you could actually give us a concrete example that gave you the confidence to make the decision to accelerate your refranchising plans. And then, while your margin should certainly expand and your returns will increase, could you help frame for us the incremental dilution expected from the new system? And then finally, I'd like to hear what your plans are for the cash you'll receive from the planned sale of the 39 production facilities, which I guess, I assume should raise a fair amount of cash, considering I think the earlier sales, the nine sites, had a book value of $280 million, if I'm not mistaken.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure, Bonnie. I'll say a few words and then I'll let Kathy and James comment, too. But I'll say that certainly, we have the proof points in the United States. Our Chinese business, for example, also has great momentum, gaining share and growing in that difficult environment, if you look at the quarter, if you look at the full year results. And the capability that has been put into place in all our expanding bottlers, everywhere, is really giving us the confidence. And also just look at the momentum of the business. Our revenue growth was a priority. We got it up to the 4% to 5% range. And the increased marketing is working, clearly, and now better marketing was even going to enhance that. And at the same time, we feel that every time the territory has transitioned, it's actually continued to do well, continued to gain share, continued to drive momentum, continued to drive incremental transactions. And from that, any of the territories in the last four, five quarters that have been transitioned, we have seen, without exception, that to be holding true. And if you look at all these bottlers that we're refranchising, look at the results. Look at the performance of our German bottler. It really has the greatest momentum in the continent of Europe right now. So all of these bottlers are going in to a system, to a structure, to an architecture, to a geography that will continue to do even better when you combine it and when you create the synergies with the combination. And so, we feel confident. And then, what took a little while to get right was the governance model around production in the United States, the governance model around the IT platform, the governance model around the customer service. All of those are in place and working well. So, I'll just hand over to James to add some flavor to that in more details, and then Kathy can comment also on your questions related to the financial aspect of cash.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, Bonnie, let me just add one thought to what Muhtar has laid out there on we've been fixing and building. And we're finding the right partners. I mean, a simple way of looking at why it's working is there's just more people coming to the table saying, we want to be partners. Our existing partners want more territories. And new people who aren't in the system want to get into the system. So they're seeing that we've fixed the business and we've built momentum. And so, there's a lot of heightened interest in being part of a growing Coke system, particularly in North America.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay. Then, Bonnie, I think the next part of your question, you asked about the incremental dilution and the impact of that. I can help you with the impact of that. So for 2016, we gave you the impact. And then for 2017, we are doing several things, because we know you all have lots of questions about 2017. So we are going to provide revised operating segment financial information later in the quarter. And then at CAGNY, we're going to give you a look at kind of what to anticipate the business will look like after everything is finished in 2018, because the actual dilution kind of depends really on the timing of these transactions.\nBonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And so the best way we can give you some indication of that is really to kind of help you understand what our business will look like when everything is said and done in 2018 and beyond, which is what we're going to try to do at CAGNY. So I would ask you just hold off on that, and more to come on that. And then on the question about cash, so the cash will basically go into basically our capital structure and be part of just our normal mix. And at this point, no board level decisions have been made, so we anticipate that these proceeds will be used to strengthen our balance sheet.\nBonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: All right. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Morning.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, Muhtar, you've posted a couple quarters in a row with volume growth back up in the 3% range, along with solid pricing, despite the difficult emerging markets macro environment we're seeing. So, I just wanted to get an update on your market share performance. Obviously, you're gaining share, but have you seen a relative change in terms of incremental market share performance and what level of payback you're getting on the higher marketing? And as you look out to 2016, 4% to 5% organic sales growth is a fairly tight range. So how much visibility do you think you have around that? Could macros pose a risk to that guidance, particularly given you're assuming higher GDP growth? Thanks.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Dara. As I mentioned, we're pleased with our market share performance, value share gains across the world, and I'll let James highlight some details on that.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah. Thanks, Muhtar. So, Dara, let me just give you a quick run round the world, in terms of share. I mean, firstly, on an overall global basis, perhaps consistent with our strong fourth quarter, we gained a little more share in the fourth quarter than we had in the whole year, so a better performance at the tail end. And in terms of how that played out across the world, you see, again, in line with the volume performance, strong results in North America. We gained share in sparkling. We gained share in stills, and we gained share overall in the quarter and in the year, so good momentum in North America coming through in share. In Europe, we're gaining share in sparkling and in stills. Given our different starting points, that's netting out to kind of being flat overall, but we got a strong growth in Europe as we build our stills business. Latin America, this is a long-term track record of success, so small gains there, building on a long history of building a great position. Eurasia, despite some of the volatility in that part of the world, we gained share in both sparkling and stills and overall, pretty strong momentum there, in terms of share. And then in Asia Pacific, we've focused more on re-staging and re-energizing the sparkling business, where we're gaining share. We lost a little bit in stills and overall flat. So I think wherever you look round the world, we're largely flat to gaining. And so, and consistent with our volume growth, which is broad-based and across the world, we're also largely winning across the world. So in terms of \u2013 which one do you want me to do, marketing payback? So I think what you're seeing is, there is results from the marketing payback. I mean, our organic revenue growth in 2015 was better than 2014. We're guiding for a good number that's ahead of 2015, in 2016. So, we see the marketing payout beginning to build the momentum globally. And I think if you doubled-down on that one and look under that, North America was one of the first places we started with the incremental marketing and that's self-evidently building momentum. So, we see the underlying business results coming through in revenue, very much tied to where the extra media money is going. And then in terms of macro outlook and risk to top-line, I think we feel that we got underlying structural momentum in the business. Now, when I said we're planning on the macros slightly better in 2016, and I really do mean slightly, and I wouldn't be surprised if that was the same growth rate in 2015, but we think we have the right portfolio and the right optionality to be able to deliver our financial numbers in that environment.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then, if I could just slip a detail question in, Kathy, I was hoping you could give us clarity on the impact to 2017 earnings from FX, if spot rates stay at this level, given the hedging in 2016, and how much hedging you have in place for 2017 on some of the hard currencies.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay. So, for 2017, Dara, we are also fully hedged on our major currencies. So, obviously, the emerging market currencies are the ones where you can't really hedge more than a quarter or so out. So, obviously, we have done nothing on the emerging market currencies. But on the hard currencies, we are hedged at rates slightly worse than in 2016. So there will be a slight impact, but I wouldn't think it would be terribly significant.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from John Faucher of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJohn A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Two questions here; first off, it's a little tough with all the refranchising of the bottlers to get a handle in terms of what's truly going on on the gross margin. So, can you try and strip some of the impact out from the refranchising and give us an idea what the underlying gross margin is doing? And then, Kathy, going back to your points on the balance sheet, can you just sort of talk about what you're seeing out there that's causing you to maybe term-out some of the longer term debt? Is it just sort of the short market volatility, or is this something where you would expect to maybe go with a more conservative balance sheet approach on a go-forward basis? Thanks.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure, John. So the gross margins in fourth quarter impacted by the six fewer days, and the currency and then the structural impact. So, if you take all of that out, basically, we had good gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter and for the full year. What was the second question? So, the balance sheet, basically, as we've got so much cash that's outside of the United States, we are taking a little bit more of a conservative approach with our balance sheet. And it was just more prudent to manage with the longer-term maturities than with short-term maturities. So, we still have a robust portfolio of commercial paper. So we're just kind of balancing that out differently.\nJohn A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, and if I can ask one quick follow-up on that, in terms of the interest income line and some of the cash balances overseas, any change in that approach, or is this mostly going to be on the interest expense line?\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Basically, it's going to be on the interest expense line. Yeah.\nJohn A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think we're expecting much more interest expense, given the rate changes. But also, the longer-term maturities are also causing more interest expense.\nJohn A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. Thanks.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Cooper of Consumer Edge Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nBrett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC: Good morning. One of your stated strategies was to improve the balance of price/mix and volume in your developed markets, and we've clearly seen that in the U.S. But I was hoping you could walk around the world and offer us what you're seeing in other developed markets, provide us with your prospects and confidence for improving price/mix in other developed markets around the world going forward. Thanks.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Brett. I think, if you look at our overall for the whole year, and as well as for the quarter, our price/mix globally, you can see that that has improved. As was mentioned, part of the reason for that is we're beginning to see the results of the increased marketing play through as well as our packaging strategies and mix management. And coupled with that, the value share gains, which is even more pleasing, given that we're able to get healthy pricing in our business and in our markets around the world, but I'll let James comment in terms of Europe and Japan and what is being seen in some of the other developed markets in addition to the United States, okay?\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, thanks, Muhtar. I think firstly, it's important to remember, starting with Europe, that our price positioning in Europe, we have, over time, substantially taken a lot of rate and mix in Europe, such that we are more premium priced compared to our competitors than we are in North America, so less runway in that sense. Now, having said that, we continue to focus on smaller packages, more premium offerings in terms of the brand portfolio, such that despite what is a pretty deflationary retail environment in a number of Western European markets, we're getting price/mix in Europe, both in the quarter and for the full year. So I think going out, one should not expect the same sort of levels the U.S. has been able to develop, especially given the macro environment in Europe at the moment. In terms of Japan, we're very focused on rebuilding our ability to get positive price/mix in Japan. We've recently been able to get some, again, very focused on leveraging both packaging options and the brand portfolio to reshape it to allow us to drive positive mix. Again, I don't think you will see, in Japan, the same sorts of levels as the U.S., as much as anything to do with the deflationary pressures in Japan. But we are starting to see chances of a better pricing environment in Japan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Morning, Bryan.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Morning.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just wanted to get a couple of points of color on the productivity program. I guess, Kathy, to start, you're keeping the original $3 billion plan, but a portion of the COGS opportunity is now going to go off with the refranchising, so could you just give us some sort of idea of just how big that is, how much you had to sort of make up in terms of keeping the $3 billion where it is?\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Certainly. So we will lose about $500 million of productivity, primarily out of cost of goods sold. But, again, we committed to making up that lost amount and we're going to make it up between cost of goods sold, operating expenses, and DME.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And so net, this productivity plan is actually now a little bit bigger than it originally would have been. Is that just a function of as you're doing more, you're finding more savings, or was the refranchising kind of motivating you to look for more savings, just trying to get a sense if there's more momentum building on the productivity program itself?\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, we always said we were going to continue to look for additional productivity opportunities, and so we have done just that. And we've learned a lot about our costs as we have continued the programs, the ZBW as well as other cost optimization programs. So basically, we've looked end-to-end and we saw additional opportunity and we're going to take it.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then just last one, of that $500 million that essentially goes off in refranchising, will that actually still be realized within the franchise system? So does the Coke system itself still see the $500 million of savings, or is that kind of lost because it needed to be sort of integrated with Coke to get it?\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No, it will be captured by the system.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We've been hoping that they can find additional areas, Bryan, to even increase that going forward. Part of the whole plan around the production governance is also to ensure that we can actually lever and pull more synergies out of our production system in the entire sort of template of North America production. So, yes, the answer is a definite yes.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. So from a systems perspective, this is truly incremental savings. It's just a matter of where we're seeing it.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: That's right.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Correct.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nKevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Morning.\nKevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: I wanted to come back to the Asia Pacific region. I have two questions. First is on price/mix, and then second on China specifically. So price/mix in the quarter was down 9%, and margins were down pretty significantly. James, I think you talked about re-staging the sparkling business, and I know there's been some negative geographic mix, so a little bit more color there would be helpful. And then the second piece on China, 1% volume growth, but you were cycling a pretty soft compare of down 1% last year. Maybe you could just elaborate a bit on what you're seeing in that market and your expectation here over the next 12 months. Thanks.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Sure. A, let me start with the price/mix in Asia Pacific. I think the most important thing to note here is because the different geographies in the Asia Pacific group have some quite different pricing and concentrate shipments can be lumpy, you do get some erratic price/mix numbers on a quarterly basis. And that's exactly what you're seeing in the fourth quarter in Asia Pacific. So there were more shipments to somewhere like India than Japan. You can actually see the flip side of this in the Eurasia group, where we got very strong price/mix in the fourth quarter, which was the flip side. We had more shipments to places like South Africa than the Middle East. So this is all about country mix. I think it's important for particularly those two groups, Asia Pacific and Eurasia, to look at some longer-term four quarter trend line on price/mix, given the very impactful country mix issue and the lumpiness of concentrate shipments. So that's the key thing there. And then in terms of China, clearly not as much as we would have liked to have grown in China in the first quarter; I think that the environment in China is pretty clearly having slowed down, but we think we had a strong momentum over the last couple of years coming back into China. We're looking to do better in 2016, but we don't actually provide country-based forecasts. What I would say, however, is we're continuing to do very strongly in terms of share, particularly in sparkling, as we've re-energized that business.\nKevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Powers from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nStephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you very much. So actually a relatively quick set of questions for each of you, if I could; first, Muhtar, on refranchising and the decision to retain hot-fill and juice assets, is that an indefinite plan or is that subject to further review? And similarly, thinking about China and the rest of the world, should we be thinking differently about your plans in India in terms of future refranchising in that market as well? And then, Kathy, the 4% to 5% organic growth you're calling out for next year, can you just give us maybe a rough sense of volume versus price within that and how much, if any, you expect to spend incrementally on A&P in order to achieve what amounts to underlying acceleration? And then finally, James, sorry for all the questions, we debated this a little while back, and I'm just wondering if you've got additional thoughts in terms of your longer-term growth, how much you expect the portfolio to lean on stills versus sparkling, and do you think you have the right balance of demand building support against each of that in order to achieve your long-term goals? Thank you.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Steve, so related to juice and hot-fill and stills, stills continues to perform very well in North America for us and the template for stills production is completely different in terms of how it is configured to cold-fill. And juice is an integrated business. So given those aspects, we intend that for the future to not change the structure related to both hot-fill as well as to juice and our foodservice business. All will remain as integrated in that respect, and they're doing very well. And we feel that they add value to the overall structure of North America, and they're an important strategic part of how we move forward and continue to increase momentum in North America. India, look, you saw that number. Given all these changes we're announcing, basically, if you brought it back to 2015, the total bottling assets that we would have under our management and on our balance sheet would actually go down from 18% of the total mix globally to about 3%. So, yes, in India, there are opportunities in other parts of the world remaining, but it's a very small template based on where we are, and we'll look at opportunities. As James said earlier, one of the litmus tests \u2013 I've always said, one of the great sort of litmus tests for the health of the Coca-Cola business is the desire of investors and our franchise partners to have more territory. That's at an all-time high, and we expect that to remain high. And therefore, there may be other opportunities in the remaining geographies, but I can't comment on that any further right now. And then I'll pass it over to James to take you through the longer-term question on portfolio stills versus sparkling, and then Kathy, the question on 4%, 5% organic growth, volume versus price. So James?\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Sure. Look, I think our aspiration is to have both of them growing, both bottling and stills, and that's what we achieved in the fourth quarter and in the full year of 2015. Now, I think in a total portfolio sense, much as in the same way has happened over the last decade or so, we've gone from about 10% of the portfolio being stills to roughly 25% of the portfolio being stills. I think mathematically, the stills will grow as a percent of the total portfolio. And I would note, as Muhtar commented earlier, I think we need to break out the stills and not just look at them as one thing, but look at them in terms of their individual categories. And we gained share in packaged water. We gained share in juice and juice drinks. We gained share in energy, and we gained share in ready-to-drink tea. So we think we can do well in each of the categories that represent non-alcoholic ready-to-drink. And in particular, we can still grow sparkling. And that growth of sparkling into the future is not just in aggregate, but I think over the long-term, we'll see increased growth of low, no and reduced calorie variants. I know that's not the case yet in the North America, but globally in our international business, those drinks outgrow the regular drinks within sparkling and they're fueling our growth, so broad-based growth.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay. Then on your question of 4% to 5% organic growth, volume versus price/mix, so we expect that to be balanced, volume versus the price. So as you know, we have the strategy where we now focused more on net revenues. And as we are segmenting our markets and we're focused on price realization, so we do anticipate that strategy will continue and that will achieve a balance between both volume and price. As advertising and promotions, in 2014, we announced this program. We said $800 million to $1 billion that we would invest. We are still going to invest, continue to invest behind our brands on that program, although we're also going to start investing in R&D. So basically, we're still on our program that we announced back in 2014, so you will continue to see investment in marketing kind of slightly above gross profits.\nStephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. So on refranchisement, obviously, good news that it's going faster, but I still have a few questions on this. One is I get the discussion about holding onto juice. I'm not quite there on hot-fill, so if you can elaborate on that, that would be helpful. Trying to get a better sense, secondarily, about when you think you will actually be able to grow out of the dilution. So there's clearly dilution right now, and then 2016, 3% to 4%, and then probably 2017, but at what point will you be able to grow out of that dilution, given kind of better margin, top-line growth, et cetera? And then kind of the core question is that you mentioned your goal was by buying the North America Bottling, that you would be able to accelerate momentum for sales and profitability. And I agree you've kind of done that, going to smaller pack sizes, increasing prices, closing some plants, increasing media spend, improving IT, but I guess I'm still confused why you had to buy one consolidated bottler, I guess, in North America to do a lot of those changes. I mean, why do you have to spend billions of dollars to push these changes through? Was there not a more efficient for shareholders way to do it? And I guess in that context, how do you give investors confidence? Because I get this question a lot, how do you give investors confidence that five, 10 years down the line, you won't have to buy these bottlers back again in North America?\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, Ali, let me start with the last. First, when we announced the acquisition of CCE, it was, essentially, kind of a 25-year-old problem, and we said it would take a while to basically course correct. The level of investment was not where it was needed, and also the level of customer service was not where it was needed. And, essentially, we believe that having more than just one bottler essentially having that big a territory was a better way. Scalable size bottlers, right ownership values, right structure and right capability, and that's what we have today in North America. And so, we feel very good that this is a model that is going to stay where it is and continue to add value. It's not going to require any further \u2013 all of the time, there will be tweaking necessary, but not the scale that was needed when we did the transaction back at the end of 2010. And so, that was a core decision that was needed. That was a major surgery that was needed, and that's really what took place. As far as the juice business is concerned, as I said before, it's an integrated business. It basically performs well as an integrated business, similar to other juice businesses that we have around the world. It's a very different model. It's a very different production. It's a very different \u2013 grove to table model, and requires a different way in terms of its distribution, especially when it is chilled. And that's really where a lot of the growth is and value-added dairy. And that's what you see, whether it's in fairlife, or that's what you see, whether it's in juice. And it's a very distinct production model, very different, as well as hot-fill is also the same, so same with Innocent in Europe, the same with many parts of the world. And so, Jugos Del Valle is also very similar in terms of the way it's produced, and that is just a needed aspect for success and for performance in the hot-fill and juice business, very different. Now, to your other question related to dilution from franchising, maybe I'll pass it over to Kathy.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Certainly. So we've given you guidance for 2016. 2017, it totally depends on timing. So, we plan to give you more information to help with that, with your modeling, between CAGNY, and what we will give you before the end of the quarter, but it's all based on timing. In 2018, you asked when we would grow out of this. We plan to complete the program by the end of 2017. So, 2018, we are out of it.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. And our long-term outlook, just to add, for the industry, remains very positive, Ali. Our system is extremely well-positioned to take advantage of this. We're going to be a much more focused company. We're going to be building brands, leading the system, and driving new growth platforms. So, our core business will have attractive growth going forward, in terms of ROIC, free cash flow and so forth. And so we're very confident and very excited about where the company is going, from that aspect.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So, I apologize. Maybe I wasn't clear on the dilution piece to it. I understand the timing of the program. I'm not looking for timing in terms of when in 2017 something happens. I'm more looking longer-term, and if you're getting rid of these businesses, you will be a better growing business, right, better margin, better growing business? That's the hope. That's, I think all of us, as we're trying to estimate longer-term. I'm just trying to figure out, because you're going to be better, when do you offset the dilution? So you're growing faster, you've taken a hit. When are you going to offset the dilution? At what point in time, effectively, do you become net positive and then go beyond that? So, that was the question. Maybe, Kathy, if you can kind of refine your answer. I'll leave it at that, if you can help there.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So in, basically, so 2018, obviously, there will be some dilution effect because the base hasn't been totally adjusted by that time. But once we get the base adjusted, short of other structural impacts, which will not be North America refranchising obviously, but short of other structural impacts, we will have \"gone through that refranchising impact.\" Now, we do have some residual costs that will come out, as I said, throughout 2016, 2017, and there will be a little bit left in 2018, that certainly by mid to late 2018, even the residual costs will be gone. So I think once the base is reset, short of other types of structural impacts, we will have transitioned through that.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Just one last question, sorry, on diets, it looks like volumes are down 5%, but that's better than we've seen recently. Can you give us some color on whether you're seeing that actually kind of stabilize and perhaps a little bit improve, or is it because Pepsi changed formulation and you guys are kind of getting the benefit of it? Just some idea of whether that's getting better on diets would be helpful. Thank you. That's it for me.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Ali, it's James here. Look, I think in the U.S. business, we did reasonably well in growing Coke Zero. We're getting Coke Zero back to flat, and there's still a decline in Diet Coke. I think the bigger picture is in the 80% of our business which is the international business, the diets and lights and Coke Zeros outgrew Coke Classic, and so we're seeing broad-based growth outside the U.S. of those Coca-Cola variants, and that's what gives us the belief that in the long-term, we will be able to turn around the business also in the U.S.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, just finally add on that, Ali, also with our recently-announced One Brand approach to marketing trademark Coke, we're extending the strong brand equity of Coca-Cola across the trademark to offer consumers more choice and to also better promote our great-tasting diet and light portfolio, which is going to, no question, help. So I think that's going to also help us with the stability that is the target. So I'll just leave it at that.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Muhtar Kent for closing remarks.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, James, Kathy, and Tim. So in summary, we delivered the plan that we laid out at the beginning of last year. And we made significant progress against our five strategic initiatives that we laid out. Importantly, our progress against these initiatives is leading to improving performance, even in a very challenging macro environment. And we are evolving and strengthening our global bottling system as we accelerate refranchising and return to a predominantly cost rate-driven model with significantly higher margins and returns. The long-term dynamics of our industry remain promising, and we absolutely believe that The Coca-Cola Company is best-positioned to capture that growth in non-alcoholic beverages and to deliver long-term value to our shareowners. And, as always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company, and for joining us this morning.\nOperator: Thank you, speakers. That concludes today's conference.

Now, I'll turn the call over to Muhtar.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. 12 months ago, we announced a five-point strategic plan to reignite our performance. Since then, our company has undergone substantial change while navigating a slowing global macroeconomic environment. Before handing the call over to James Quincey, our recently announced President and Chief Operating Officer, to review our third quarter performance results, let me recap the decisive actions we've taken over the past year, as well as highlight why we believe The Coca-Cola Company is well positioned to continue winning in the vibrant non-alcoholic beverage industry. First, we said we would drive revenue and profit growth with clear portfolio roles across our markets. We have and will continue to do so. We segmented our markets to develop long-term revenue growth strategies based on clear volume, price investment and profit expectations, which were built into our 2015 plans and strategies going forward. Importantly, we revised our annual incentive metrics to include revenue growth, and tied them directly to these clear portfolio roles in order to drive the right behavior in each market. Second, we said we would target disciplined brand and growth investments. Last year, we significantly increased our media investments, and we're doing so again this year. Also, under the leadership of Marcos de Quinto, who was named Chief Marketing Officer at the beginning of this year, we've improved the quality of our advertising while rewiring our marketing organization around consumer clusters to drive speed, efficiency and effectiveness, and we're seeing results, with year-to-date value share performance accelerating across several markets. In addition, the incremental marketing is helping to accelerate revenue growth in some of our key markets, including North America. We also made investments in new growth platforms. We closed a transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation to compete more effectively in the global energy category, and just recently, our brands launched on the Keurig KOLD system in the home dispensing platform. In China, we have announced plans to expand into plant-based protein drinks through the acquisition of the beverage business of China Green Culiangwang Beverages Holdings that recently received regulatory approval. And in the United States, we invested in and signed a distribution agreement with Suja, a high growth organic cold-pressed juice company. All these are long-term investments that we believe will allow us to add profitable new transactions in the non-alcoholic beverage industry. Third, we said we would drive efficiency through more aggressive productivity. Our current $3 billion productivity program touches every part of our business and organization, from our operating model to cost of goods sold to marketing expenses. We're driving these savings through a disciplined process that involves our entire leadership team and associates. And ultimately, it's about building a culture that is focused on getting better every single day and challenging every dollar we spend. We're on track against our overall goals, and importantly, have implemented a broad set of changes in 2015 that will help us continue progress into 2016 and beyond. These include the implementation of zero-based work across our entire company as well as our corporate center and operating units, a disciplined program management approach to drive cost of goods sold savings in everything from our formulas to our packaging to our day-to-day operations in our plans. Fourth, we said we would streamline and simplify our organization. To date, we've standardized key processes, linked our business units with our corporate center and eliminated group functional roles in order to speed up decision making and enhance focus at the local level to drive growth. Our previously announced head count reductions are substantially completed, and we are operating within our new structure. Importantly, we are ahead in terms of scope and timing. Finally, we said we would refocus on our core business model of building the world's greatest beverage brands and leading an unmatched global system. And over the past year, we've made substantial progress in evolving and strengthening our bottling landscape. Starting in North America, so far, we have transferred or signed agreements for territories covering over 30% of U.S. bottle can volume. And just recently, we announced the creation of the National Product Supply System in order to align on a clear path forward for our 21st century manufacturing footprint in the United States. In Europe, we announced the creation of Coca-Cola European partners, which will transform the Western European bottling landscape. And looking outside the developed world, we've made critical changes to our bottling system in key emerging markets. At the end of last year, we entered into an agreement to re-architect our African bottling system with the creation of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, which will have the scale, resources and efficiencies to fund the investment required to capture the strong long-term growth potential in Africa. Also, during the first quarter of this year, we invested in our Indonesian bottler to help our system capture the long-term opportunity in this attractive and large emerging market. In short, our company has undergone a significant amount of streamlining and change these past 12 months. And while we are encouraged by our progress, we know we need to do more, which leads me to our most recent change. As we continue to increase our focus on improving global execution, we recently appointed James Quincey to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer. James has a deep knowledge of the global system and solid existing relationships with both bottlers and customers all around the world. He's uniquely qualified to accelerate the company's five strategic initiatives for growth in the months and years ahead. I will now hand the call over to James, who will walk you through our quarterly performance.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Thank you, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. Let me start on this first earnings call by saying that it's a tremendous honor for me to serve as the President and Chief Operating Officer of The Coca-Cola Company. In my 19 years with the company, I've seen our business evolve and grow, while remaining strategically focused on doing the right things to drive long-term sustainable growth. As Muhtar referenced, we are resolutely focused on executing against the five strategic initiatives laid out last year. And a significant part of my role will be ensuring that we deliver. Now, during the quarter, we made two important announcements that provide clarity on the future of our distribution and bottling structures in the United States and in Europe. First, in our flagship market, we announced the creation of the National Product Supply System, or NPSS, to strengthen and streamline U.S. production as part of our effort to refranchise bottling territories in North America. Our approach embodies the best of both worlds by encompassing a national production system that generates efficiencies and scale for our system in combination with regional production that leverages the expertise and local knowledge of our longstanding bottling partners, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Coca-Cola United and Swire Coca-Cola USA. These bottlers will continue to own and operate their own plants and, where applicable, acquire additional production assets from the company-owned Coca-Cola Refreshments. This will provide a clear profit incentive to make the local operations as efficient as possible. However, to ensure the benefits of scale remain, the NPSS will have a governing board with the power to implement measures to ensure the production assets owned by NPSS bottlers are optimally deployed to produce the lowest cost, benefiting the entire system. This board will focus on making decisions on infrastructure planning, innovation planning, and optimal sourcing at the national level. The board will be comprised of representatives from Coca-Cola North America, Coca-Cola Refreshments and the three independent bottlers, which, together, currently represent approximately 95% of the U.S. produced volume. We believe this structure allows us to leverage our significant system scale with a unique competitive advantage of being able to act locally with speed. Together, with our focus on driving revenue, this will result in system margin expansion over the coming years. So in addition to system-wide benefits, this approach has the additional benefit for The Coca-Cola Company in that it accelerates our return to an asset-light model, which will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending and invested capital, and improved return on invested capital for our company as we transition these production assets. We also continue to make progress on the refranchising of the U.S. distribution territories. Just this morning, we announced that we signed non-binding Letters of Intent on additional distribution territories in seven states. As Muhtar referenced, this will bring the total amount of volume in territories transitioned to date, all covered by agreements, to over 30% of U.S. bottle can volume. Also during the quarter, we announced the merger of our company-owned German bottling operations with Coca-Cola Iberian Partners and Coca-Cola Enterprises into a new company named Coca-Cola European Partners. This will transform our Western European bottling landscape and create the world's largest independent Coca-Cola bottler, based on revenue. The creation of a larger unified bottling partner in Western Europe represents an important step in our global systems evolution, as we continue to adapt our business model to innovate, invest, and grow along with the changing demands of the marketplace. This merger enhances alignment within the Coca-Cola system, enabling us to more effectively compete and drive growth across developed European markets. Importantly, the new company will position to deliver world-class execution and customer service by leveraging the best practices of each party to drive sustainable growth in multiple categories. Now, turning to the performance in this quarter, well, the global economic environment remains challenging. As the slowdown in the Chinese economy and the lower oil prices are putting pressure on many commodity-dependent economies such as Australia, Brazil, and Russia, while volatility rippling through the Middle East causes further economic uncertainty. Despite these macroeconomic challenges, our five-point plan and our focus on execution and reinvestment drove improved results, with both unit case volume and price/mix growing 3% each in the quarter, as outlined in our quarterly performance scorecard on slide 11. Organic revenues grew 3%, driven by the previously-mentioned strong price/mix and slight growth in concentrate shipments. Our top line performance was broad based, with five of the six operating segments delivering organic revenue growth. North America continued its disciplined approach to volume, price, and mix management, and I'm encouraged by the solid progress we've seen in this market over the past two years. In Europe, we drove top-line growth through strong commercial and marketing activities whilst also benefiting from some good weather in much of the region. We are seeing green shoots in Europe, and our business in Central and Southern Europe delivered a particularly strong quarter due to investments in media, changes in our price/pack architecture, and favorable weather. In Latin America, we delivered double-digit organic revenue growth despite worsening conditions in Brazil. Our Mexico business unit helped to balance the weakness in Brazil by accelerating unit case volume growth to 4% in the quarter, with growth across all the major categories. In Eurasia and Africa, deteriorating conditions in Russia and volatility in the Middle East partially offset the solid performance in the Africa businesses. Turning finally to the Asia-Pacific group, China and India both grew unit case volume mid-single digits in the quarter. In India, this marks a return to growth for our business after a tough second quarter, with our volume growth trends improving in each month. In China, our consistent strategy and focus on execution led to continued value and volume share gains in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Notably, trademark Coca-Cola reached its highest year-to-date share levels since 2011. In Japan, volume did decline, driven by poor weather in the quarter as well as a move to focus on price realization by reducing discounting on certain low-value multi-serve packs. While this may have short-term consequences in volume and share, it is more important to improve our pricing in the marketplace. Finally, our Bottling Investments group delivered 3% organic revenue growth, led by operations in Germany, India, and Vietnam. As a result, we once again gained global value share in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in the quarter, with gains in both sparkling and still beverages worldwide. In summary, our third quarter performance marks another positive step towards achieving our goal of accelerating top line growth, with the company delivering both solid pricing and unit case volume growth. We are confident in our strategies and execution, and remain on track to deliver against expectations for this year. I will now hand over to Kathy, who will provide you a more detailed look at our financial performance, as well as our outlook on our business for the rest of 2015.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Organic revenue growth was driven by three points of positive price/mix. Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by positive pricing and product mix initiatives across many of our key markets, and benefited from positive geographic mix due to the strong volume growth in our Bottling Investments group. After adjusting for the additional days in the first quarter, year-to-date concentrate shipments were slightly behind unit cases, primarily due to the timing of shipments in the prior year in our Asia-Pacific and Eurasia and Africa groups. For the full year, we continue to expect concentrate shipments to be generally in line with unit cases. Our comparable currency neutral growth margin expanded on a consolidated basis, due to positive pricing, productivity savings, and a slightly lower commodity cost partially offset by structural changes. Positive comparable currency neutral operating leverage was driven primarily by cycling the timing of marketing expenses (19:00), the impact of which we expect to reverse in the fourth quarter, as well as by a continued focus on controlling our operating costs. For the quarter, comparable currency neutral operating income grew 8%. Below the operating line, net interest income was lower versus prior year, resulting in 7% growth in comparable currency neutral income before tax, which included a one point structural headwind. Our third quarter comparable EPS was $0.51, which included a 12-point currency headwind. On a comparable currency neutral basis, our EPS grew 8% in the quarter. Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to non-cash charges related to the announced refranchising of territories in North America. During the first nine months of the year, we generated $6.7 billion in free cash flow, up 6%, primarily due to the efficient management of working capital and the impact of six additional days, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from currency exchange rates, the impact from refranchising territories in North America and the brand transfer agreement with Monster Beverage Corporation. Our focus on improving working capital contributed an incremental $600 million of cash flow for the first nine months of 2015 versus the prior year. We returned $5.6 billion to shareowners in the form of dividends and net share repurchases during the first nine months. Turning to outlook, we are broadly in line with our expectations for the first nine months of the year. With one quarter remaining, we expect our full year comparable currency neutral EPS to grow 5%, in line with our previous expectations. However, due to the strength of the U.S. dollar, we now expect the currency impact to be slightly more unfavorable. After considering our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we now expect an approximate seven-point currency headwind on net revenue, 11-point headwind on operating income, and an eight-point headwind on income before tax for the full year 2015. Therefore, we expect our comparable EPS to decline 3% for the year. Our full year outlook implies that our fourth quarter comparable currency neutral EPS will decline mid- to high-single digits. There are a couple of points to consider when modeling the fourth quarter. As we communicated at the beginning of the year, our fourth quarter will have six fewer selling days this year. Due to the timing of expenses last year, combined with the increase in media investments this year, we expect DME to increase substantially in the fourth quarter. We expect structural items to be a slight headwind on net revenue, and a two-point headwind on both gross profit and income before tax. We currently estimate currency will be a six-point headwind on net revenues, a 12-point headwind on operating income, and a 10-point headwind on income before tax in the fourth quarter as we cycle more favorable rates from the prior year. As a reminder, these impacts are based on current spot rates, and given the volatile currency environment, these amounts are subject to change. In summary, as you heard from Muhtar and James, our financial performance is consistent with what we discussed early in the year, and we continue to execute as we outlined. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. Our first question is from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. You may proceed.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Good morning, Dara.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, Muhtar, it's been a year since you announced the plans to focus on greater pricing in developed markets as well as boost marketing spend starting in 2015. And I was hoping you could just take a step back and give us a more detailed review of your progress on those fronts. How much top-line growth is responding to those efforts relative to your expectations, both in terms of the market share payback from the higher marketing as well as the demand elasticity from higher pricing? And then just in terms of the quarter, on an adjusted basis ex the concentrate lag, it looks like underlying revenue results are returning to your long-term goals with 3% unit case result and 3% price/mix. So, at this point, do you feel comfortable you can generally meet those long-term top line growth goals going forward, ex any timing issues, or with emerging markets macros still decelerating and perhaps easy comps from this quarter, it's a bit too early to call for that? Thanks.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Dara, thanks for the question. What I would say in general overall is yes, we're pleased with the quarter and the progress we're making but lots of more work to do. This is a transition year. When we talked to you about 12 months ago, we outlined to you that with the changes we're going to make that our goal is to get to mid-single digit currency neutral revenue growth for the comparable revenue growth for the company overall. And I think if you look at our progress to date for the first three quarters of the year, we're at sort of the bottom end of that range, the mid-single digit, if you look at where we are in revenue in terms of currency neutral comparable, and what we have posted in this past quarter, in the third quarter, you would see us if you take those numbers that you mentioned in terms of volume growth of 3% and price/mix of 3%, at the top end of that range. So in essence, we're pleased with the progress that we \u2013 what all the five-point strategy and executing it diligently over the last nine months and even starting at the end of last year has brought us to where we are. And so we feel that we've always said that marketing has a lag, the incremental marketing, there's a lag in terms of when we input it and the results that we're getting, but we see that the plan is working. And we certainly see that we're taking a very strategic approach in terms of marketing spend versus optimal levels. Consistent quality investment in media continues to be one of the strongest drivers of our business, enabling us to generate those \u2013 that revenue. We look at each market. How many weeks of consumer engagement there is, the goal over time is to apply the right pressure in the right way to each of our brands and each of the segments that you mentioned, which is developed, developing and emerging. And the system alignment in our bottling system is matching our alignments with investments \u2013 I'm sorry, with capabilities, execution, output development, cooler placement, et cetera. So we're pleased with what we see there. And of course, all of this being said, we have a volatile macroeconomic environment, which obviously is not getting any better anytime soon. We realize that. The global growth for 2015 is projected to be below last year, and even having said that, the disposable income are even lagging the growth rates that are projected. So, yeah. But, in general, that's how I would frame your question and both James and I and Kathy believe that the incremental and better marketing is certainly giving us the results in terms of the top line currency neutral comparable top line growth.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Steve Powers of UBS. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.\nStephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Great, thanks. Good morning.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nStephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: I actually want to talk a little bit more about the National Product Supply System that James detailed. And I guess specifically, maybe Muhtar or James, could you talk more about the governance process there and the makeup of the managing board? As I understand it, there are five voting members, CCR, Coke North America and then the three bottlers Consolidated, United and Swire. And I guess I'm curious as to how you ensure that tough decisions get made in that structure and implemented in that structure. Do you need unanimous consents? Is it majority rules? And if there isn't unanimous consent or support for a given measure, what gives the NPSG the power to enforce successful implementation? Thanks.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Steve. What we said, again, at the beginning of this journey back three years, four years ago, is that we said that we have an intention to create a system in the United States that can benefit from the local empowerment in each of the communities and the markets that have built our business so successful over the last 130 years. The franchise system, the alignment that brings, the value and trust between us and our bottling partners. But at the same time, create the mechanisms, so to speak, the processes, flexible processes in the marketplace whether it be information systems, whether it be the customer management system so that we can speak with one voice to customers coast-to-coast in the United States, and the National Product Supply System. All of those negotiations with our expanding bottlers took some time to achieve. They're all achieved. That's why we're progressing rapidly with our refranchising program, which is working very well because when we have those processes in place, we can refranchise with confidence and speed and have the business continue to generate the results and the growth that we are seeing in revenue, particularly in the United States of America. And the United States non-alcoholic beverage business is healthy. It is growing in revenues and dollars and cents, and that's the really important element that I want to leave with you. But, just to add more color and flavor to the National Product Supply System question that you had in terms of the governance model, I'll ask James to comment further and give you more insights. James?\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah I think, just specifically on governance, it's not going to be around unanimity. It's going to be based on the driving of the business case. Everyone's committed to doing what is economically the most rational answer for the system. Again, this is when it comes to the national issues. It's not necessarily the management of each local plant, which will remain the job of each of the participating bottlers, or CCNA.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Steve, does that address your question?\nStephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Yes, sorry, I was on mute. No, thank you. That does help. But I guess, James, just to follow up. If there is friction on a given issue, right, if there's debate about what is in the best sort of economic interest of the system, what's the tiebreaker? How does the majority view get pushed through?\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: We're not laying out the precise mechanic, but I can tell you that there's not going to be a full consensus required for every decision. It's going to be a large majority, and if they support the economic case, then that's what's going to move forward. So, we're not creating a system that can become blocked. We're creating a system that's going to (31:48) focus on the best economics of the system in North America, and there are mechanisms for that to go forward.\nStephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Great. There are mechanisms in place to break a tie.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Correct.\nStephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. You may proceed.\nJudy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning. I guess I was hoping to get a little bit more color in your performance in Europe this quarter. So, 4% volume growth, certainly an improvement there. You called out some of the factors, the green shoots in Europe. You've got the favorable weather conditions, as well as the marketing spending step-up. So, number one, can you just talk about a little bit more behind, what really drove the volume improvement? How sustainable those improvements are in terms of volume. And then, if you think about price/mix performance in Europe, kind of flattish performance in a more developed market. So, how should we think about that number? How much was that geographic mix, and are you seeing actual price realization in some of the markets, understanding that, obviously, it's a tough deflationary market there.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah Judy, thanks. This is Muhtar. Good morning. Unit cases, as you said, did grow 4% in the quarter in Europe. They were cycling a minus 5% from prior year, and sparkling was up, as well as stills growing faster than sparkling in Western Europe. And then our concentrate sales did trail also the unit cases in Western Europe, as it did for the whole company. And we were pleased with the results. And certainly, again, some early results from the marketing, but more to come, and I'll ask James to add more color to that. James?\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, thanks, Muhtar. As Muhtar referenced, we were cycling a pretty poor quarter from last year. So, I think it was a favorable comparison, and we had strong results from very favorable weather in the Southern and the Central part of Europe. So I wouldn't read too much into the one quarter. I think if you look at the longer term trends, you can see that we're getting some volume growth in the year-to-date, where the price/mix is bouncing around flat. I think it's important to recognize two things as it comes to price/mix in the case of Europe. One is the general deflationary nature of the European market. Retail pricing is 0% to 1% at best, in general. And then secondly, it's worth remembering that the starting point of pricing in Europe is, in comparison to the U.S., higher. So the opportunity is to drive price/mix on a sustained long-term basis. In a sense, we've already captured some of that in Europe, and we will be chasing that in the U.S. So I don't think we'll see the same sort of price/mix over time in Europe, given our starting point.\nJudy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Sir, your line is open. Please proceed.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Kathy, just a question for you. And just thinking about some of the, I guess, the macro drivers of the P&L as we move into the fourth quarter and maybe beyond, into 2016. Other income this quarter was an expense. Is that at all related to the euro bond gain that you had in the first half, and how we think about lapping that next year? FX, the negative effect on operating income, is greater in the fourth quarter than it was in the third quarter. So should we think about FX carrying into 2016? And then, in terms of structural change, I guess with Germany now essentially being contributed to the partnership, or the new entity in Europe, that will be a structural change for next year, but just anything we should be thinking about in terms of changes in the structural change component of modeling, I guess, going into the fourth quarter, and maybe into next year, would be helpful. Thanks.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. Thank you, Bryan. So for foreign exchange for next year, remember, we had said that for our hard currencies, we are hedged and so our real exposure is around our emerging currencies. Now, that being said, we do have to cycle that euro debt bond offering, which impacted the first quarter and second quarter of this year and for the full year, it was about three points benefit to us. So we do have to cycle that next year on top of just a change in the rates and probably a more difficult currency environment going forward. So, we will give more color on currency in February when we give our full year results for 2016 (sic) [2015] (36:52), but our issue is really going to be around the emerging markets where we've \u2013 it's not cost effective to hedge more than about a quarter at a time. And then in terms of the structural impact, yes, Germany will be a structural impact next year. Obviously, we continue with the North America refranchising, so that will still have a significant impact in North America, and there may be some slight impacts from whenever the Africa transaction closes, but the majority of it will be the Germany transaction and the North America refranchising.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you. And just with the Africa JV, do we still expect that that will close before the end of the year, or is there any update on timing there?\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Bryan, this is Muhtar. What I would say is that it's in the regulatory approval process, and that's all I would say right now, and then we expect it to close some time over the next three months to four months. That's what I would say.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ali Dibadj of Bernstein. Your line is open. You may proceed.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Just a few things. One is I was hoping you could set people just more at ease around the closure of the gap in unit case volume to concentrate sales. I'm getting a lot of questions there. And if that \u2013 look, if you're real comfortable with that and if that's the case that that closes for all the regions in the world, it certainly does look like there's an inflection point on top line. But are we now comfortable enough to also start talking a little bit about, perhaps, a crossover point or an inflection point in the productivity savings being higher than reinvestment rate as well so margins can also look like they're expanding? It looks like you had flat operating margins here, including the FX effects there. But that's better than it's been in a little while as well. So can we clarify, and give us a sense on the margin inflection potential as well?\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. So the unit cases to concentrate shipment, they're really impacted by Asia-Pacific and Latin America. And if you look at Latin America on a year-to-date basis, they're absolutely in line, and with Asia-Pacific on a year-to-date basis we expect them to be generally in line. So there's really no story there in terms of that gap. When you \u2013 and moving on to productivity, so productivity initiatives, yeah, obviously, we are seeing some benefit from productivity. In our margins, there is an impact in our margins from basically the structural changes. So, if you were to exclude structural changes, gross margins and operating margins would be higher and you would see margin expansion. And when you look at the third quarter, when you look at the leverage \u2013 so we are getting some productivity, but we also have an impact from timing of the DME from \u2013 basically from prior year that's impacting that timing from this year. That, by the way, turns around in the fourth quarter. So I think there are a lot of puts and takes going on around productivity. You are seeing some productivity coming through. We are continuing to reinvest behind our brands, though, but our margin expansion is masked right now by currency and structural, so if you pull those two things out, you'd see very good margin expansion.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And I would just add one point, Ali. I think what we saw in this past quarter in terms of operating margin expansion on a currency neutral comparable basis of about 100 basis points, we were pleased with that expansion. Now, the key is to do everything we can to continue and ensure that we execute fully on the five strategic points going forward so that we can continue to improve our trajectory.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, okay. That's helpful. Just from a structural perspective, as you mentioned it, one of the big changes obviously in the marketplace is the ABI-SAB deal, which is agreed upon, I guess. Can you talk a little bit about any of the deal implications to you structurally in that context? For instance, would you let them produce both for you and the blue system? Is that something you can shed a little bit of light on as now it's an agreed upon deal, it sounds like?\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Ali, we will not comment on any specific matters related to our customers, bottlers or any M&A matters, so I'll just leave it at that.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks anyway.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Faucher of JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open. Please proceed.\nJohn A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes, thanks. Want to go back as sort of a little bit of a follow-up to Steve's question. If I look at slide 10 in the handouts, if I look at North America, you guys are fragmenting that sort of last piece to market, that last piece of the route-to-market, and then also to some extent the manufacturing piece. Yet you're telling us, on the flip side, as we look at Europe, as you create this sort of wall that goes across Europe of all one big bottler, the consolidation is something that seems to be the right thing for Europe. So, can you talk a little bit about why fragmenting North America yet consolidating Europe at the same time, those are both the right strategies when they \u2013 I don't want to say they're diametrically opposed, but at least they appear to be somewhat in conflict with each other. Thank you.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: John, this is Muhtar. Actually, they're not in conflict at all. They're basically very complementary to our strategy, which is to ensure that we have the local touch, and we have also the scale, and we have the processes to meet customer demands and customer partnerships. And in the United States, we've actually not \u2013 you mentioned the word fragmented. We have a national customer management system. We have a national production system. We have a national information system that is basically all with their own governance models, and they're very fluid and very flexible to suit the needs of the business today. And then at the same time, every piece of the United States that has those elements really have enough size for scale. And then we have the much smaller, the smaller distributor bottling system that also the smaller guys are doing a great job in growing the business for us. And then in Europe, basically what we have is, the customer landscape in Europe is much, much more concentrated in Western Europe where just a handful of customers account for a very large portion of the total future consumption, the retail business in Europe. And therefore, when you look at what we have created in Western Europe, it basically suits our future needs in terms of working proactively with our customer partners, and also it gives the scale and also it give the local touch in each of the markets. So, from that perspective, just like what we have done in Japan, just like what we have done in South Africa, and large markets I'm talking about, it basically very much aligns to our strategy in how you think about what we're doing in the marketplace.\nJohn A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And if I can just ask a follow-up. I guess you talked about local touch with the smaller local bottlers in the U.S., and then you also talked about local touch in Europe. And I guess, again, just to play devil's advocate here, aren't you moving away from the local \u2013 I realize you're going to try and keep some of the local pieces through the new bottling entity, but it seems to me that's moving less local.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Where? In Europe? (45:20)\nJohn A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC: So I guess it sounds like you're trying to have it both ways, and I guess I'm just not following why one is so dramatically better than the other. Is it just simply sort of the smaller account piece on the U.S. side that creates the difference here?\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, the customer base in the United States and Western Europe is very, very different in terms of how it's structured. And so, we follow the customer, the needs of the customer, what matters. We follow the scale. We follow the necessity for speed. And we feel that the model that is being created in Western Europe will serve us very well for the next decade and beyond, and the same thing goes for the United States. It is proving that it is serving us very well in terms of getting us the scale, in terms of getting us the costs in production and cost of goods sold. But at the same time, retaining the local touch and retaining the local element that is really important in our business. Both of those are valid for Europe, and for Western Europe and for Japan and for South Africa, and for the United States, or wherever else you're seeing us create a better bottling system.\nJohn A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company. Your line is open. You may proceed.\nVivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nVivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Muhtar, I wanted to circle back on the comment that you made about the health of the U.S. LRB category. I mean, clearly, that's apparent on the still side of the business. But as I look at the syndicated data for carbonated beverages in the United States, it does look like the category is softening a bit, and I think your revenues were down three out of the last four months. So, I was hoping you could comment on the evolution of the U.S. CSD side, and the demand elasticities and how they're evolving, please. Thank you.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think, based on what we are seeing is, we're able to generate revenue growth, both in the sparkling category, very much so, as well as in the still side. And therefore, that's what my comment referred to. This is not just one quarter. This is multiple quarters. And at the same time, inside that LRB category that is showing very good resilience in terms of both price elasticity, price discipline, approach with customers, generating value for our customers, both on the sparkling side as well as in large and small customers in the still side, we are also seeing that we gain \u2013 and this is the 22nd consecutive quarter of us gaining value share in the marketplace in North America. And then the mix is really working for us, in terms of generating the marketing, where the North American market is the first market where we've started employing incremental marketing, better marketing, is generating also positive results for us in terms of the revenue growth, purely from sparkling as well as from the still side of the business. And, James, do you want to add any color to that?\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah. I mean, if you take a look at how we're driving the sparkling business, you can look at the transaction packages, which represent about 15% of the volume, and they're growing still again this quarter into double digits. So, we're very pleased with the marketing and the OBPC approach is driving positive revenue growth for sparkling on a consistent basis.\nVivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Bill Marshall of Barclays. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.\nWilliam Marshall - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you very much. I was wondering if I could ask you about the recent vote in Mexico. It looks like there's a proposal to reduce the tax on soda by about half on products with five grams of sugar or less per 100 milliliters. So, first, I was just wondering what you thought about the prospects of that, if you could give us any clarity on what percentage of your portfolio that would cover? And then, if we just think about it from a high level, and maybe, James, you could give us some color in a number of these markets. If we look at the Mexican soda tax as a template for the rest of the world, does this suggest any tempering of how some of the regulatory authorities are looking at the category, broadly speaking? Thank you.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: So, of course, we need to wait and see whether the recent vote produces the act of (50:01) law by the end of the process. It's only gone through one of the stages. So, we'll see where that ends up. Obviously, we are in favor of reductions in discriminatory taxes. I think, as we look out on how that has impacted the world and how that's being viewed, and it will be used as a case study around the world, the data we have so far is the impact of the tax was to bring down about six calories from the Mexican diet by the end of the process. So, we're conscious that obesity is a crisis. We know we need to play a role. We don't think that this is the silver bullet that anyone was looking for, and we think that much more work needs to be done if indeed a solution is to be brought to bear on the whole obesity crisis, of which over-consumption of anything, including soft drinks, would be a contributor and a part of the problem. So, we'll see where this tax ends up. Clearly, taxing diets and lights doesn't seem to be the right way forward, and therefore, if this measure goes through, I think it would be positive.\nWilliam Marshall - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. And the last question is from Nik Modi of RBC. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.\nNik H. Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. Just a quick question on Asia. Perhaps you can provide a little bit of context. It looks like that business may not be performing as well as you would like, broadly speaking. Is this a portfolio issue? I mean, can you just talk a little bit about what's going on across that region, so we can just think about that as we go into 2016?\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Nik, I'll just say very, very broadly, at a high level. We're pleased with our performance in China. Obviously, a lot of noise around China these days, but we have \u2013 as mentioned earlier in the script, we have an all-time high share for brand Coke in China. And we're growing in China, and we're gaining share in China, and we're investing in China and the same goes for India, two of the very large markets in Asia, certainly pleased with the results there. We had some weather-related issues in the quarter before, but we're coming back, and the business is really coming back and performing much better in India. And so, overall, I think \u2013 and then in Japan, we're seeing some green shoots in terms of disposable incomes. We're very early still in terms \u2013 to call it any color, but overall, I'd say \u2013 and then, obviously back in south \u2013 Australasia, the economy was very much related to commodities and it has suffered, and we're seeing the macro spillover from that. But I would say overall, up from this past quarter. We're happy with the results in the big economies, and then realizing \u2013 recognizing that we have got more work to do. And that's how I would leave it.\nNik H. Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Muhtar Kent for closing remarks.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you James, Kathy and Tim. So in summary, our company has undergone a substantial amount of change over the past 10 months to 12 months, and our third quarter results demonstrate continued progress against our five strategic initiatives. The long-term dynamics of our industry remain promising, and we absolutely believe that The Coca-Cola Company and the Coca-Cola system is best positioned to capture that growth in non-alcoholic beverages, and to deliver long-term value to our shareowners. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.\nOperator: And that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

Now let me turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. While many markets around the world face macroeconomic challenges, our focus on improving our execution enabled us to deliver improved top line results. Net revenues grew 4% on an organic basis, driven by positive price/mix and 3% growth in concentrate shipments, as outlined on our second quarter performance scorecard on slide four. Our top line performance was broad-based, with each operating segments delivering positive organic revenue growth, demonstrating the strength of our global brand portfolio and the robust distribution capabilities of our bottling partners. As a result, we once again gained global value share in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in the quarter, with gains in both sparkling and still beverages. This represents the 32nd quarter in a row that we've gained NARTD value share, an important metric for us, particularly in a tough macroeconomic environment. Notably, the levels of our volume and value share gains are accelerating versus the second quarter of last year. Unit case volume grew 2% in the quarter, cycling 3% in the prior-year. We've seen an improvement with all operating groups growing despite a shift in Easter holiday sales from the second quarter last year into the first quarter this year, as well as challenges in key emerging markets, most notably Brazil, Russia and India. During the quarter, we continued our strong focus on controlling operating expenses. Even with a double-digit increase in our media spend, we were able to deliver a 50 basis point improvement in our operating margin on a comparable currency-neutral basis and grow our comparable currency-neutral operating income and PBT by 6% and 3% respectively in the quarter. Finally, we generated record cash from operations and grew free cash flow 16% on a year-to-date basis, due in part to the six extra days in the first quarter, but also due to effective working capital initiatives, something Kathy will talk about later in the call. Last year, we took decisive action to reinvigorate our growth and increase profitability. Halfway through our transition year, we're pleased with the progress we're making, but recognize that we still have much to do. We're acting with speed, with urgency against each of our five strategic initiatives. First and foremost, our enhanced focus on revenue growth across market is delivering value share gains ahead of volume share gains on a consolidated basis, as well as in our International and North America businesses. Our North America business delivered a very strong quarter, with 5% growth in organic revenues and 8% in comparable income before tax. This performance reflects increased marketing, a disciplined approach to managing volume, price and mix as well as the shift of July 4 holiday sales and our Share a Coke campaign into the second quarter this year versus the third quarter last year. Importantly, in North America we delivered revenue growth in our sparkling portfolio in the quarter due to further expansion of our pricing strategy, resulting in 4% sparkling price/mix. Our disciplined price/pack strategy has seen wide adoption across all retail channels as we emphasize smaller proprietary packages, while also raising prices on traditional packages, including 12-ounce cans and two-liter bottles. While sparkling unit case volume grew 1%, transactions increased 2% due to strong growth in the smaller packages, which are on trend with consumer preferences, such as our mini cans, which grew volume double-digits during the quarter. The second action to reinvigorate growth is to increase our media investments globally to fully fund our brands across our markets around the world, while enhancing the quality of our advertising at the same time. In the markets where we are investing more with better quality, we're seeing better performance. Let me just give you an example of how marketing, along with solid execution by our bottling partners, is driving top line growth across our emerging, developing and developed markets. Starting with our emerging markets, despite a soft macro environment in China, we grew brand Coca-Cola volume double-digits. A record 20 million consumers participated in China's Coca-Cola Break consumer promotion, which along with the third edition of the Share a Coke campaign, fueled our growth. Turning to our developing markets; in Argentina, we gained both volume and value share and importantly gained value share ahead of volume share for the second quarter in a row, due in part to integrated marketing campaigns around Copa Am\u00e9rica, the main International football tournament for national teams in South America. Finally, both the quantity and quality of marketing in North America helped us realize four points of sparkling price/mix, resulting in solid revenue performance. The trends we're seeing in these markets, as well as initial results in other markets, gives us continued confidence that our stepped-up investments are working. Further, we still have significant opportunity in many other markets where we began increasing media investments towards the end of 2014. Given the typical 12-month to 24-month time period for these investments to deliver their full return, it will be 2016 before we see real results in some of these other regions. Turning to productivity; we remain focused on fueling our reinvestment through embedding productivity into our DNA. We're on track across all spend areas to hit key milestones this year and deliver $3 billion in annualized savings by 2019. One area, which we are seeing momentum is supply chain related savings, which benefited our gross margin in the quarter. Year-to-date, we've consolidated three distribution centers and closed one plant in North America, as well as began the process of installing in-line blow molding equipment. Further, we recently kicked off the next phase of our zero-based work, which consists of a launch in our international markets and a second year of this work in corporate, as well as North America. Zero-based work is a mechanism that helps our leaders make very tough choices to free up resources that can be redeployed and reinvested to fund growth. As we go through this process, we're working to ensure that the priorities we are funding to drive growth in our business units are also seamlessly prioritized across our entire system. The implementation of our new operating model is on track, and we have made significant headway on the previously announced head count reductions. This now includes Europe, where we began implementing changes this quarter following the appropriate consultations. As we begin operating within our new structure, we are actively engaging in connecting our global organization and implementing our standard processes. Finally, focusing on our core business model, we continue to make progress on our North America refranchising efforts. During the quarter, we transitioned territories representing over 5% of the U.S. bottle/can volume. Additionally, we announced the signing of new Letters of Intent for territories covering close to another 10% of the U.S. bottle/can volume. In aggregate, territories transitioned to-date and those covered by definitive agreements or Letters of Intent represent approximately 25% of the total U.S. bottle/can volume. We're getting better; we're getting faster, which is why we are confident we're going to achieve our previously-stated goal to have approximately two-thirds of U.S. bottle/can volume distributed by our independent bottlers by the end of 2017. Our bottling partners are critical to our success. We held our annual global system meeting in May this year; and I can tell you that the level of engagement among our bottling partners was very high. They are encouraged by our plans, and have committed to support our investments with further enhanced focus on local market execution. To conclude, I would like to address the macro environment, given the challenges many CPG companies are encountering today and the fact that approximately 75% of our operating income is generated overseas. The global economic recovery remains uneven. Given the continued slowdown of the Chinese economy, the prospective U.S. tightening cycle, as the U.S. prepares to increase interest rates, and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Greece and its place in the Eurozone. Additionally, many emerging markets, large and small, remain challenged, as evidenced by our low single-digit volume declines in both Brazil and Russia this quarter. While we have the right strategic plans in place to navigate through the volatile operating environment, we're not fully immune. With that said, as we pass the midpoint of 2015, we're broadly where we expected to be. I remain encouraged by our progress to-date, but also acknowledge that there's still much work ahead of us. We're confident in our strategies and execution, and remain on track to deliver against our full-year comparable currency-neutral growth expectations. I'll now hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Waller, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our financial performance, as well as update on our outlook for 2015.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter came in broadly as we expected. Organic revenue growth was driven by 3% growth in concentrate shipment and one point of positive price/mix. Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by positive pricing and product mix initiatives across many of our markets, partially offset by negative geographic mix, consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter. Concentrate shipments outpaced unit cases in the quarter, primarily due to the timing of shipments in our Asia Pacific group. After adjusting for the additional days in the first quarter, year-to-date concentrate shipments were generally in line with unit cases on a consolidated basis. Our comparable gross margin declined on a consolidated basis as positive pricing, productivity savings, and a slightly lower commodity cost were offset by currency headwinds and structural changes. Positive comparable currency-neutral operating leverage was driven primarily by the impact of structural items which unfavorably impacted gross margin, but was roughly neutral at operating income and income before taxes. For the quarter, comparable currency-neutral operating income grew 6%, including a mid single-digit increase in DME. Below the operating line; on a comparable currency-neutral basis, net interest income, equity income, and other income were lower, resulting in 3% growth in comparable currency-neutral income before tax. Consistent with the outlook we provided on the last call, on a comparable basis, other income benefited from foreign exchange gains associated with the euro-denominated debt issued during the first quarter. Our second quarter comparable EPS was $0.63, which included a six point currency headwind. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, our EPS grew 4% in the quarter. Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to a net gain recognized in connection with the closing of the transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation. During the first six months of the year, we generated $4 billion in free cash flow, up 16%, primarily due to the efficient management of working capital and the impact of six additional days, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from currency exchange rates. We returned $3.8 billion to share owners in the form of dividends and net share repurchases during the first six months. I'd like to take a moment to talk about working capital management, which we view as another key focus of productivity, as it is incremental to our P&L project and it adds significant value to the company and share owners by targeting cash flow improvements. In 2013, we initiated a program to better manage our working capital with an initial focus on our trade receivables and payables. As a result of this program, we have improved our cash conversion cycle, which resulted in $400 million of incremental cash flow for the first six months of 2015 versus the prior-year. Turning to outlook, halfway through our transition year we are where we expected to be, recognizing that economic growth remains challenging in many markets; notably Brazil, Russia and China. For the full-year 2015, our comparable currency-neutral outlook remains unchanged, although there are a few adjustments to specific items. Our outlook for net interest is slightly more favorable, offset by a slightly larger impact from structural items at the profit before tax line. We estimate an increase in the currency impact in the back half of the year based on the latest exchange rates, and after considering our hedge position, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior-year rates, we now expect an approximate six point currency headwind on net revenue, 11 point headwind on operating income, and a seven point to eight point headwind on income before tax for the full-year 2015. And we expect net share repurchases for the year to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. In addition, there a couple of phasing items you should consider when modeling the third quarter. Due to the timing of our fiscal quarter end, the benefit associated with the July 4 holiday fell in the second quarter this year versus the third quarter last year. We expect structural items to be a slight headwind on net revenue and a one point to two point headwind on income before tax. We currently estimate currency will be an approximate seven point headwind on net revenues, 13 point headwind on operating income, and a 10 point headwind on income before tax in the third quarter as we cycle more favorable rates from the prior-year. The variance between the currency headwind on operating income and on income before tax is primarily due to the cycling re-measurement losses in the prior-year. Finally, while not a third quarter consideration, I wanted to remind you that in 2015 our fourth quarter will have six fewer selling days. In summary, we are seeing initial progress based on our plan to reinvigorate top line growth, while recognizing that we continue to operate in a challenging macro environment. Therefore, while currency headwinds are increasing, we see no change to our full-year comparable currency-neutral growth expectations. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, ma'am. The first question on queue is from Mr. John Faucher of JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open.\nJohn A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you. Good morning. I want to talk a little bit about the advertising spending. There's been some questions \u2013 and I've had them myself \u2013 in terms of whether you're just sort of fighting a headwind in terms of trying to advertise the category. So, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing, how you're gauging the success that you're having, and kind of what we should expect from an advertising spending increase as a percentage of sales as we look out over the next sort of 12 months to 18 months? Thanks.\nMuhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, John. It's Muhtar here. I'll just say a few top line remarks about it and then also ask both Sandy and Ahmet to give some more specific details on their \u2013 in specific markets. I'd say overall pleased with our initial results, but as we've previously discussed and as I've just recently said it takes some time, anywhere from 12 months to 18 months, to realize the full value in terms of a return on those investments. We've found that disciplined quality marketing investments drive growth better than any other strategy or action. We're seeing good initial results in markets that have received the incremental media investment and also have improved the quality of marketing in our case, and the marketing investments in North America is a great point, which is a clear contributing factor in the strong performance in the quarter \u2013 continued strong performance in North America and the performance is getting better with 5% growth in organic revenues and 4% price/mix. That price/mix and that volume and that, therefore, growth in organic revenue would not have been achieved clearly without the infusion of that marketing and the quality and the quantity. In China, also seeing positive trends, strong marketing activation, as I mentioned in my remarks. Sparkling growing at 7%, Coke growing at double-digits in the quarter, allowing us to gain \u2013 continued to gain significant share in that market. And additionally, we're seeing accelerated trends in our value share gains, where you compare them against our trends a year ago. So with that said, clear that it will take some time for the full benefit on a quarterly basis as these investments take some time to ramp up, also challenging consumer environment and macro environments, and so, those are really what I would say. And in terms of our results, you see year-to-date, our marketing investments are growing and our margin is expanding by 50 basis points. So, I think the key is to be able to achieve both, and we are confident that we will continue to see more positive results. So with that, let me turn for some more specifics to Sandy and then to Ahmet for International example.\nJ. Alexander M. Douglas, Jr. - Executive Vice President & President, Coca-Cola North America: Thanks, Muhtar. And good morning, John. The core driver of our business across the world over time is the quality and quantity of our advertising and the related execution and activation by our bottlers. And in the U.S., over the past 18 months, we've vigorously pursued that strategy, increasing our advertising spend significantly, and you're seeing the payoff in the top line results that Muhtar just went through. But underneath that, a metric that you can watch also is just the price elasticity of our brands and how volume reacts to price over time. And it's a good metric of the payoff of advertising, along with the efforts of our bottlers in the marketplace. As we look ahead, we see advertising as an important proactive item to grow the business, but as you start to see in North America over the past few quarters, we're now leveraging the P&L, so that the infusion of advertising is coming from the accelerated top line growth and expense efficiency across the total business. So, net-net, it's part of our ongoing algorithm and an important part of the way we intend to drive growth going forward. Ahmet?\nAhmet C. Bozer - Executive Vice President & President, Coca-Cola International: Thanks, Sandy. Hey, John. We have a very similar story in Coke International. The bottlers and our teams have strong conviction about how better and more advertising drives top line. The examples that Muhtar quoted, there's more depth to that. I would add developed markets such as Germany and Spain to that list. I would add a developing market such as Mexico to that list. I would add an emerging market such as Nigeria as a good example. And there are other examples, where we increased media and we improved the quality of that communication, revenue results improve. Having said that, the history of this increase is less than a year for most Coke International markets. I would caution that it is early days; but definitely, we're seeing the positive examples of this action.\nJohn A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Steve Powers of UBS. Sir, your line is open.\nStephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks. I guess, first, could you just, maybe I missed it, but could you just address the reduction in net buybacks for the year and what lies behind that? Is free cash flow coming in weaker, because that would seem surprising, just given your working capital comments, et cetera? Or is there a competing use for cash that we should be considering? Just a housekeeping question. And then a kind of a broader question on productivity, the update and the report card you provided was certainly helpful, but I was wondering if you could maybe quantify what those initiatives translated into in terms of savings in the quarter? And how far along you are, admittedly early, against that ultimate $3 billion goal? I think that would help just frame where you are in the overarching initiative. And actually, if you could perhaps talk about other initiatives underway and what kinds of achievements we should look for on Q3 or Q4 report cards, that would be great as well? Thanks.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure, Steve. On the share buybacks; basically, we've given the range of $2 billion to $3 billion, so we're still in that range. We've looked at where we were for the first half of the year and then we looked at cash, particularly because of the currency getting worse in the back half, and just tightened the range. So, basically, we're still in that range, in that corridor, we just tightened the range. And then on the second question, on productivity, we have basically stated that we are $500 million for \u2013 we are on track. The working capital has allowed us to basically focus on share repurchase, even with the significant currency headwinds, so basically the productivity initiatives we \u2013 that we are on track. We didn't give specific initiatives that we were working on for this year; you know about the people initiatives that we had, and we said we were going to be on target with the $500 million for this year. They're still coming from the three areas, so we're still actively working on reducing our cost of goods sold and moving DME from more promotional activities into media spend. So we are basically on track. I don't know \u2013 I can't give you any other specifics, other than we are basically on track for the $500 million that we anticipated that we would have for this year.\nStephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Is it fair to assume that the savings build, and that there's more of an impact in the second half versus the first half? Or is it more kind of ratable throughout the year?\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: You know, I don't know that I can quantify how they come throughout the year. Part of it was dependent upon when we started to see movement with some of the people, and we've not gotten \u2013 for instance, Europe has to focus on the working \u2013 had to work with the Work Council, so their initiatives with people are really just starting \u2013 although everybody is aware, the movement of people is just starting. So part of that will be coming out, now that they've been able to focus on their moving people initiative, but I don't know that I can quantify the how and when it all comes through, because we focus on dealing with the work first. And we deal with the work first and then a lot of the other impact will kind of trail, making sure that we deal with \u2013 that the organization is appropriately set up for success going forward, which included focusing on the global organization and restructuring how we worked with the global organization. So all I can say is, we are on target with everything that we've done.\nMuhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Just adding to what Kathy mentioned, Steve, I'd say that also, in terms of simplifying our organization, wiring our business units closer and more directly to the functional centers in our company, that largely has taken place. We have essentially eliminated a functional layer in the company, allowing us to make faster and quicker and more effective decision-making in the company. That is already largely in place, and I think lots of continued work streams going on in COGS that will continue to benefit and help us to deliver more than the $500 million in savings for the year.\nStephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Mark Swartzberg of SFI (sic) [Stifel] (29:58) Financial. Sir, your line is open.\nMark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thanks. It's Stifel Financial. But good morning, everyone. I guess, two questions here; one a region question, Muhtar, and then more a strategy question. With Asia Pac, at least versus my model, the price/mix was disappointing. It's only a quarter, and you highlighted China and I think some product mix issues; but when you think longer-term about price/mix in Asia Pac, given the superior growth I think you expect from China, what's a sound way to think about that region in the larger Coke system? And then, unrelated to that, or less related to that, when you think about scale and bolt-on M&A, can you just update us on your thinking for the larger Coke \u2013 how you're thinking about scale M&A and how you're thinking about bolt-on M&A?\nMuhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. First, Mark, good morning. On the Asia Pac, I think it pretty much came in line with what we were expecting, and it's related to timing, it's related to how you look at it on a year-to-date basis. And I'll have Ahmed comment on that once I finish. I'll just say a few things about the second question. In terms of scale M&A and bolt-on M&A, I think you need to think, we will be again looking at bolt-on targets that fit our strategic portfolio. That's the way you should think about our continued interest in any M&A, and how we target M&A. Just the same way as you've seen us look at it in the last three, four, five years, how we look at the acquisitions that we made, in terms of Innocent, in terms of Honest Tea, in terms of ZICO, in terms of other bolt-on and then, more recently, the announcement from China that we had. So essentially, bolt-on acquisitions that complement our current portfolio, and that give us an ability to also scale it up from a geographic scale, goes up from a geographic point of view, just like you saw us launch smartwater in other European markets more recently. That's a good example of how the scale-up continues, and how we've turned smartwater into one of the leading premium waters in the world, both here in the United States and now in some other new markets. Ahmet, comments on Asia-Pacific?\nMark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Can I just ask one quick one there as a follow-up, Muhtar? It sounds like what you're saying there this precludes an interest in scale M&A. The focus, just to be super clear, the focus is on bolt-on to the exclusion of scale \u2013 and we could debate scale, I realize, but it sounds like that's the focus.\nMuhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I won't say it excludes anything, but I'm saying our focus would be \u2013 I think you should assume that it would continue in that area. If there's something that \u2013 obviously, the future, none of us know what the future holds, we can never be \u2013 we're always guided by the past, the future as something, and there may come some opportunities that we will look at. But, right now, what I will say to you is, base it on what I've said, the past few years being an indication of the future.\nMark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Okay. Got it.\nMuhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes.\nMark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you.\nAhmet C. Bozer - Executive Vice President & President, Coca-Cola International: Mark, just to add on to the price/mix on Asia Pacific, the minus 6% was not a surprise to us. It was expected, and there was a lot of timing between the first and second quarters. If you look at the first half price/mix for Asia Pacific, we're in negative 2%, which is very much in line with what has been happening in Asia Pacific due to geographic mix and other channel mix issues. So, no surprises there.\nMark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Great. Okay. Great. Thank you, gentlemen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Morning.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So Muhtar, clearly very strong 4% pricing in North America. Can you run through how much of that was mix versus price, and then comment on the sustainability of higher pricing as you look out through the back half of the year once you cycle the higher pricing from last year? And longer term, how you think about any pricing? Clearly, we've seen a big improvement here over the last year, looks like it's worked well in terms of limited demand elasticity, some more longer term thoughts on pricing in North America?\nMuhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, thanks. I'd say look, I think, North America delivered strong second quarter revenue profit, value share performance, driven by better increased marketing, better marketing and a disciplined approach to both volume, price and mix management. Few things; mix management is working in our favor, consumer is very much approving the smaller packages. Smaller packages are growing much faster than larger packages, smaller packages have a higher NSR per liter, per gallon, per case; and therefore \u2013 then when price driven by \u2013 and the ability to keep the volume where it is and gain the price/mix, our historic best in terms of the past quarter performance in the United States. Why is that happening? More marketing, more focus on better marketing as well. So, the rate is coming through, mix from transactions and packs coming through, that is the general comment I'd make. And Sandy, if you want to provide more color to this?\nJ. Alexander M. Douglas, Jr. - Executive Vice President & President, Coca-Cola North America: No, I absolutely agree with that, Dara. And our strategy is, as Irial and I said a year and a half ago, we were putting in place a strategy of building strong valuable brands with accelerated quantity and quality of marketing, and we were going to take proactive opportunities to get our price in line with the value of the brand and to lead price up in a consistent and strategic way, working on the development of packages that consumers want, in particular, premium packages, and the consumer is pulling very clearly to smaller packages, so they can enjoy the ice cold refreshing taste of one of our beverages, but in a portion size that they want. The net effect, as Muhtar said, is that we have a benefit for mix, but our strategy as we look forward is to continue to lead. We see this strategy of disciplined price pack volume management underneath the brand building of strong powerful brand, as a long-term strategy and we continue to take action across our system every day to reinforce it, to grow our capability and to continue to grow our business in a very balanced and disciplined way.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So, it sounds like the way you approach pricing in North America going forward, you think you'll continue to see progress both from a mix and rate perspective, and obviously while we could see a sequential slowdown as you comp over this period you're pretty committed to the efforts longer-term. Is that fair?\nJ. Alexander M. Douglas, Jr. - Executive Vice President & President, Coca-Cola North America: Absolutely. The strategy is very consistent and we continue to be optimistic about our ability to make the levers work because our brands are strong and we're investing in them and because our bottling system is executing very well and we continue to get better. I think one of the mantras in our team, Dara, is that we've got the right strategy, but we are just beginning to hit our stride from a capability standpoint and we have much more opportunity to improve than we have progress made so far.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Vivien Azer of Cowen & Co. Your line is open.\nVivien Nicole Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. I was going to focus on Diet Coke. While your total sparkling unit case volume growth was clearly impressive, Diet Coke continues to be challenged. And so, Sandy, could you please update us on what you're seeing in terms of North America? And then, Muhtar, if you could comment on any other geographies where you're seeing Diet present a challenge? Thank you.\nMuhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure, Vivien. Firstly, I'd say, the challenge is never taken for granted, but the challenge is broadly very much a U.S. centric one, so let me just preface that and then have Sandy comment on what's happening in the United States and also comment \u2013 give you some more comments on other diet drinks like Coke Zero performance and so forth.\nJ. Alexander M. Douglas, Jr. - Executive Vice President & President, Coca-Cola North America: Sure. As we've discussed in several of these calls and in our interactions more one-on-one, the Diet and frozen parts of the food and beverage industry have been struggling for a number of quarters, it's getting into years now, as the consumer, the U.S. consumer moves really strongly to fresh. It's a good dietary change, actually, for the country, but the impact on categories and particularly categories that are appealing to diet-oriented positionings has been pretty negative. Inside our particular portfolio, we have brands growing and have brands struggling, Coke Zero, as Muhtar mentioned, grew in the quarter. Diet Coke continues to struggle. Our near-term improvements, though, we're starting to see the consumer base stabilize. We have an incredible number of very loyal drinkers in Diet Coke that love Diet Coke, and our milestone that we're seeking to achieve soon is to level our revenue to match price and volume such that Diet Coke's revenue gets to flat and then starts to grow again. As we look ahead, what I would tell you about Diet Coke is that we believe strongly in the Diet Coke franchise. Diet Coke, the brand is the number one diet beverage in the United States and it will be for a long time to come. We also are looking at changes in the category. Our largest competitor is changing their formula and they'll be launching that in August and that'll create a lot of buzz in the category, some of it good, as the good science of the safety of non-nutritive sweeteners gets out in the marketplace and is reinforced. We are looking at multiple programs to not only strengthen Diet Coke, but to offer consumers adjacent innovation in the Diet Coke franchise and we're excited about the long-term future. But, as we say around here, it's a work in progress and a lot more work to do, but we still are very optimistic about the long-term.\nVivien Nicole Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey. Good morning, everyone.\nMuhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Bryan.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Morning. So, just I had a question about geographic mix. I think you came up earlier that geographic mix was negative in the quarter. And is there any way you can outline for us if geographic mix also had a negative effect on profit margins or profitability? I know there's a lot of moving parts in the P&L, but when you kind of look at it currency-neutral, you saw some margin expansion. My thought is, within that margin expansion, you actually had some negative geographic mix on margins. So, any help on that would be helpful. And then I guess related to that, as we're modeling out the balance of this year and I guess it goes back to Mark Swartzberg's question about the Pacific region, should we continue to model in negative price, geographic price/mix into our models for Pacific in the back half of the year? Thank you.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay. Hi, Bryan. Yes, on the margin question, our margins were negatively impacted by currency and by structural. Obviously, there is always some negative geographic mix that plays into that, but if you look at our margins and if you look at Pacific gross margins first of all, and if you look at them on a comparable basis, we lost some margin; but then if you take out currency and then you take out structural, then we were at positive margins again. And the issue more is about gross margin, it's not so much about operating margin. Then on your second question, which was...\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just related to price/mix, price/mix in Pacific, should we continue to see negative geographic mix there?\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It is normal in the Pacific to have negative geographic mix, just because of the base of the country \u2013 Japan, and then all of the emerging markets there. So, yeah, I would say for the remainder of the year, I would anticipate that we would have negative geographic mix in Pacific. Ahmet, do you want to comment on that?\nAhmet C. Bozer - Executive Vice President & President, Coca-Cola International: Yeah. I mean definitely not in the numbers that you've seen in the second quarter, but the general trend of \u2013 around a couple of points of (44:11). However, we do continue to aggressively implement our more balanced top line growth in terms of price and volume across the territory, and we are aiming to improve on that.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All right. Thank you. And if I could just sneak one last one in for Sandy, if we're looking at smaller packs, the effect of smaller pack sizes in North America and just simply looking at it on transactions, I know it's kind of early, but is it incremental? So, if we were just measuring transactions, are the purchases of those smaller packages, are they incremental to the base business? Or is it cannibalistic? Thank you.\nMuhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Before Sandy comments on that, Bryan, let me just also say that also, in many parts of the Pacific, since your question was somewhat related to the Pacific and in terms of geographic mix, I think sparkling and particularly, Bryan, Coca-Cola, again with things that are happening around advertising and media spend and better quality, is getting stronger. Whether you take Indonesia or whether you take Southeast Asia, whether you take China, sparkling is getting stronger, and momentum on sparkling is getting better. And therefore, I think you're also seeing a positive shift in category mix for us that is somewhat countered by continued geographic mix. So, I think there's a balance there, and I think we're happy to see that balance coming through. I just want to mention that, that important this year, we see that balance beginning to come through \u2013 more favorable balance coming through. And then, Sandy, if you want to talk about the smaller packages referenced?\nJ. Alexander M. Douglas, Jr. - Executive Vice President & President, Coca-Cola North America: Sure. The growth in North America transactions is healthy, and that's coming from a number of things, but the small packages clearly are driving a tremendous amount of positive growth. Some of it is cannibalistic, but the cannibalistic nature of it accrues to higher margin; so the mix shift is positive, and then you have the incremental transaction growth that's being driven there. And the primary reason is that the consumers want smaller packages. That's why they're buying more Cokes. Our marketing model is about more people enjoying more Cokes more often for a little bit more money, and that's what we seek to accomplish in the marketing and execution of our brands. And what you can see by the mid-teen growth of the smaller packages is, they're driving that transaction growth and transaction performance positive, so the net effect of it is that it's positive in net-net. The other comment I'd make is that we have data in some of our retail partnerships that shows that moms, in particular, like small packs and are returning to the category to use small packs as a way of giving treats to teenagers and others in the household, and it's a particularly positive thing, because moms can do that with a pack that isn't too big; whereas, for many years in the category, we marketed packages that were too big, that were either wasted or over-consumed. Our package mix no longer does that, and it's one of the reasons why our growth is accelerating.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Nik Modi of RBC Capital. Sir, your line is open.\nNik H. Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah. Thanks for the question. So, I just wanted to go back to the bottler reinvestment question, and maybe, Muhtar, you can give us some perspective on where the bottling match and resourcing has been most significant, just so we can get an understanding of kind of where there could be potential leading indicators on that impact on volume growth?\nMuhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Nik. Firstly, I would say to you, as I mentioned in my script, in remarks, that we had a very successful global system meeting back in May, and I've seen much more improved engagement and also commitment by our bottling partners across the board: small, large, Asia, Europe, Latin America, Eurasia and Africa, North America. So I'd say to you, it's broad-based; and I'd say to you that there is a great deal of excitement that is around our plans, particularly our reinvestment plan, and also great amount of commitment for better execution and more investment on the side of our bottling partners. So, as I look at the pipeline of investment, I would say, I am much more encouraged today than I was, say, 12 months to 18 months ago. And I believe that that's driven by our plans and, basically, our belief in the future, and what is happening is yielding early results, and that is driving that engagement.\nNik H. Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And Muhtar, are we starting to see cooler placements actually hit the market, and more feet on the street? Or is this kind of bottler commitments on that they're going to do it at some point in the next quarter or two?\nMuhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No. We see it this year, and we will see it at a trend that continues to increase next year and beyond \u2013 certainly over a three-year period \u2013 here in the United States, in Latin America, in Europe, in Asia Pacific, in Eurasia and Africa.\nNik H. Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Last question is from Ali Dibadj of Bernstein. Your line is open. You may proceed with your question.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks. A couple of things I wanted to talk about, if possible. One is around top line and one is around asset base. First on the top line, I think you guys have done a pretty good job explaining and playing out the pieces in terms of price/mix, which is great. On the volume side, how would you describe the company trajectory right now, from a volume growth perspective? So, do you think we've seen the bottom, in terms of volume growth, after a series of kind of plus 1% and now at 2% and some easier comps going forward? So do you think we should be projecting kind of a turning point upward, in terms of volume growth for the company going forward? And I'll come back with the asset question in a second.\nMuhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So, Ali, the algebra is volume times, price is what we generate as revenue and I think it's good that you ask that question and it's one of the important elements of the algebra. I think we're encouraged by actions where we basically expected to be. We're cycling 3% and we generated 2% and I think the volatility, as I mentioned in Russia on the verge of a recession today, from a macro point of view or Brazil where there's still significant challenges in disposable incomes; China disposable income levels haven't improved significantly. But importantly, improving trends on share were an all-time high in many markets, value share particularly which is very important and value share is driven again by the actions that we're taking. So, based on your question have you seen the bottom? I'd say, we're about where we expected to be, and we see that what we're doing is continuing to help keep that equation in place at an improving trend; equation being if the marketing wasn't there, the volume wouldn't hold up where it was and the price wouldn't hold up where it was. See it in that respect \u2013 both being propped up by the investments that we're putting into the marketplace and those investments being driven by the zero-based work that we're generating.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Very helpful answer. On the asset side of things, if you look at Germany and India and Vietnam, (53:12) those continue to do quite well. Seem like they're improving. In North America from discussions we've had \u2013 this call, other calls \u2013 it looks like that's getting better too. You know productivity and profits are actually growing finally. Do you think there are ways \u2013 what are the hurdles given all those improvements for you not to be able to divest or re-franchise those assets more quickly and have a smaller asset base, which is a long-term plan even more quickly than you've laid out so far?\nMuhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think you said it, those are continuing to improve. As they improve, they become \u2013 there's more that are getting in line for those assets and that's a good place to be. And I think basically we see those are great markets, not just in our hands but in the right hands. And that's the way we see it. And I think that we are encouraged by the internal plans we have, and I think that's all I can say right now. We're in a place where, let's call it this way, the fruit is getting riper.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. I just hope it's not overripe at some point. I appreciate it. Thanks, guys.\nMuhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: This fruit will never get overripe. It will be good on the tree and off the tree.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Muhtar Kent for closing remarks.\nMuhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Kathy, Ahmet, Sandy, Irial and Tim. In summary, our second quarter results were in line with our expectations and as we enter the second half of our transition year, we are where we expected to be. While there's more work to do. As I said, we remain confident that we have the right plans in place to restore momentum in our global business. The long-term dynamics of our industry remain promising. And we absolutely believe that The Coca-Cola Company is best positioned to capture that growth in non-alcoholic beverages and to deliver long-term value to our share owners. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.\nOperator: That concludes today's call. Thank you for participating.

Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent : Thank you, Tim and good morning everyone. First apologizes that for the stat of my voice I have a cold, so please bear with me. I'm going to start with some highlights from our first quarter performance and then review the progress we've made against our 5 strategic actions, we laid out last October to reignite growth.  Finally, I will touch on our outlook for the remainder of the year, before I turn the call over to Cathy. To take you through more details on the financial results. Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased to report early momentum in the beginning of 2015, a year of transition for the company. We delivered promising first quarter results, especially in light of the significant macroeconomic volatility in many regions around the world and the productivity and rewiring initiatives we are implementing this year. For those of you following our Webcast, you can see our quarterly performance scorecard on Slide 4. Our performance was largely driven by the strength of our global brand portfolio and the strong distribution capabilities of our bottling partners as evidence by our continued global value share gains and NARTB, sparkling beverages as well as still beverages in the quarter.  While certain markets face significant currency devaluation economic slowdown or political unrest, our focus on improving our execution enabled us to deliver overall solid results. We grew our top line and bottom line due to initially improvements in the underlying business, the timing of Easter and six extra days in our fiscal quarter. Importantly, net revenues grew 8% on an organic basis driven by the extra selling days and positive 3% price mix globally while it\u2019s still early in the year we are pleased with the 3% global price mix and the 2% price mix in North America both ahead of full year 2014 results. This price mix is the result of disciplined implementation of our price back channel strategies which is a key and consistent portion of our long term approach to creating value for consumers, customers, bottlers and ourselves.  Productivity initiatives, [benign] commodity cost and favorable product mix in key markets grew gross and operating margin improvement. As we continue to invest substantially behind advertising leading to double-digit increase in marketing spend. The bottom line result was double-digit growth in comparable currency neutral income before tax.  Now turning to the five strategic actions we laid out for this year. One of our key strategic initiatives is making disciplined brand and growth investments. As mentioned earlier we increased our media investments double-digits in the quarter as we work towards fully funded brand plan in markets around the world while at the same time enhancing the quality of our advertising. Great example of this is the new Coca-Cola marketing campaign during the Chinese New Year which helped our China business grow brand Coca-Cola volume 9% despite slowing economic conditions.  As we\u2019ve said previous media investments take about 12 to 24 months to realize their full value. So while we are seeing initial positive results, we even more encouraged by the knowledge that is still early in the process and we have tremendous runway for continued improvement in our top-line growth. We remain resolutely focused on driving cost out of the business and embedding a culture of productivity into our DNA which is enabling us to fund our brand and growth investments. This change in culture is reflected in incorporating zero base work processes into all phases of our annual planning cycles. We remained on track across all spend areas to deliver more than $0.5 billion in savings this year and 3 billion in annualized savings by 2019.  The difficult, but necessary changes made during the end of 2014 are now accounted for in our budgets and tied to our objectives and goals. The initial implementation of our new operating model is on track and the previously announced headcount reductions associated with this change are well underway. We\u2019re continuing to work through the rewiring of business processes within the entire organization. So for example we\u2019ve eliminated a layer in many of our functions at the group levels in different geographies and linked our corporate center directly to our business units. In R&D this means connecting our corporate R&D efforts directly to our global development centers and linking both of these to service our business across -- business units across the world. So this allows us to scale our efforts in innovation, share new developments faster and accelerate development of new products.  In addition, we\u2019re also rewiring our marketing organization around consumer clusters to drive speed, to drive efficiency and effectiveness. This will allow us to better leverage learnings from similar markets regardless of the geographic location and improve the quality of our advertising through our networked marketing model. Great example of this is how we are strategically leveraging the 100th anniversary of our Contour Coca-Cola bottle to drive our business forward through integrating marketing, commercial and innovation under one umbrella to reach approximately 140 markets. This campaign centers of the magic of drinking a coke with the emphasis on the experience as much as the bottle and as such it\u2019s focused on driving profitable immediate consumption packages and purchase transactions. And as part of this campaign our system is investing in glass bottles all around the world while introducing the next generation Contour PET bottle and expanding the supply of our premium aluminum bottles in key developed markets.  Importantly, this is not simply a global campaign, rather it\u2019s a new way of networked marketing that has led to the creation of 20 marketing assets that markets can use leverage in more cost effective modular manner. Some of our markets will leverage the campaign throughout the year while others quarter-by-quarter. As a result we have significantly been able to reduce our production and development cost per gross rating point allowing more dollars to be focused against the consumer. We're seeing initial positive results for the marketing that have already launched the campaigns such as South Africa, Australia and Latin Center. Across the entire company our deeper markets segmentation strategy is also starting to yield early results. Two examples are North America and India here. In North America we're focused on generating revenue through a greater reliance on price realization, increased media investments coupled with our segmented price pack strategies drove revenue growth in our sparking portfolio through a strong 3% price mix and a 1% increase in transactions. Simply put more consumers are enjoying our products more often and are increasingly choosing smaller packages including our iconic Contour bottle.  Where as in India where our revenue growth strategy is focused on expanding distribution and recruiting new consumers we drove double-digit unit case volume growth in both our sparkling as well as still portfolio. Turning to our focus on our core business model we continue to make progress on our North America refranchising efforts in the quarter. First, we remain on track with our previously announced territory transfers to existing partners. During the quarter we transitioned four territories to Coco-Cola consolidated and are on track to transfer additional territories in Kentucky and Tennessee to consolidated and current Coco-Cola client this year. We are slightly ahead of schedule to close the previously announced transactions with new entrance into our bottling network. So territory transfers to both Troy Taylor in Central Florida and Reyes Holdings in Chicago are slated to close in the second quarter. Together the territories pending to transition to these two new partners will represent approximately 5% of U.S. bottle\\can volume.  Finally, just this morning we announced the signing of new letters of intent with the existing bottling partners for territories covering more than 5% of bottle\\can volume. In aggregate territories transitioned to date and those covered by definitive agreements or letters of intent represent the little over 15% of total U.S. bottle\\can volume. Further as we continue to transition territories with are getting better and faster, which is why we are confident that our previously stated time line to have two thirds of bottle\\can volume distributed by our independent bottling partners by 2017 is very much on track. Looking outside of North America, we closed our joint venture in Coco Cola Amatil, Indonesia in early April. I was in Jakarta earlier this year with the Indonesian bottler to celebrate this new venture. This investment will help us capture the growth opportunity in one of the largest and most dynamic countries in the world as we enable our system to be even more responsive to consumer and customer needs.  So, we are off to a solid start in 2015 and we are on track to deliver against our full year of currency neutral EPS expectation of mid-single digit growth. Importantly, I'm encouraged by the progress we have made and we remain confident that we have the right strategies in place to create sustainable shareholder value. However there is still much work ahead of us, we continue to expect that the benefits from the announce initiatives will take time to fully materialize. Further we are operating in a very challenging environment, the cautious recovery in the U.S. is offset by our relatively sluggish expansion in Europe and Japan as well as weaknesses in emerging markets, notably Brazil and Russia, as well as China slowing down. Therefore we remain cautious in our outlook, so we will continue to focus on what we can control and execute against our strategic initiatives to emerge stronger and better positioned to capture growth in the global nonalcoholic beverage industry.  I would now pass the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Waller, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our financial performance as well as update on our outlook on our business for 2015.\nKathy Waller: Thank you, Muhtar. And good morning everyone. As I'm going to spend few minutes discussing the quarter and then our outlook for 2015 as Muhtar just stated. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and encouraged by some of the early signs of success. Our positive pricing continues as we focus on driving revenue in the marketplace and our reinvestment in brand Coco Cola is staring to yield results. Focusing on the quarter, organic revenue growth was driven by 5% growth in concentrate shipment and 3 points to positive price mix. The concentrate shipment growth benefitted from the six extra days in the period. These extra days will reverse in the fourth quarter so you will see a corresponding impact in that period. After adjusting for the six extra days in this quarter concentrate shipments lag in many cases primarily due to the timing of shipments in our international markets. For the full year we expect concentrate shipments to be generally in line with unit cases. Consolidated price mix in the quarter was driven by positive pricing and product mix initiatives across many of our markets. In addition, we benefited from positive geographic mix as markets where shipments lagged recorded unit cases were in lower revenue per CSE market. As we move through the year I\u2019d like to remind you of a couple of points.  First we will begin to cycle better underlying pricing and second as we catch up from the timing up of shipments in international markets we will see negative pressure from geographic mix at the consolidated levels. Therefore while we remain resolutely focused on driving revenue in our market we do expect price mix to moderate from the current level. Our comparable growth margins improved about 75 basis points on a consolidated basis. This increase is driven primarily by better margins in North America due to positive pricing and business mix as well as moderately lower commodity cost.  As we think about the remainder of the year we will also expect many of these drivers to moderate as we begin to cycle more difficult comparison. Therefore our full year outlook on gross margins has not changed from our prior guidance.  Comparable currency neutral operating leverage came in better than anticipated in the quarter primarily due the strong growth in gross profit driven by the facts I just mentioned. Comparable currency neutral income before tax grew 13%. The combined impact of structural items and the provision in Venezuela resulted in a three point headwind on income before tax which was consistent with our previous outlook.  Our first quarter comparable EPS was $0.48 which included a six point currency headwind. On a comparable currency neutral basis our EPS grew 15% in the quarter. The six point currency headwind was slightly less than our original expectations primarily due to the benefit from foreign exchange gains associated with the euros denominated debt issued during the quarter.  Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt, cost associated with our previously announced $3 billion productivity program and charges related to our Venezuelan operations.  As many of you know the Venezuela government introduced a new floating exchange rate mechanism call SIMADI in mid-February. We re-measured our bol\u00edvar-denominated net monitory asset at the end of the first quarter using the new SIMADI floating exchange rate of approximately 193 bol\u00edvar to the dollar and translated our Venezuelan subsidiaries local currency income statement into U.S. dollars using that same rate. We generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, up 72% primarily due to the efficient management of working capital, the impact of six additional days and the timing of capital expenditure and it\u2019s partially offset by an unfavorable impact from currency exchange rate.  We returned $1.8 billion to shareholder in the form of dividend and net share repurchases during the quarter which is reflective of our commitment to return cash to shareowners.  In 2015 we increased our annual dividend by 8% to $1.32 per share and it\u2019s worth noting that we\u2019ve increased our dividend every year for more than half a country. Turning to outlook, while we are encouraged by some of the early signs of success it is still early in the year and global economic growth remains constrained by challenges in many markets as evidenced in regions like Brazil, Russia and China. Therefore we are maintaining our underlying full year currency neutral growth expectations as previously provided. However we are updating expected impacts from structural items and currency.  During our last call we said we expected the transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation to close in early Q2. We now expect closing to happen in later half of the second quarter as the parties are working to satisfy contractual closing considerations. However distribution of Monster products in the U.S. has already began transition into the KO system.  Finally, we are slightly ahead of schedule on close in the U.S. territory transfer to Troy Taylor and Reyes Holdings. We now estimate that the net impact of structural items on full year 2015 results will be a slight headwind our net revenue growth with no material change to our prior outlook on income before tax.  Therefore consistent with what we said in February for the full year 2015 we continue to expect mid-single digit comparable currency neutral EPS growth. However, we do see a slight change in the impact from currency exchange rates. After considering our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates we now expect an approximately six point currency headwind on net revenue and approximate 10 point currency headwind on operating income and approximate seven point headwind on income before tax for the full year 2015. The currency impact on income before tax remains roughly the same as our previous outlook. As the foreign exchange gains associated with our euro denominated debt issued this quarter is offset by the effects from translating our bolivar-denominated profit as the SIMADI exchange rate as well as the continued decline in several emerging and developing market currencies. So when modeling the second quarter there are couple of phasing items you should consider. The timing of Easter benefitted the first quarter this year, while it benefitted the second quarter of last year. We expect structural items to be roughly neutral impact on net revenue and a 1 point to 2 point headwinds of income before tax. And then finally, we currently expect currency would be an approximate 7 point headwind on net revenue and an approximate 10 point headwind on operating income and a 5 point to 6 point headwind on income before tax in the second quarter as we cycle most favorable rates from the prior year. The variance between the currency headwind and operating income and net income before tax is primarily due to that foreign exchange gains associated with our euro debt.  In closing we are cautiously optimistic about the progress we see in the business, which gives us increased confidence that our strategies and actions of working. With that said it is still early days in a transition year as we implement significant change in our company and amid a volatile and challenging operating environment. But we absolutely believe that the Coco Cola company is best position to capture growth in nonalcoholic beverages and to continue to deliver long term value to our shareholders.  Operator we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. \nBryan Spillane: So, just I guess as we look at this quarter it just seem like some of the things that you laid out at the beginning of the year that were within your control have tracked inline maybe even a little bit better than expected, sounds like the refranchising and North America\u2019s pacing maybe a little faster, closing the Monster transaction is taking a little bit longer and it sounds like you are sort of tracking pretty well in terms of cost savings and redeploying or spending more on marketing. I guess when we think about the factors that are outside of your control which would be I guess some of the macro factors, the change in the Venezuela exchange rates, how some of the markets are moving and not sure if you have a great sense for maybe what's worse or what's better, so if you can maybe just sort of lay out for us versus where you were earlier this year when you initially gave us guidance in kind of what's better and what's worth, specially focusing on some of the things that are outside of your control?\nMuhtar Kent : So, Bryan it's Muhtar here. Good morning again. So in North America, I\u2019ll start with North America. I would say that the outlook appears to be trending a little positive, raising hopes that potential ways growth and lower fuel prices could translate into consumer spending. In Latin America, Mexico's the best way I would say is relatively stable and continues to track closer to the Unites States because they are so closely linked. Brazil continues to deteriorate faster than we expected, I would say that. Venezuela continues to increase as a concern given to increase -- the growing difficulty on maintaining supply in the market place. And Argentina just continues to be challenging and Columbia is again as the kind of the star in Latin America in terms of performance and macro conditions. So in Europe I think there are also some green shoots on the back of [indiscernible], but its early days, that just started. But deflation still remains a concerned this year and overall consumer spending in Europe I would say is still sluggish as it will take time for I think monitory easing to flow to the consumer pockets and translate into increased consumer spending. And then risk to recover remains a still volatile environment and then off course you got the possible Greece exit issue still lingering on. In Eurasia and Africa, Russia continues to see significant challenges, the Russian consumer and we expected it to continue to remain challenging throughout the year this year.  [Sub-Saharan] in Africa is a strong bright spot and we're seeing that in our results and then Middle-East we've got some pockets where it's defined geopolitical environment, but overall obviously increased geopolitical risk there. And then in Asia and Pacific-China continues it\u2019s -- the disposal incomes, consumer spending, CFE in China continues to decelerate we saw that happening in Q1 versus the stated GDP of 7%, Japan remains sluggish I'd say similar to Europe although we are starting to see some green shoots in the economy and finally in Asia-Pacific India continues to be a bright spot I\u2019d say inside the brick in markets, the four brick market. So, though that's a sort of walk through in terms of -- and then the commodity environment again talking about what we can control and what we can\u2019t, remains fairly benign, compared to previous years, stable and benign. And so given that value growth for us is highly correlated to PCE growth and I hope I\u2019ve been able to give you a sort of quick walk through what\u2019s good and what not so good and what\u2019s more stable.\nBryan Spillane: That\u2019s very helpful Muhtar, thank you and I didn\u2019t mean to have you talk so long, your voice is definitely under some pressure this morning. Kathy, if I can just -- one follow up on the commodity piece, the comparisons were little bit better in the first quarter, just looking forward is there anything that we should be looking at that could make it maybe more favorable as the year goes on? Like how much of it is locked in I guess and how much of it might move based on commodity movements? Thank you. \nKathy Waller : As Muhtar just said commodities are for us will be benign this year, as we have worked in this quarter [indiscernible] recycling higher prices a little and back half -- in the first half of last year and thinking about something like oil, oil doesn\u2019t really impact us. So for our commodities, we\u2019re hedged. So we basically are not going to see specific benefits there because -- and they are going to be basically benign.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is John Faucher of JP Morgan.\nJohn Faucher: Thank you. I wanted to follow up on two questions related with the price mix number which is I guess one, if we look at the gallon variances you mentioned it skews a little bit more towards high revenue per case. So can you give us an idea in the quarter in terms of how much of that benefit in geographic concentrate shipments, how much we\u2019ll need to take out over the balance of the year? And then going back to some of the comments that you guys made I think back in December about sort of a different global pricing strategy in terms of really trying to find the right balance region-by-region, can you talk about the outlook for pricing in Europe, it was obviously price mix was flat this quarter but that\u2019s when where it seems like there is some opportunities going forward. So what sort of the medium to longer term view on pricing in Europe? Thanks.\nKathy Waller : Okay. John, I\u2019ll take the first part of that question. So the gallons and the cases definitely when you mix the [adjustment] for days, gallons are behind cases and we got real moderate and -- but that will be based on as you just say that is what we see in the first quarter is the high revenue for CSE and so we did benefit from positive geographic mix, in our price mix. That will moderate and we will start to see when that catches up. More of the geographies that provide a lower revenue per CSE coming through which will then give us the negative geographic mix, it\u2019s coming through as well in the balance of the year.  And I think the second part of your question on the outlook of pricing, Sandy do you want to talk about it all in the North America price range specifically? \nSandy Douglas: Sure Kathy. Good morning John. The North America pricing situation is really the continuation of the strategies that we\u2019ve been talking about for the last year and half. Irial and I talked about this I think six quarters ago that we were going to focus our business on the sustaining strategy of disciplined price, combine mix to maximize revenue. With an emphasis on price as a driver in the U.S. business and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve been doing and what we continue to plan to do with a lot of discipline and focus. As you look at the first quarter if you look at each business by themselves, we met our pricing objectives in the first quarter. We saw a little bit faster growth in our fountain business which created a little bit of negative business mix, but net-to-net the year started according to plan and we see the outlook as being rational and our strategy remains very consistent. Ahmet, you want to talk about Europe? \nAhmet Bozer: Thanks Sandy. Hey John. Just a couple of comments in general and then Europe, we are following exactly the same strategy of managing our product mix and price versus volume around the markets international, in fact we are getting some pretty good results in many of our big markets specifically in Europe one must remember that last year we\u2019ve had some fairly aggressive pricing which resulted in our view somewhat of an imbalanced progression of our business where we have lost some market share, but get -- got great pricing.  So we were saying before that we would be moderating that somewhat this year so that we have a more balanced growth of volume and revenue. So what you saw in the first quarter is the result of that sort of moderation, but we do believe that we would be achieving reasonable price mix in Europe in the course of this year. \nMuhtar Kent: John this is Muhtar, I\u2019ll just add one other point which is related to what I already mentioned that we\u2019re reorganizing and we have reorganized our marketing around the different clusters of developed, emerging and developing markets. I think that\u2019s also working, beginning to yield some early results and I think our new marketing leadership is very committed and very much part of this new reorganization of our marketing around the clusters and I can say very clearly that marketing is playing an important role in how we are generating enhanced revenue in our business that\u2019s really an important takeaway, I think.\nJohn Faucher: Great, thank you. Feel better Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: Thanks. I feel good, it's just my voice.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hi guys. So I'll give Muhtar voice a break and maybe start with Kathy. The quarter came in better than expected from a margin perspective clearly versus consensus, but with the extra shipping days and Easter shift its kind tough to judge your margin performance. So, I was just hoping you could give us some perspective on where margins and profit came in this quarter versus your original expectations and some of the key puts and takes in the quarter again versus as original expectations. \nKathy Waller: So, the price mix obviously is three points as I just spoke about, we did benefit from the positive geographic mix and -- in the first quarter and as we will get concentrate shipments and timing starts to catch up we will have the impact of negative geographic mix which is for us is not surprising, that it's kind of normal run rate for several of our geography. So we did get the price in the quarter and in the benefit and then we had decided that would be the cost and when you adjust for structural and you adjust the currencies, cost of goods is really in line with concentrate shipments and then the other issue would then just be commodities and then as we\u2019re said the commodities are basically going to be benign for us and in the quarter we are cycling higher cost from full last year. So that was a slight benefit and that's for the most part and as I\u2019m looking into the rest of the year commodity is still going to be benign so it\u2019s really basically the pricing that we got this quarter, offset by the cost that were better than prior year because we cycled a better cost.\nDara Mohsenian: Okay and then when you put everything together would you say from a profit standpoint or margin standpoint where did the quarter come in versus original expectations at the corporate level?\nKathy Waller: So, and also would add, one of the thing is seeing addition in North America specifically we had better mix which basically was about our food service business. So for the first quarter in our transition year we are obviously very pleased with our result and I would say that -- I would expect pricing to moderate for the back half of the year and continue with the cost commodity -- the cost of [control] continue to be in line with the concentrate shipment. So we we're -- basically given the quarter in line with our expectations and we expect to be in line with our full year expectations that we have provided. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next is Steve Powers of UBS.\nSteve Powers: Thanks. Muhtar feel free to weigh in, but I'll also try to give you a break and direct questions to Sandy and Kathy. So guys on North America the price utilization was solid but was actually a little lower than I at least had expected, just based on market data and I know you were lapping some fairly intense retailer promotion, so maybe that played a role, maybe it was again negative mix from still. I know you mentioned fountain dynamics Sandy, but I was hoping if you could expand on the trends there and whether you think 2% is a representative number for the year? This in term just the way you are charging it? And then on a related note I was wondering if you also dimension for us the profit contribution to this price mix you are getting because clearly if it was all rates, Tier rate then it would sort of flow through 100% to profit all as equal. But given that lot of what we\u2019re seeing is category mix and these are just introduction of new package types. I'm wondering how to think about that profit contribution. Should we be assuming 50% as a rule of thumb roughly or are there reasons to be more optimistic or cautious related to extrapolating price mix to profit flow through?\nMuhtar Kent: Steve the comment I make about overall pricing are to reiterate what I said earlier which is that on a business by business basis our pricing results in the first quarter we're solid, you saw in the Nelson very strong price growth, some of that was driven by wholesale improvement that we were achieving with our customers, some of that was lapping some really aggressive promotional activity that happens in the end of February and early march and some it was our customers making more money in the category, so the net effect of it was a really good start to the year in line with our plan. If you cross our business over into our chilled minute maid business, we saw price realization there. We launched some new items that drove some incremental revenue and then as I mentioned the fountain business was stronger than we expected at the beginning of the year which creates a business mix drag overall. What I say from a profitability standpoint is that the combination of rate and mix was in line with our expectations, but I\u2019d also pointed out that as we get into the second half of the year you are going to see more difficult pricing comparisons and we will continue our strategy of rigorous and disciplined and focused price volume management but will be lapping our sales and we\u2019ll be continuing to do so but against the little bit tougher comparison. So net-to-net up to the start we\u2019d hope to. Irial, any additional dimension?\nIrial Finan: I think I\u2019m repeating what you said but I\u2019d go back and I\u2019d say this for six calls. We\u2019re being very disciplined and rational about our pricing and what we\u2019ve achieved in the first quarter is pretty well in line, Sandy has mentioned there is some channel mix impacts in there, but generally speaking very much in line. We intend to say disciplined and [indiscernible] ordinarily be boring in terms of how we approach the business. We wanted to remain disciplined and focused and doing the right things in the business and we believe we are on a good track. We intend to stand on track and I think as this quarter goes by you\u2019ll see positive momentum in the business.\nMuhtar Kent: Can I just add one more thing there, that what Irial just said then creates the environment for our small packages to grow and the consumer is moving strongly to small packages and we\u2019re continuing to see low to mid-teens growth in those packages and all of which is supported by the impact of a step up in marketing which gives the whole thing more sustainability as we work through the more challenging comps. \nSteve Powers: Okay. Maybe just follow up sort of related to seeing in different angle, maybe this is for Kathy. I noticed you\u2019ve changed the reporting of regional profit to profit before tax, so regional operating profits or profit before tax consistent with the incentive changes you made. North American PBT was up like 100 basis points -- 180 basis points or so but I was wondering if you can comment, A; if there was any material benefit from sub-bottling payments in the quarter and B; if OI margin trends would have been sort of -- would have mirrored PBT and then assuming so, how much of that 180 basis points improvement was driven by some of the better pricing realization, the better productivity commodities that can kind of continue as a run rate versus timing benefits in the quarter related to the Easter and the calendar shifts? So if 180 is representative sort of the underlying OI trends and then what\u2019s the real run rate that we should be thinking about as sort of expecting margin improvement on the year? Thanks.\nKathy Waller : So the expected margin improvement over the balance of the year as Sandy just said, so we\u2019ve got good pricing in the quarter and as Irial said we\u2019re very focused on continuing to be rational in price. We have higher comps in the back half of the year for pricing that we have to cycle. So as far as the franchising is concern I wouldn\u2019t expect to see much benefit at this point from the sub-bottling payments and as you know if you look at it from an external perspective, we have through structurally adjust those we\u2019ve pulled them out. We pull out the benefits so that we put it back on an apples-to-apples basis year-over-year.  So there is not a big difference at operating versus PBT in our North American operations at this point. So the margin expansion that is basically really good pricing as we get really good pricing in the fourth quarter of last year, they are very focused on pricing that will continue, but are cycling higher prices in the back half of this year. \nOperator: Thank you. Next question is Bill Chappell of SunTrust. \nBill Chappell: I guess two questions, I\u2019ll lump them together. One, on diet coke in the U.S. it did look like most recently the Nelson\u2019s looks like actually a positive number and we haven\u2019t seen that in a while, just wanted to see if maybe the trend you feel like you\u2019ve got behind that where we could see some growth going forward at least stabilization. And then the second question, on the refranchising, anything you\u2019ve seen thus far, I know it\u2019s early, where it may be accelerated even further in terms of the bottler network where it\u2019s just -- may be you have more of an update later as we move to the year?\nSandy Douglas: Bill, on diet coke I would describe diet coke still as a work in progress. We have done a number of things on the basics of marketing, graphics, adverting, packaging. We have some very advanced sort of big data driven customer relationship programs going on with consumers who love diet coke and we are seeing some improvement in the year-over-year revenue. But we\u2019re still very much focused on that as a work in progress and expect to. But I would say this, the team and I and our whole system believes that in fact we\u2019ll return diet coke to grow in the long term, but recent improvement, that still work in progress.  On refranchising, the refranchising is going according to plan. It is a, as we said before a massive project. We are putting the entire system in the common ERP systems and refranchising the territories one sale center at a time to make sure that the capability that we build continues to grow and that our customers are well served in the process and we\u2019re pleased with the progress, We have a plan in place that we expect to meet or beat and we\u2019re always looking for opportunities to accelerate it but not at the expense of really high quality customer servicing capability.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.\nAli Dibadj: Hi, guys. So, throughout the press release and your commentary we pleasingly had heard and read about marketing increases so that's a good thing, that\u2019s very much on plan. However we don't really see or hear much reference to cost cutting benefit offsetting or funding some of those asset point, the only thing you said was, look we\u2019re on track for 500 million of cost savings this year. But we're not hearing or seeing a lot of that flowing through even offsetting things, I'm not saying all the way to the bottom line but at least offsetting from your investment. So when can we start hearing more about that savings offsetting your investments?\nMuhtar Kent: Well Ali, this is Muhtar. First if it wasn't for the savings we would not be able to be -- to do what you see us doing, in terms of generating net increase marketing, generating all the other things that's basically are part of our five point strategy of focusing on revenue, focusing on productivity, focusing on better and more marketing rewiring the organization for better impact and focusing on our core which is the franchise that we talked about. So I just sat to you, had is not being for the productivity we certainly would not be able to enable our organization to generate the kind of momentum that you see beginning to come back in that's clear there is no question about that. And so this is not a four or five sequential kind of compartments, these are very integrated sort of approach to how we bring more momentum into our business and everything that I mentioned is happening at the same time, better more -- better wide organization, better marketing, marketing that works around clusters, more infective marketing linked to social media as well as into a better cost per GRP. All of that funded by incremental productivity and so I think that's how you need to see our entire sort of different bucket of our strategy coming to life.\nAli Dibadj: So, a follow up on that and separate question for Irial, just a follow up on than Muhtar if you could, is particularly in terms of the headcount reduction and the saving there off. Should we see that ramping up throughout the year and at risk of being cut off let me turn my second question here on a separate topic is, we do keep hearing Germany, India, Vietnam bottlers and BIG continue to be actually quite well and I always pause whenever I see that and I\u2019ll see that in countries, but some of those names including Germany. But when is the right time to divest those and get them out of hospital ward and what are you looking for to make sure that happens or potential buyers are looking forward at this point to commit to buying them?\nMuhtar Kent: First, I mean I'll just say that I agree with you that they those bottlers are doing really well. Germany certainly is staring Europe. Southeast Asian bottlers are doing well particularly Vietnam the big one that we are running and I think it's important to keep in mind for you that Germany was not in the position to be refranchised until after 2012 because the consolidation was still taking place, so it's really being ready for the last sort of, it feels like 18 months to 24 months. And it has been the real bright spot in the Europe the last couple of years, it\u2019s profitable and we need to ensure that we get the -- find the right home and the right structure and the right value and so I could be clear with you that Germany is not a long term -- strategic long term holding and the right moment will be found. None of our, if you bike BIG operations are in a way long term strategic hold. So, that's what I would say about your question, Irial, you want to add anything to that.\nIrial Finan: I guess the only add I\u2019ll give is the three markets you mentioned actually are not in the hospital ward. To move those clients actually they\u2019re all performing very well now and we've been very transparent about refranchising. I\u2019ve said this many times in conferences that we would refranchise at the right time, Germany we've clearly said is ready to [indiscernible] in the meantime it continues to perform exceptionally well. We have a fantastic group up of associates and managements in Germany and fell very good about it. But I\u2019ve also said we expect to get a fair price, not get over paid but get fair price for territories because we owe that to our shareholder and we take it from there.\nMuhtar Kent: Just to build on what Irial said, we are looking for three things. So in terms of the right partner -- description of the right partner; one, proven management team; two, a strong financial capabilities and three, willing to invest in the business and growing the business. So those are the three things and then I'm confident that we will reach that goal. On your -- finally on your question regarding head counts reduction, I think you've heard about our previously announced plan and we\u2019re sticking to that plan simply said.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is Ian Shackelton of Nomura.\nIan Shackelton: You announced the deal in China last week and I was just keen to get a little bit more detail of how that fits in. It\u2019s obviously divided from the structure of what we\u2019ve seen with the more recent deals with Monster or [indiscernible].\nMuhtar Kent: Ian, its Muhtar. It fits right into the strategy of what we said, is bolt on acquisition where they make sense. And we will look at them with -- and where we believe that they fit into our portfolio, where they actually add value, where we can generate value for our bottling partners through that acquisition and it fits right in there. And that\u2019s I will say about that, Ian.\nIan Shackelton: Okay. Thank you. But just follow up for Kathy, I know it can be quite volatile with equity income this time has almost come to zero, is this something specifically in there that\u2019s causing that?\nKathy Waller : Our equity income is impacted by currency. So we actually have -- don\u2019t pull out all of the currency that\u2019s been impacted because if you think about some of our locations they have -- their geography, they have many geographies. So when we report we take the main currency and transact that into U.S. dollar that means that there is still often a lot of currency impact in those numbers. So I would read into it that is a very, very difficult currency environment out there at the moment.\nIan Shackelton: Okay. So this is not a case of it being something one-off in terms of the equity holdings there?\nKathy Waller : No, there is nothing one-off down the way of the equity holdings.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.\nBill Schmitz: Is there any way to sort of strip out what the benefit in the quarter was on the operating profit side from the extra days?\nKathy Waller : So I guess the way I think about it is if you take our unit case sales of one and use that as a surrogate because that doesn\u2019t have the extra days in it and you take pricing of three in terms of pricing and then I would say that did benefit from positive geographic mix, that we\u2019ll moderate over the back half of the year. So I guess I would think of it using this price mix in average sales in unit cases.\nBill Schmitz: Except that there was no fixed cost leverage or anything with the extra days that might help the growth in operating margin?\nKathy Waller : So the days or the operating expenses, I would say no there was nothing specific in operating expenses that would help by the six days and then the sales and distribution expenses are impacted by the six days so they kind of watch out, I would say that it\u2019s nothing there.\nBill Schmitz: Okay. Now that\u2019s very helpful. And then just on BIG, I mean the year-over-year margin expansion was awesome, I mean massive, what\u2019s driving that and how sustainable is it?\nKathy Waller : So again [indiscernible] but then, we did benefit from the size of the geographic mix. So I think the only thing I would say in terms of this it will moderate in the back half of the year as we will get more of a normal run rate of negative geographic mix from concentrate shipment. And then Sandy talked about the impact of the business mix with the food service business in North America. So I think those are things that basically will say that that number will moderate over the back half of the year as we are still in a transition year.\nBill Schmitz: Okay, great. And then just lastly very quickly, I mean the delay in the Monster transaction, I mean -- is there any more color you can give us on why it -- and I think it supposed to close at maybe late 2014, early \u201915 and you guys said March now it\u2019s kind of towards the end of the quarter. Is there still a high probability that\u2019s going to close then?\nKathy Waller : Yes. So there is no issue there. It\u2019s was going to close, we always expected it to close in the first quarter than basically it\u2019s just the regulatory process that we have to go through that is delaying the close. We fully anticipate that it will close.\nBill Schmitz: Okay, great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks very much for the time.\nKathy Waller : Certainty. \nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.\nJudy Hong: Most of my questions are answered. So just the couple of P&L questions Kathy, one just in terms of the structural items impact this year, it sounds like a quite negative on revenue now as oppose to the prior call. So just a little bit of clarification on sort of the puts and takes on the revenue impact. Sounds like the impacts on bottom line is pretty minimal. And then on the FX you have the re-measurement gain in Q1, that was about a little bit more than $0.001, is that really what\u2019s the difference in terms of your full year outlook for PBT impact being at the low end of that 7% to 8% that you had pulled out that time?\nKathy Waller : Hi, Judy. So on the structural, the structural is impacted by the timing of the Monster transaction and then anytime we accelerate in the refranchising that is also going to impact that number. So that\u2019s why we gave you different structural guidance. And then on the re-measurement gain, yes, that\u2019s basically when we re-measure that euro debt that impacted currency positively and so that is what changed the outlook for currency over the back half of the year. I would also join in the impact of Venezuela and change using the SIMADI rate going forward.\nJudy Hong: The timing of the Monster transaction though, I mean the deal itself is delayed, but you are getting the distribution into your bottling in this quarter, so that would be still a positive in terms of revenue benefit. But is the refranchising pacing really what's striking down in terms of the revenue impact?\nKathy Waller: So, the distribution is starting to transition, it has not fully transitioned, so that transition will take place over the year and so we at various turns and that's not something that's really under our control, that's really under Monster\u2019s control, as they transition that, so we can't -- we put in the estimate of how we think it's growing to transition. So it's not something that's already into our numbers, and that slower -- that's what slowing us. So, it's slower than expected because we expected it to start earlier.\nJudy Hong: Nice thing. Okay, that's cool. Alright, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Muhtar Kent for closing remarks.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you, Kathy, Ahmet, Sandy, Irial and Tim. In summary we're seeing initial progress in our plan to reintegrate top line growth. However we still have much to do and the full benefits from the announced initiatives are going to take time to materialize. 2015 is a transition year as we transform our operating model for sustainable growth, amidst a challenging global consumer environment, while the macro environment remains challenging in the near term, we\u2019re confident in our ability to return to sustainable growth and the long term dynamics of our industry remain promising. Our clients and our global system are un-parallel we are fully dedicated to strengthening our position as the world's leading beverage company.  As always thank you for your interest.

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Muhtar.\nMuhtar Kent: Thank you Tim and good morning everyone. Today, I\u2019ll cover a few key highlights before handing off to James to provide a more detailed operational review of our performance. We\u2019re committed to transform our Company to a brand-centric organization, leading a great franchise system. This journey began back in late 2014 when we got behind a set of strategic actions design to invigorate growth and increase profitability. Since then, we\u2019ve been advancing on our path to deliver greater long-term sustainable value to our shareowners, associates, partners and stakeholders. We simplified our organizational structure for speed and flexibility. We\u2019re driving aggressive productivity. We're redeploying more and better marketing. We're driving revenues through segmented growth strategies, and embarking also on the biggest refranchising in bottler restructuring in our history. 2016 was a critical year as we continue to make strong progress in transforming our Company while keeping focus on our consumers. We continued to gain momentum in building revenue growth through segmented market roles and disciplined brand investments. Since launching our incremental media investment plan in early 2014, our core business has accelerated top-line performance even with slowing macroeconomic growth. We strengthened our brands and portfolios through better and more marketing innovation and targeted acquisitions. We brought to market more than 500 new products, nearly 400 of which were tea, juices, coffees, waters or other still beverages. We generated over $600 million in productivity for a three-year total of over $1.7 billion, taking a balanced approach in investing in our brands, while leveraging our P&L in 2016. Finally, we continued to strengthen our bottling system. The world's largely independent Coca-Cola bottler based on revenue, Coca-Cola European partners began operations in a market that represents one of our most valuable profit centers. We signed definitive agreements to sell our bottling businesses in China, and we expect to close these transactions during the first half of 2017. Our two largest bottlers in Japan and Greek emerged, which will create a single bottler covering roughly 85% of our system's volume in Japan that\u2019s a very important profit tool again. We successfully helped to create Cola-Cola Beverages Africa, and we're now working to transition ownership to ABI to a strong partner of our choice. Finally, we've made substantial progress refranchising our North America bottling operations. At the same time, the North America business has flourished throughout this process, delivering top-tier FMCG performance with mid-single digit organic revenue growth in each of the past two years. Taking together, half of our system revenue has been in motion through these actions. We accomplished a lot and built a very strong and purposeful foundation for the future. Now, it's time to write the next chapter in our growth story with the appointment of James Quincey as our next CEO. I have every confidence in James and our management team. And throughout his career, James has shown insightful leadership in addressing the changing consumer environment by expanding product offerings, and most recently, driving systematic portfolio reformulation through reduced added sugar with hundreds of initiatives in progress. He's absolutely the right leader at the right time. James is well prepared to deliver the next level value creation. He knows that in order to deliver robust and sustainable value creation for shareowners will also need to create value for all of our stakeholders. I'm excited about what's ahead for our Company and for our system, and James will have my full and vigorous support as I continue to serve as Chairman of the Board. Now, I\u2019ll hand over the call to James who will take you through our operating performance in 2016, as well as provide thoughts on our performance this coming year.\nA - James Quincey: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Thanks Muthar. And it will be an honor and a privilege to succeed you as Chief Executive. This is the pivotal time of change by Company, our system and our industry. We\u2019re seeing consumer preferences evolve, technology and ecommerce transform the retail landscape, and of course, ongoing volatile global economic conditions. And the actions we\u2019ve taken over the past few years have set a strong foundation for our Company, and I look forward to steering us through our next phase of growth. I will take you through some of the house when we present at CAGNY in a couple of weeks. So today, let me just cover a few topics; our top line performance for the quarter; a summary of our actions and performance for the whole year; and a little on our expectations for 2017. Then I\u2019ll hand the call to Kathy to walk you through some additional financial details. So, let's start with our top line performance in the fourth quarter. Here, we delivered good organic revenue growth, even allowing for the fact that quarter had two extra days. Clearly, this was driven by 6% price mix, while volume didn\u2019t grow. Mostly, this is a result of what we plan for and expected with a couple of twists. Firstly, those things we expected included our continuing focus on momentum in our developed country markets; for example, North America, which had another very strong quarter; and also, we expected to cycle negative price mix from last year in Asia Pacific, producing a strong number this year. Things we saw occur in the quarter and responded to included; for example, India, where demonetization impacted the whole CTG landscape; our system responded quickly by facilitating digital payments; extending credit to mitigate destocking; and increasing our emphasis on the modern trade. Also, macro conditions worsened in Brazil. Here we chose not to drive poor value promotions to over-protect volume, but focus instead on more fundamentally resetting the price package architecture to support affordability, and this will take some time to fully implement. These not only hit our consolidated volume but in curious way mechanically improved our price mix as well. Now, clearly 6 points of price mix is a one-off and it's not our destination, nor is a 1% decline in volume. So, rather than focus just on the quarter, let's look at the full year results, which I believe are better indicator of how we think about the full year success in '16 and going forward into '17. For the full year 2016, we delivered 3% organic revenue growth, a mixed more challenging macro conditions than we expected. At core being the Company that will exist after the refranchising, our core business grew organic revenue by 4%, and we gained NARTD value share. Given the refranchising of our Company-owned bottling businesses, we look at this core business as an important indicator of the longer term trajectory of our top line, and remained encourage that we are growing the core in line with our long-term revenue target, even if at the bottom end. Finally, we expanded our operating margin through strong price mix and by balancing over $600 million in productivity with disciplined investments given the overall macro-environment in 2016. These actions enabled us to grow comparable currency neutral structural income before tax by 8% at the high-end of the target range we laid out at the beginning of the year. Now, I for some texture on 2016, I\u2019ll touch on a few of our operations around the world. We performed well in certain key markets. We took action in others those needed, and managed through some other difficult operating conditions. Our developed country markets performed well as we continue to execute against that strategy of transforming the system, investing in good marketing and better execution. In North America, we saw all elements of this strategy come together, resulting in 4% revenue growth; Japan and Mexico, both performed well; and in Western Europe, increased investments coupled with a new reinvigorated bottling partner brought good results there. Our developing and emerging markets saw more of a mix bag of performance. Markets like Nigeria and Pakistan performed very strongly. China, which began the year with a pretty challenging situation, but through a combination of adjusted strategies focused on the consumer, our performance is improved as we moved into the back half of the year. A few markets face significant challenges; Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, and they impacted our overall results. There, we focused on the basics like the example I gave on packaging in Brazil. Turning and looking forward to 2017. We expect another year of volatility around the world. I don't need to tell you about the rapid changes taking place at geopolitical and macro level, and how this will bring continued challenges and yet also opportunities across the portfolio. Some markets will get better and some will get worse. But net-net, we see the overall environment to be similar as we did to 2016. Historically, our approach has been to grow the consumer franchise in each local market by driving consumer incidence; effectively the number of consumers enjoying our grounds; value share and transactions; and to deliver locally, against our comparable currency neutral profit targets. So, while we are pleased with our underlying trajectory, our comparable EPS has not grown over last several years. So, going forward, if currency swings, our balancing out overtime currency neutral result to be a proxy to U.S. dollar growth, then we must adapt. So, importantly, we are intensifying our focus on delivering comparable EPS growth each year. We won't sacrifice the long-term health of the business, but we need to better balance investing to grow the business with delivering earnings growth in an environment like this. So starting with 2017, even in the face of strengthening dollar, higher tax and interest rates, we expect to grow comparable EPS before the impact of our M&A transactions; 2017 particularly those due to refranchising. So, while the refranchising effect in 2017 is meaningful, it ultimately has laid the foundation for accelerated growth. And as you read in our release, this becomes a much less significant factor to overall growth as we move into 2018 and beyond. Now, to deliver all that, it starts with revenue growth and then getting the operating leverage rise. Revenue growth will be built through a consumer-centric ground portfolio; by scaling in regions where we have leadership positions, like U.S. and Japan; expanding successful brands globally; and continuing to execute bolt-on M&A and partnerships. So, for example, we launched smartwater and Honest Tea in Western Europe in the past year, and plan to further expand in 2017. In the U.S., our investment in fairlife milk is paying-off. It captured over one-third of the retail bottler growth in value-added dairy during second year on the markets. And of course, sparkling soft drinks remain a key focus, as well in the principle categories in which we compete. Within our sparkling soft drink portfolio, we are reshaping our growth equations to continue to drive revenue growth, building over the revenue growth we delivered in 2017. We'll do this through a continued mix of great marketing, great execution combined with helping reducing over-consumption of added sugar. This includes the reformulated products to reduce content, leveraging our one-brand strategy to expand zero sugar products, and driving the availability of small packs. All of this we\u2019re approaching with a mindset of test and learn, knowing that not every strategy will work in every market but the speed, flexibility and adaptation are paramount to success. I look forward to sharing more of what we\u2019re doing at CAGNY. So, in summary; we\u2019re going to make the right decisions for the business and for our shareholders; looking out for the consumer franchise; tasking the local operations to grow locally; and managing across the portfolio and the levers of our business to deliver comparable EPS growth. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kathy to take you through our outlook.\nKathy Waller: Thank you, James and good morning everyone. As I look back at 2016, I am pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made against our strategic initiatives. We drove organic revenue growth; grew segmented market growth and disciplined investments; further embedded productivity into our culture; and strengthened our system in several key markets. Importantly, we delivered our profit target in this tough operating environment and we returned $8.3 billion to shareowners through dividends and net share repurchases. Now, looking at 2017, we have a strong foundation in place, but we still have a lot of assets across the system in motion. In North America, we will refranchise more of this year than we have accumulatively to-date. In addition, China will close and Africa is on track. We have strong plans in place and we recognize this level of change requires a disciplined focus to minimize any potential disruptions. As of any endeavor of this size, it is understandable that timetables may move. So the best way to think about our refranchising is to take both the 2017 and 2018 expected impact together to arrive at the total expected impact to revenues and profit. That way you can understand the dynamics and effectively model what in change in time of this year means for next year. Starting at the top, we expect the global environment in 2017 to be roughly similar to that of 2016 with continued macroeconomic challenges in the emerging and developing world, and continued growth in the developed world. However, there is a significant amount of uncertainty and geopolitical tension, which could results in a changing macro-environment. Therefore, we expect 3% organic revenue growth that more by pricing than by volume growth. And we expect the core business to outpace our consolidated results, consistent with our performance in 2016. We will take a disciplined approach to our marketing investments and our operating expenses in 2017. And we\u2019ll continue to full productivity through to the bottom line. At the same time, CCR, our Company owned North American bottler, is eliminating stranded cost as quickly as possible while transitioning territories to new partners. We expect the elimination of these costs to contribute roughly 2 points of underlying operating income growth. Therefore, with another year of price mix and expense management, we expect to drive very strong underlying operating margin expansion for the year. Below the operating lines, we expect an impact from higher interest expense, thereby, resulting in underlying income before tax growth of 7% to 8%. As you all know, currencies remained volatile. And since we operate in over 200 markets, we are not immune to this effect. Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we expect a 3 to 4 point headwind to come to income before tax. We expect our effective tax rate will increase in 2017 to 24% due to geographic mix, the impact of currencies and bottler transactions. So we are encouraged by the prospects for corporate tax reform in the United States. For business planning purposes, we have not assumed any change to U.S. tax environment for the coming year. Finally, we expect net share repurchases of approximately $2 billion. 2017 marks a turning point in our return to a more efficient capital-light model. It is the largest year for divesting profitable bottling businesses, primarily in North America. Therefore, we expect a 5 to 6 points structural headwind to income before tax, which will negatively affect our comparable EPS growth. So, while this is absolutely the right thing to do for our Company and our system, we expect it will result in a 1% to 4% decline in comparable EPS in 2017. Now, looking further out to 2018, while it is premature to talk about underlying growth, I wanted to provide some additional thoughts on a few items in 2018, given all of the complexity impacting our financial performance this year. First, based on the timing of our 2017 actions, we expect structural headwinds in 2018 of 16% to 17% on revenue, and 1% to 2% on income before tax. Please note, this does not include any impacts in the transition of ownership of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa or the acquisition of any other ABI territories, which will be minimal as we intend to account for these as discontinued operations, given our intent to immediately refranchise. Second, we are hedged on a number of hard currencies through the end of 2018, but a slightly less attractive rate than for 2017. Assuming today\u2019s spot-rates remained constant we would expect a low-single digit currency headwind to 2018 income before tax. Finally, we expect that absent U.S. tax reform, our effective tax rate would increase to 26% in 2018. Again, we believe reform as possible in the year ahead; however, the details are still uncertain and therefore we had assumed no change to the U.S. tax environment. Returning to the immediate future, there are a few items to consider. Our first quarter in 2017 has two fewer days than first quarter 2016, and Easter will follow in the second quarter this year as compared to first quarter last year. In some of the markets experiencing challenges at the end of the 2016, these conditions will continue into early 2017. For example, in India, where own the majority of our bottling systems the tough operating environment, stemming from demonetization, is likely to persist at the start of the year before gradually recovering. And due to the timing of when we issued debt last year and Fed rate increases, the year-over-year increase in interest expense will be more heavily skewed to the first half of 2017 than the back half. We expect structural items to be a 12 to 13 point headwind on net revenues, and 1 to 2 point headwinds on income before tax in the first quarter. Finally, we expect currency to be 1 to 2 point headwind on net revenue and 3 to 4 point headwind on income before tax in the first quarter. Now, for those of you who want to get us into greater detail, the IR team will host a modeling call at 11:30 AM today to take you through additional details, as well as answer any questions you might have. Prior to that call, we will post a separate modeling presentation on our Web site at 10:30, so you will have supplementary materials to follow. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: And your first question comes from Bryan Spillane of BofA Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nBryan Spillane: Hey good morning everybody, and just wanted to offer my congratulations and best of luck to both of you Muthar and to James. I had a question, James, in regarding price mix. And I guess as you\u2019re you kind of looking out over kind of what the environment is like over the next couple of years. Can you just talk a little bit how you\u2019re balancing the desire to get some price mix in with how you think about that relative to volume? And also relative to maybe affordability, especially in some of the emerging markets where the consumer environment is still pretty tough.\nMuhtar Kent: Couple of thoughts there, I mean, over the long-term we said we\u2019re looking for a balance between price and volume, well price mix and volume. And that\u2019s certainly our long-term objective. Now, given what\u2019s happening, I think it's almost as we said it's easier to divide the world into the developed and the emerging market. In the developed countries, we\u2019re looking to drive probably a little more price than volume, and you can see that happening in the U.S. marketplace as we focus on smaller packages, as we focus on higher value categories or sub categories. So you see that across North America, Western Europe is a little more balanced, and similarly into Japan. So, that\u2019s our approach for the developed market. In the emerging markets, obviously over the long-term, we expect them to be a bigger source of underlying volume growth, and that will bring the total Company equation into balance. So they would be more volume driven and less price-driven. Now, what\u2019s happening is in some of the markets, say for example Brazil where the micros are really under pressure, I mean, GDP over the last three years in Brazil has probably declined by more than it did in the great recession over the last decade of the 80s. So, there what we focus on is in any moment that we will do those promotional things that make sense and return. So, we don\u2019t over-protect volume, we do what make sense on a quarterly or a monthly basis. And the principle access we act on is trying to reform the packaging strategy to make it more affordable. Whether that\u2019d be small or one-way packaging or more returnable packages backed up by good marketing that really emphasizes with the economic situation, the consumers that are in and obviously great execution by the bottling system. So net-net, likely overtime, developed markets will push, will get more price mix and slightly less volume. And in emerging markets, more volume and slightly price mix with that caveat that those markets that struggled, we have a game plan that we\u2019ve developed over the years and that we find helps us really build a good strong consumer franchise going forward and balances the short-term.\nOperator: Next question comes from Steve Powers of UBS. Your line is now open.\nSteve Powers: So just -- and congratulations from me as well, to both of you. Just following on Bryan's question on price mix when have a great price mix quarter like you did here in Q4, I guess the question that is in my mind is why aren\u2019t we seeing more flow-through to the bottom line. Because in a vacuum you think 5 or 6 points of pricing mix would be significantly margin accretive. So, I guess, is it the case that what maybe mix-accretive, on the revenue line is actually margin or even penny profit dilutive on the bottom line? And I am thinking here really about the structural shift from sparkling to stills, but perhaps some of the packaging changes and geographic shifts in the balance of your overall business may play role as well. Can you just talked about that, why we are not seeing more profit flow-through on the price mix?\nMuhtar Kent: Sure. Well, I think you saw lots of flow-through actually in the fourth quarter. Operating income currency neutral structure was up 18% after gross profit of 8, so there was 10 points of leverage. So, we got a lot of leverage coming through. The reason I didn't translate from operating income to PBT is more about other factors, like interest or other corporate items. So, the underlying operation, actually when I talk about PBT growing at 8% in '16 and what we've guided in '17, actually the underlying operating income performance is actually even better than that. And then we've got a bit of a headwind in interest in some of those other items. So, there\u2019s actually a lot of leverage coming through from the operation as we focus on segmented revenue, as we focus on higher value category, as we focus on smaller packages, we're getting a lot of operating leverage between that revenue line and the operating income line. Some of it's getting that is often a headwind. So it is there, in the fourth quarter. Just to make the point, 6% is not projectable going forward. You will see in the numbers, for example, we were recycling a big negative in Asia Pacific from last year, so we've got big positive this year. We have some very good results and improvements where we own bottling operations, like China, which was very much richer in the first half. So there is some oddities in the fourth quarter. I would encourage everyone to look at maybe the full year '16, look through to the core operation where we were growing 4%, 8% PBT, bear in mind the interest headwinds at the higher operating income growth, lots of leverage. This is the game plan for 2017.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nDara Mohsenian: So, James, in your prepared remarks, you touched on plans to reinvigorate sparkling growth. Can you give us more detail on where you think you stand currently in terms of the areas you mentioned, effectiveness of marketing, you shift to long-tailored products, et cetera, and any big changes you\u2019re planning going forward to drive improved trends? And then you also mentioned tuck-in M&A. So, how big a role should we expect diversification into other sub-categories to play-out over the next few years for your Company? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Of course, I'll say some things for CAGNY. So, let me start with, the sparkling business is growing revenue, it grew revenue in 2015, it grew revenue in 2016. Momentum is rebuilding. If you look at the U.S., sparkling was up 1% in the fourth quarter in the U.S., in aggregate, in volume and obviously much more in revenue. So, there is -- the sparkling category is growing revenue. Let me, another piece on to that just take a couple of examples. In this quarter and last quarter as well, total -- if you take the combination of Diet Coke, Coke Light and Coke Zero, they came into robust growth in the back of the year, the growth of those altogether, so no calorie colas, exceeds the growth of the sparkling actually exceeds the growth of that total portfolio and most of our other categories. So, there is robust growth as we press into zero sugar colas, we're getting the growth. And in North America and some of the other places where we're pushing smaller packages, we're getting the good growth. Smaller packs in the U.S. grew almost 10% in the fourth quarter. So the game plan out there of smaller packages, zero sugar, re-engagement with the sparkling category, is driving the revenue growth and we believe it will continue to do so. And the shape and the quality of that, in terms of the suitability, is looking better overtime. Obviously, tough on M&A won't be sparkling related. We have consistently done a few things this year. Hopefully, we\u2019ll do a few in '17. We\u2019ll do those that make strategic sense, financial sense, and where we find willing partners.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nAli Dibadj: I\u2019ve couple of questions on guidance, especially in the context James of your focus on EPS growth, going forward. So, for 2017, very helpful in line with our thought process, at least; except why only 3% organic sales growth? For 2018, it seems like your EPS would be barely ticking up based on assumption of high single-digit comparable currency neutral income growth before tax, or so. So 2017 like based to growth. So 2018, looks like its growing EPS very much at all. Does that sound right on 2018, and why? Or is your statement in prepared remarks suggesting that looking 2018, we\u2019re going to things like incremental cost cutting, we\u2019re going to do things to really grow the EPS. And then I can't resist have to throw this one as well, slightly different. But why does the total gross structural PBT headwind look like something like 9% to 11% versus what you said CAGNY at 7.5%? So, thanks for throwing all those. Thanks.\nMuhtar Kent: I\u2019ll start, may be and then Kathy, if you feel like jumping in it, let me know. The 2017, 3%, I think we see a similar year in 2017 in terms of micros that we did in '16. And I think we\u2019re making a prudent call that given everything that\u2019s going on in the world, on a consolidated basis, we\u2019re expecting a similar outlook and a similar number for the total Company. Obviously, as Kathy said, we\u2019d like to see the core business grow above that as we did in 2016, where the consolidated was 3% and the core was 4%, which is the bottom end of our range and then that obviously lots of operating leverage. So, that\u2019s how we\u2019re seeing, and we just see the way the world is going. In terms of 2018, obviously, we\u2019re not providing guidance on 2018. We\u2019re just providing some of the elements that we know are important from a modeling perspective. So, obviously, 2018 conversation will have to wait. But we wanted people to understand the structural pace, because obviously the timing of when we sell those transactions makes a big difference. And so as timing varies, the structural adjustment can move backwards and forwards between 2018. So we just wanted to give people a total perspective. I don\u2019t know Kathy about number three. I am not sure we have the thing in front of us, Ali.\nKathy Waller: So the bridge of total structural versus what we\u2019ve shown at CAGNY. The part of what, I think is misunderstand stood in structural adjustments is, as we -- and particularly in this year, we talked about 5% to 6%. The two additional things you need to factor-in in your structural adjustments, the CCR business is not kind of standing still. It's continuing to grow, as well as the fact that they are taking out stranded costs. Now, we think of stranded costs a lot like productivity if you will. And so we have embedded those, and that\u2019s why I said in my prepared remarks to be at 2 point of productivity, of 2 points of stranded costs that are coming out as well in our numbers. But the stranded costs are more like productivity. In that they don\u2019t just transfer with the territories, we did work to do to get them out. And for some reason if they don\u2019t transfer, they\u2019re part of our business, and we have do work to get them out long-term. So the stranded costs, we treat that as part of the business. And you can choose to net those and that to understand the short-term impact. But that's how they represent themselves in our numbers. And again, we're not getting any other underlying growth guidance for 2018 at this point.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nWilliam Schmitz: Could you guys just give a little bit more color on, what sounds like a little bit lower advertising spending next year? I think, you mentioned in the prepared comments. So is it something that, like you've realized that maybe the advertising efficiencies and there\u2019s much. And how that -- like what the numbers are, is it going to be lower as a ratio and in dollars? And then it seems like there is a probably lot of initiatives you can support next also. And so like the plan was getting Coke Zero Sugar out beyond Europe, if that's also in the plan for the next year. So I tried to wrap two questions in one. But the absolute and ratio of advertising spend in rationale for reducing it and then if you do as that plan to take Coke Zero Sugar to other markets outside of Europe? Thanks.\nMuhtar Kent: So, firstly, the aggregate amount of marketing spend is slightly below gross profit, you are correct. Now, what is super important to know within that is we will continue to increase what we would call working spend of the marketing ahead of revenue, but we are driving material productivity in the way we organize and produce the marketing to become much more efficient. So, we are able to grow media, if you like, in all its different forms ahead of revenue. But with the extra productivity initiatives, we are actually growing total spend less than revenue, that's how that dynamic is working. So, we'll be out to do much more in the marketplace in a more efficient way. And then secondly on Coke Zero Sugar, absolutely you should expect this to move around the world things that are successful, and that had a great start in GB in the backend of 2016 was growing double-digits, very good start. We're rolling out in Europe. It just launched in Australia. So, you can absolutely expect this to push it into those markets where we think it can be really effective, including Latin America soon, so absolutely. And I think that is part of why you're now seeing the continued acceleration of Coke Zero Sugar each year. We grew several points faster in volume in '15 than '14, and we grew several points faster in '16 than with the rate we were growing in '15. And as I said, aggregate no calorie colas, is in good mid-single digits growth as we exited the year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJudy Hong: Thank you good morning and my congratulations to both of you as well. So first just a follow-up on price mix, specifically in North America. Obviously, we've all learned that the Nielsen data is not perfect. But there it seems to be a pretty big disconnect between, particularly in the fourth quarter where you\u2019ve got the 4% pricing versus softer pricing that we\u2019ve seen in the data. So, if you can just elaborate on that as a follow-up. And then James I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit about how much of a priority in '17 is really a shift towards still, if I look at '16 performance, 3% growth that you got. And still it seems like it could be much stronger in the context of a lot of the categories that seems to be growing at a faster rate. So, can you just talk about, either on the innovation front or investment front, how much of that focus would really that you\u2019ll look towards in '17 on the still category?\nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean, clearly, there\u2019s disconnect. I mean the Nielsen University is a much smaller piece of our total business. Obviously, when you look at the aggregate of North America, fountain is very important to us, it's almost a third of the volume in North America. And that\u2019s not going through Nielsen. And obviously, there is a lot of warehouse business there where we sell some of the still categories directly. But we have not deviated from our strategy. We talked on previous quarters that sometime the pricing will be at least the risk that the apparent pricing in Nielsen will look little softer or a little better. The important message is we have not changed our strategy. We continue to focus on realizing pricing intelligently and through packaging and pricing in the sparking category, and focusing on those, the other categories that we believe have value in terms of revenue and profitability. And so, every now and again you will see this disconnect between Nielsen and our total results. But no, that our strategy has not changed, and we plan to continue to pursue it into 2017. And then in terms of the other categories, absolutely, we continue to innovate and invest there. I think the underlying trend is even better than what it jumps out in the volume, bearing in mind the strategy is to participate in those categories as the highest value to us, both in revenue and in terms of profitability. So, for example, if you went to China and you look at what was happening some of the stills categories, maybe water, you see a growth rate of X. But what you don\u2019t see in the volume is actually we\u2019re selling less of the cheap water and more of the higher value waters recycle and re-innovate our business to drive the positioning and the premiumness through different brands and reset the way we attack some of these categories. So, we\u2019re asked to driving consumer franchise that\u2019s about incidence of consumers the number of times they drink our beverages, even if that\u2019s a smaller package and about competing from value on the top and the bottom line.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nNik Modi: Thanks, and congrats guys from me as well. Question, James, I guess is when we look at North America, numbers have looked pretty good relative to I think most people's expectation going back about a year and half. A lot of the initiatives that you have put in place have started in North America. So I am just wondering if you can help us map out how to think about what\u2019s happened in North America, and the applicability to the rest of the world? And that would be helpful. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Absolutely, North America has had a great run. The team has done a good job. The strategy is working. The numbers in '15 and '16 that put us at the top end of CPGs in terms of revenue growth with our customers, we\u2019re very pleased with that. I think what you see in the North American strategy, which is absolutely likely what you should expect is a fusion. And what I mean by that is things that they have done, they have taken from other parts of the world successfully. And they have blended it with new ideas and things that are relevant for the North American market, and that\u2019s what turned into the wining plan they put in place, and they\u2019ve executed, and it's doing well. And so, you should expect us always to be taking ideas from one place, applying the learnings in another place. And fundamentally, I think North America is a great example of where we reinvest marketing behind the right strategy and a balanced portfolio with execution by the bottling system. And I underline that, the importance of the execution by the bottling system and our own fountain and what wholesale business is during a time of tremendous change through the refranchising.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore. Your line is now open.\nRobert Ottenstein: Two questions, first, to the extent that you're able to talk about it. I\u2019d love to understand the thought process about not purchasing by, which Dr. Pepper ended-up buying. It seemed to check a lot of boxes. Is it the product, is it the timing? Any color on that. And second, could you discuss whether all the franchising, and particularly in Africa, has caused any disruptions in the business, any headwinds through that process. And a little bit more on the timing, you'd expected timing on Africa. Thank you very much.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I don't think it will be appropriate to comment on the M&A process of by, so I am going to skip that one, if I may. Refranchising in Africa, I think there has been a very robust process. And I think the management team of the bottler, both prior to the closing of SAB transaction under ABI on the board as well and ongoing. The management team has remained focused on doing the right things in the marketplace to a creditable performance by the management team in conjunction with the local business unit. So, we see no disruption there. And I think everything is going well. The refranchising itself as Muthar commented and as you've seen, we've reached agreement with ABI at the close of last year, and with the rest of the process is ongoing, both from a regulatory process point of view and a selection and determination of the partner from those that will be strongest in those that are interested.\nOperator: Next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nBonnie Herzog: Good morning and congratulations to both of you. I was hoping you guys could drill down a little further, on headwinds and the consumer, in some of your key emerging markets. And then, how has the overall category been performing in these markets? And really how is it been holding up given some of the headwinds and pressures on consumer spending, and whether you're taking share. And then, specifically in China, things seem to be accelerate in the second half last year. So could you guys talk a little bit more about current trends, whether that\u2019d be near-end and long-term outlook for China. Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean I think the emerging market is a very mixed tag. I mean there are some, which was doing well. I called out some, like Nigeria, which had a very strong year even in the close of the year as the currency came under pressure, places like Mexico. There are number of emerging markets, South Africa, which we did well in. Now, there are others where the macros were tough, whether that\u2019d be Venezuela, very tough, Argentina, Brazil, and there we applied our strategies, a combination of what's the right tactical use of promotions to balance the system. We don\u2019t want the scale, but we don\u2019t want to overinvest in promotions, while resetting the pack price architecture to really drive long-term affordability. So, it's very much a mix bag across the world. Obviously, India is something a lot of people have commented on. I am not sure any more I can add on the India example. In terms of China, I think China is a great example where you see us executing the game plan, I talked about for Brazil. So the China back-end of '15 coming into the first and the second quarters of 2016 was a very rough year to CPG, a rough year for beverages in China. We went for our game plan, exactly what I said about Brazil, we started to do some promotional things. And then we reset some of the pack price architecture. We\u2019ve focused on the right package sizes and the right brands, doing the marketing in the right way, and a reset of what was important in terms of execution, where you should execute, in terms of channels and focus to the city. So, in the case in China, the markets are actually doing pretty well in the top tier cities. There was lots of growth, look more like the strategy of focus on the value-end, focus on the premium end of the business and then in the more rural and lower tier cities, really affordability and smaller package sizes. And then in the second half of 2016, China rebounded. We grew in both the third and the fourth quarter in volume terms and in revenue terms in China. So, the game plan works. Obviously, it's not instantaneous but we know what to do when markets get into trouble if we focus on understanding the consumer, understanding the customer, and getting organized as a system.\nMuthar Kent: Yes, I\u2019ll just add one point just to complement what James said is that this was the 38th consecutive quarter for us in gaining value share, 38th. And then in sparkling, in NARTD, and in sparkling, this was the 12th consecutive quarter of share gains. And then in North America, importantly, 27th consecutive quarter of share gain. So, we continue to gain share as we implement this playbook that\u2019s really working, and the business is getting stronger over a much, much bigger base than any one of our competitors going forward. So, I just wanted to add that.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel. Your line is now open.\nMark Swartzberg: Thanks. Good morning everyone, and my congratulations as well, James and Muthar. I wanted to, if we could do tail of three countries here, James. And what I mean by that is Mexico, your results, the Asia's results, Walmex, Antab retail data. It seems that the consumer is doing rather fine there, and of course there is a lot of concern about Mexico, since November 8th. So, in Mexico specifically, could you just give us the feel for what you\u2019re seeing in terms of broad consumer behavior since November 8th? And then with Brazil and India, with the pricing you have taken some of the invisible, if you will, because of what you\u2019re doing with price pack architecture. What's the level of confidence you have in those markets that the elasticity that you experienced will not be worse than what you have actually -- that you have a an adverse elasticity impact, greater than what your model say?\nMuthar Kent: Sure. Well, Mexico, I think the -- honestly, I am sure the Mexican consumers in terms of what happened in the marketplace, the purchasing pattern, really changed that much pre and post that date. I think the Mexican economy there has been a lot of focus on it. There was a reform. So, I think it performed well. And we have a great business in Mexico. I think our system there has been innovating, it's truly one in the places where we\u2019ve been most innovative and most creative across the total portfolio where we compete in almost every category, and they've done a really robust job of building a good business. And I think that that is what you see in the Mexico results, and may continued to build on a strong 2015 with a stronger 2016. And I think it's a wonderful operation down there, and they did a very creditable result. And I think hopefully that will all continue into 2017. Certainly, where we think that our system is up to the challenge come what may in Mexico. In terms of Brazil and India, I think they\u2019re two very different examples. India, it was -- it certainly it's really one-off event. I mean, the demonetization effectively drained liquidity. I don't think that's about price elasticity, I think that's about the current shock to the circulation and liquidity. Clearly where the view that a formalization of the economy helps the formal players and I think it will work, it will be good in the medium term and the long-term. We expect the short-term disruptions to mitigate to tail-off as we come into 2017, though not from January 1st. And I think what we just need to see is some stabilization there. And we will be out to then come back and execute our game plan. So, I don't think that\u2019s particularly about resetting everything we do in India. I think it's about working through the effects of this one-off demonetization. Brazil is a different thing. Brazil, I talked about. I think we saw -- we've taken quite a bit of pricing in Brazil over the end of '15, and beginning of '16. I think the consumer environment got worse towards the end of the year in Brazil. I know a number of the states in Brazil had trouble with some of the public employee payrolls going into the back of the year. So, there was a kind of reduction in the mass of consumer disposable income, perhaps more aggravated in Q3 going into Q4. And I think that the elasticity and the effects of the pricing did become worse. I mean, the value of the promotions wasn't as good as perhaps the high-lows, wasn't as good as it was at the beginning of the year or even in '15. And I think that\u2019s what caused us to do some things in the fourth quarter, the balanced pricing and volume. But to recognize, we need to come in for '17 with a more aggressive reset at the pack price architecture. Given the circumstances in Brazil, they\u2019re not likely to be completely fixed overnight. And I think there\u2019s some focus on improving things, and we expect Brazil to slowly get better. But we are going to execute and implement a packed price some part, reset some part of it with the expectation that it will start to rebuild the business as the economics get a bit better.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Your line is now open.\nBill Chappell: Just a quick question on commodities, maybe I missed it. But the net exposure, as we look forward to this year in terms of headwind-tailwind, and then also maybe help us understand how that changes with the refranchising, I mean do you have less exposure to certain things or is it really unchanged?\nKathy Waller: So, this year, the commodity environment was relatively benign and we anticipate that next year is the same time. As we said, next year will be the largely the same as what we\u2019ve seen in 2016. We do anticipate that with the refranchising, our exposure to commodity, it goes down significantly. As we talked about, I think last CAGNY, so there is -- and we'll give you some more flavor of this, I think in the modeling call. But there is a significant change in the impact to the Coca-Cola Company is related to commodities.\nOperator: And now, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Kent for closing remarks.\nMuhtar Kent: Thanks James, Kathy and Tim. Last year, we made significant progress as we accelerated the transformation of our Company into a higher margin business, while keeping focus on consumers. With the strong foundation set now is a time for a seamless leadership transition. And I have every confidence that James is the best person to take us through the next phase of our sustainable growth. There is no question that this phase will look different than the past driven by a broad consumer-centric portfolio across all categories, while enabling consumers to control their intakes of added sugar. And this is going to require a change to some of our strategies, many of which have already begun and now need further scale in regions all around the world. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our Company and for joining us this morning."}, {"symbol": "KO", "quarter": 3, "year": 2016, "date": "2016-10-26 15:55:14", "content": "Executives: Timothy K.

If you have multiple questions, please ask your most pressing question first and then reenter the queue in order to ask any follow-ups. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Muhtar.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.: Think you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll touch briefly on a few key highlights before handing off to James to provide a more detailed operational review of our performance. I'm pleased to report that we delivered third quarter results in line with our expectations, and we're on track to deliver against our full-year expectations. Our continued focus on our five strategic initiatives enabled us to report another quarter of global value share gains, with 3% organic revenue growth and over 50 basis points of comparable currency neutral operating margin expansion. Our core business continued to perform well, delivering 4% organic revenue growth year-to-date, in line with our long-term target, driven by our segmented revenue growth strategies, improving marketing and portfolio diversification. Within our core business, developed markets performed well, delivering solid revenue results with 2% unit case volume growth year-to-date and a continued focus on price realization. While we continue to see challenges in many emerging and developing markets, we're taking action to improve our performance. Importantly, we're delivering the profit target we laid out at the beginning of the year. Excluding the impact of structural items, comparable currency neutral income before tax grew 7% year-to-date. And we're confident we will deliver our full-year profit outlook of 6% to 8% growth, excluding these same items. We continue our journey of transforming our company to a higher margin and higher return business, focused on building strong brands, enhancing customer value and leading a strong, dedicated global franchise system. This quarter, we continued to make solid progress to strengthen and evolve our global system. In North America, we signed definitive agreements on six territories and closed transactions on four territories, thereby remaining on track to complete our refranchising efforts in our flagship market by the end of 2017. In Japan, our two largest bottlers, Coca-Cola West and Coca-Cola East Japan, reached a definitive agreement to merge their operations and create a strong consolidated bottler, representing over 85% of our system volume in Japan. In Latin America, we reached a long-term comprehensive agreement with Arca Continental regarding joint value creation in Mexico, along with a similar agreement with FEMSA in July. Separately, Coca-Cola FEMSA reached agreement to acquire Vonpar, one of the largest privately-owned bottlers in the Brazilian Coca-Cola system, increasing its scale and leveraging FEMSA's strong commercial capabilities. In Europe, Coca-Cola European Partners finished its full quarter of operations as a combined company and we're executing an aligned plan. And finally in Africa, we recently exercised our call option to acquire ABI's stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. We have a number of partners who are highly interested in and qualified for these bottling territories, and we intend to implement our long-term strategic plan for these markets. Over the coming months, we will negotiate the terms of the transaction with ABI, followed by a regulatory approval process. Simultaneously, we have commenced discussions with potential partners and plan to complete this important process as soon as feasible. When I take a step back and think about the magnitude of change we have implemented over the past couple of years, I am truly encouraged. We've implemented segmented revenue growth strategies for our markets, invested in capabilities and created clear incentives for the entire organization to drive revenue growth rather than volume only. We're shaping our plan portfolio across the full range of sparkling and still beverage categories to meet changing consumer needs through leading marketing, innovation and targeted M&A, which James will discuss in more detail. We launched Taste the Feeling, a new marketing campaign for Trademark Coca-Cola at the beginning of the year and are seeing positive response from our consumers and customers. And through our ongoing $3 billion productivity initiative, we're taking cost out to both reinvest in the business and drive margin expansion. And, as I've discussed, we are re-architecting the bottling system in key geographies and regions to better capture growth. To put it in perspective, these affected regions account for almost half of our global volume. So the actions we're taking today are going to have significant impact on our system's future performance. Through these actions, we're becoming a much stronger company with higher margins and returns and better positioned to deliver on our long-term growth targets. I will now hand the call over to James, who will provide you with a more detailed outlook at our operating performance.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. As Muhtar said, we continue to implement our five strategic actions for growth and we're making the necessary changes to have the speed, agility and the focused leadership needed to win today and into the future. So before I jump into the results, as you know, we made a number of changes to our operating leadership structure during the quarter. I'd like to say these transitions occurred seamlessly, are a testament to our leaders and associates, and these new leaders are bringing a fresh perspective and are working diligently to identify opportunities to accelerate our performance around the world. Now, let me turn to the results. I'd like to talk to you about these through two lenses: firstly, the traditional operating results in the quarter, somewhat seen by geography; and second, how we continue to evolve our brand marketing and portfolio to stay relevant and meet consumer preferences. So, our performance in the quarter; our results were in line with our expectations, with 3% organic revenue growth and 2% underlying income before tax growth. Our core business grew organic revenue 3% in the quarter and, as we expected given the strong growth we were cycling from the third quarter last year, it's important to note that year-to-date, our core operations continue to grow organic revenue 4% and we remain on track to deliver this performance for the full year. Our company-owned bottling operations grew organic revenue 2% in the quarter, an acceleration from the first half of the year, driven by North American bottling and an improvement in China. Unit case volume grew 1%, cycling a pretty strong 3% from last year and an acceleration from last quarter, due largely in part to the return to growth in China and a stronger performance in our Western European business. It's worth saying that the macro challenges persist in certain emerging markets, particularly, for example, Argentina and Venezuela, negatively impacting consolidated unit case volume growth by 1 point. So, turning and looking around the world, we continue to push hard where we have momentum, take action where needed and manage through some of the difficult operating conditions. So, we continue to do well in a number of key markets with momentum, including places like North America, Mexico and Japan and so seek to further advance our strategies. For example, North America, we grew organic revenue 3% as we continue to successfully implement both our accelerated refranchising program while delivering top-tier growth among FMCG companies in the U.S. The strength and breadth of our full brand portfolio led to value share gains in both sparkling and still beverages. So that actually overall, we captured 40% of NARTD beverage retail sales growth year-to-date. Also, as I said, we did well in Japan and Mexico, and both benefited from strong marketing and innovation, as the combination of the One Brand strategy and new product launches drove continued solid performance. Turning to some of the other key markets, we saw improved performance in the quarter. Our actions are starting to bear fruit, but we still have more to do. In China, we returned to growth, driven by strong activation of our Olympic campaign, improved execution and, frankly, better weather. Our system has largely worked through the wholesale inventory issue. And we are continuing to innovate across the business towards the premium segment with examples like the launch of ZICO Coconut Water through the e-commerce channel, but also, at the same time, we're paying proper attention to the mass consumer segment. There, we're driving the availability of entry-level small packs, such as the 300-milliliter bottle, to address affordability issues, as the economy remains challenging and we expect continued near-term volatility. Another key market that got better, Western Europe; solid marketing, innovation and commercial plans with the increased alignment with the new CCEP in its first full quarter as a new company and, again, a little bit of good weather resulted in strong performance in the quarter with our system gaining both value and volume share. Now, while we're moving quickly in several markets and seeing success, it's true that we still compete in a number of markets with challenging macroeconomic conditions. The economic environment in Russia is improving slightly as the price of oil stabilizes; however, Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela all remain difficult operating environments for consumer products companies. Therefore, we will continue to concentrate on what we can control. In Brazil and Argentina, we're focused on affordability by maintaining key consumer price points while evolving our price/pack architecture to protect our market share. And in Venezuela, we are addressing raw material shortages by rapidly scaling the availability of our Zero Sugar portfolio. Now, as we look at this quarter but also at the future, I'd like to build on what I've shared in the past about our productivity efforts and evolving revenue growth strategies with an update on our growing and evolving brand portfolio. Of course, we recognize the consumer tastes and preferences change and are changing, and we are building a strong, diversified brand portfolio across sparkling and the stills categories to meet these needs, including through internal innovation, bolt-on acquisitions and a lift-and-shift geographic expansion model. If you look at our still portfolio today, it includes 14 of our 20 billion-dollar brands, with number one or number two positions in juice, coffee, water, tea and sports drinks categories. Year-to-date, our system sold 5.8 billion incremental servings of our stills brands, capturing over 25% of the value growth in stills globally. This performance has been driven by action around the world to expand our stills businesses. For example, take our Japan business, which has one of our most diversified portfolios. On top of good growth in our sparkling brands, we continue to drive strong performance across multiple categories through innovations like new premium packaging for our Georgia coffee brand, a new line extension of our Ayataka tea brand and new flavors of our premium I LOHAS water brand. In the U.S., we extended smartwater into sparkling water. We revamped the packaging graphics on DASANI Sparkling, resulting in retail value growth of over 80% in the quarter for these two products. We expanded the Honest Tea trademark into juice drinks, with Honest Kids becoming the number one organic juice drink chosen for kids. We see ready-to-drink coffee as an important growth category in the U.S. Today, we are the global leader in ready-to-drink coffee category with strong positions in Japan and Korea, so we are leveraging on this strength and launching Gold Peak ready-to-drink cold brew coffee and Dunkin' Donuts branded ready-to-drink coffee to begin capturing this opportunity in our flagship markets. In Europe, we're expanding our stills portfolio by lifting our smartwater and Honest Tea brands from the U.S. and shifting them to Europe. We are also leveraging strong existing brands. For example, we're expanding geographically Innocent, our very successful premium juice and smoothie business, into a strong regional brand, but also extending ViO, our popular water brand in Germany, into juice drinks and sparkling lemonades. This has resulted in strong double-digit volume growth year-to-date for both brands. And finally, bolt-on M&A and investments, when available, will continue to be a part of our portfolio expansion strategy, particularly in the value-added dairy and plant protein beverage spaces. We are pleased by the early results of fairlife in the U.S. and Santa Clara in Mexico and we look forward to closing our acquisition of plant-based brand AdeS in Latin America in early 2017. Now, turning to our sparkling business, I'd like to talk a little bit about how we're doing things differently. We are bolding our sparkling portfolio strategy so that we can grow while reducing sugar consumption. Through these actions, we've been able to outpace a category that is growing retail value by 3% for the first nine months of the year. So let me give you a few examples of how we're doing this. First, our Taste the Feeling marketing campaign is engaging consumers with better advertising around both the extrinsics and intrinsics of the brand. Second, we are also providing more sugar-free options. In several markets around the world, we have launched Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, with a new and improved taste as well as a new visual identity system under our One Brand strategy. And this is contributing high single-digit volume growth for this brand globally in the quarter. Take GB, for example. While we're only 12 weeks in, we've seen a significant expansion in the consumption versus the former Coke Zero product, resulting in strong double-digit volume growth for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar during the quarter. And we are rolling this out, this new and improved product out across other European markets. More broadly, we've been taking multiple actions to shape choice, to address changing consumer preferences around added sugar while working proactively with governments to provide positive solutions. We've been driving a systematic reformulation effort across our portfolio to reduce added sugar while delivering superior consumer taste and improving margins. For example, we currently have over 200 reformulation initiatives underway to reduce added sugar. And so an example of where that might take us as a step forward in GB, for example, we reduced the sugar and the calories in brands such as Sprite and Fanta by 30%. In our Latin Center business unit, we reduced the sugar content in almost two-thirds of our flavored sparkling beverages. And then in combination with this reformulation and innovation effort, we have also focused on small pack sizes: a great way to enjoy a drink with less calories. These packs can provide both a premium experience as well as being affordable, yet profitable, way to bring people into the franchise. In Mexico, for example, small packs such as our sleek can and 8-ounce glass bottle are growing rapidly through both increased distribution and higher velocity per outlet. In China, our premium-priced fleet count for Diet Coke and Coke Zero is growing strongly. And in India, where we recently launched our new lightweight, affordable PET bottle in just a few territories, we have already sold over 20 million servings. These actions and the results we are seeing give us confidence that we can further accelerate our sparkling business. So looking forward, we're working to grow by ensuring ongoing relevance and engagement with our existing brands, while also expanding our brand portfolio so that we can meet consumer preferences. So, as I think about the rest of the year, from an operationals perspective, I, like Muhtar, am confident we will achieve our full-year outlook. So with that, let me turn the call over to Kathy to take you through the numbers.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to talk quickly about our financial performance in the quarter before moving on to our full-year outlook. Starting at the top line, organic revenue growth was driven equally by volume and price/mix. Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven both by rate and product mix initiatives across many of our markets, partially offset by 1 point of segment mix, due to slower growth in our Bottling Investments Group than in our core concentrate operations. At gross profit, our comparable margin increased about 45 basis points, as solid pricing, a slightly favorable cost environment and productivity was partially offset by about an 80 basis point currency headwind. Our North America refranchising roughly offset the benefit from deconsolidating our German and South Africa bottling operations, resulting in a slight structural benefit to margins. Excluding the effect of currency and structural items, our underlying gross margin expanded over 100 basis points. Our comparable operating margin declined about 35 basis points. Similar to gross margin, currency headwinds impacted our operating margins by about 90 basis points, while structural items, primarily the deconsolidation of our German and South African bottling operations, positively impacted our operating margins. Turning to the cash flow, we continue to exercise strong cash flow management. Year-to-date, we have generated $6.7 billion in cash from operations. And we have returned $5.7 billion to shareowners through a combination of net share repurchases and $4.5 billion of dividends paid year-to-date, and that includes our third quarter dividend that was paid on October 3, right after our quarter closed. Net share repurchases year-to-date were $1.2 billion, and we continue to expect them to be $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the full year, in line with our initial guidance. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, with one quarter remaining, we continue to expect our full-year comparable EPS to decline 4% to 7%, in line with our previously-communicated expectations. However, we now expect to spend slightly less than $2.5 billion on capital expenditures for the full year, down from our initial expectations of $2.5 billion to $3 billion. As you construct your models, there are a few items to consider for the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter has two additional days as compared to last year, which will result in stronger top-line growth than we saw in the third quarter. We expect structural items to be an 11-point headwind on net revenue and a 6-point to 7-point headwind on income before tax in the fourth quarter. And finally, we expect currency to be a 1-point to 2-point headwind on net revenue and an 8-point to 9-point headwind on income before tax in the fourth quarter. So, in closing, our strategies are working in key markets. We are on track to deliver over $600 million in productivity this year, and we remain confident in our abilities to deliver our profit targets this year. So with that, Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question is from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now opened.\nNik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So just a quick question for me on the refranchising, now that you've kind of gone through the process and we're getting towards the end of getting all of the announcements out of the way, can you give us any early indications on kind of what the growth delta has been in the markets that have been refranchises versus not? And then, also wanted to get some context of what's going on in Western Europe, obviously, with the CCE integration going on there, have you seen any disruption, and if you think that'll start to phase out over the coming quarters. Thanks.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.: Nik, good morning. This is Muhtar. Thanks for your question. Look, I think first, once again, I want to reiterate the scale of what is being done here on a global basis. As I mentioned in my remarks, the geographies and the regions impacted by this refranchising, massive refranchising, is really when you aggregate it all, will impact 50% of our global volume. So this is really, really big, number one. Number two, the early indications that we have from both the U.S. refranchising efforts, which is the largest one, but also the European restructuring under the Coca-Cola European Partners umbrella, which was the biggest refranchising in Europe in history in its structure, essentially early indications have been positive. In the United States, if you look at it, the last six quarters, consecutively, we've had volume growth and very encouraging price/mix in the United States continued. And the last sort of year, four quarters have been the highest in terms of refranchising activity, so early indications are positive. Europe, the same; James mentioned the positive numbers coming out of the last quarter. Yes, helped by many other things other than just refranchising, but the impact is that there hasn't been the disruption. It's been going on very smoothly. And when you look at it going forward, we've got four to five quarters of intense refranchising remaining, as we bring out the other end of the tunnel another a company that is going to be totally transformed, revitalized in terms of its organizational capability, leadership structure, revitalization of the brands also with the investment in our brands and the new marketing, revitalization of our portfolio, of our bottling system as well as our cost base. So we're encouraged with what we see as the transformed Coca-Cola Company coming out and also the integrity of the refranchising, as evidenced by the continued good results in North America and in Europe.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now opened.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning.\nTimothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Dara.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So developed market volume growth obviously outperformed emerging markets in the quarter. That's fairly unusual. So I was hoping you could give us a bit of a review in the emerging markets. You obviously had a number of cautionary notes in the prepared remarks, but are you seeing any signs that the macros may be close to bottoming here or are things pretty tenuous? And, more importantly, as we look out to 2017 and beyond, do you think the year-to-date trends are more of a new normal or is there hope that with easier comparisons, that some of the strategy adjustments you've made, we can start to see emerging markets rebound closer to historical levels?\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.: Dara, it's Muhtar here. I'll just mention very briefly, and then pass it over to James, that it is unusual. What you've just said is definitely \u2013 the fact that developed markets are growing at a higher pace than the developing and emerging markets, but it's not a surprise given the volatility that we all know that is taking place. But it is a mixed bag. It's not just a uniform, all emerging markets. Africa, for example, continues to be a very strong performer, both West Africa, led by Nigeria, but also other markets in Africa. Mexico, to name another one, so it is a mixed bag, but let me ask James to comment in more detail on how we see the future also in terms of the balance between emerging and developing versus developed markets.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah, I think it is worth, as \u2013 morning, Dara \u2013 it is worth as we go into this, just underlining the collection of the developed markets are growing volume, growing price, strong revenue growth. We think we're taking actions to sustain that. The emerging markets, I think it's going to be a combination here of doing the things that we know we need to do and can control; and then, of course, is a question of what do the macroeconomics do and what actions do each country's governments take to put them on a better course or not? So that's part of the unknown going forward at this stage and the uncertainty. But I think quite clearly, you see, as Muhtar commented, is a mixed bag. Across the world, you see those markets that are doing well sustain growth. He called out Nigeria, South Africa, the Philippines, other parts of the emerging markets. So it's good. But it's a mixed bag, and I think the actions are underway in a number of these countries to stabilize them where they're a little tougher, like Brazil, like Argentina, which I called out on the call earlier. And we'll have to see how long it takes for this to take hold in the countries from a macro view. We don't have a clear sight on that. But what we do know is we need to focus on what we can control in those countries, go back to affordability, go back to execution, go back to the basics and build ourselves a better position with more market share, so that when it does turn and that combines with the growth in developed markets, we can be solidly in growth rates for our long term model.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nWilliam Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: A couple of quick questions; the first one is how do you get to 3% organic in the quarter from 1% and 1%? (30:44) So was volume better or price/mix better? I know they both probably rounded. I was just curious there. And then, the second question is the inflationary pricing in Latin America, is that mostly currency pass-through or is there sort of real price realization in the market? And kind of what happens into next year if these spot rates hold when some of the currency cross-rates starts to ease a little bit? Thanks.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Hi, Bill. So on your first question about the 3%. Yes, we did find another way to make 1.1 equal 3. It is rounding, and it's really balanced. So it was in the rounding, but it was a balanced impact from volume as well as a balanced impact from pricing.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: On your second question, Bill, James here, I think what's worth remembering is essentially, we are not trying to pass through the devaluation. We focus on being competitive in each local market beverage and fast-moving consumer goods industry, and especially when the economies are in tough times focusing on staying competitive and gaining share for the long term. The net of all of that means we are much more likely to follow or be close to local inflation rates rather than adopt the strategy of a full pass-through of the devaluation of the dollar. So obviously, if the exchange rates change, that'll mean different dollar numbers for the corporation. But the local strategy remains stay competitive in the marketplace, and it looks more like local inflation. Does that answer your question?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Steve Powers from UBS. Your line is now open.\nStephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping actually to go back and focus on the stills versus sparkling portfolio, changes that, James, you referenced in your prepared remarks. Today, correctly me if I'm wrong, but I think your global portfolio still skews at least 70%-30% towards sparkling. But as you look forward, I'm curious as to what percentage of your growth you expect will come from traditional sparkling versus stills. I'm guessing it's probably not 70%-30%, but is it 50%-50% or is it some other split you could frame for us? And then, more importantly, do you think your growth investments today are aligned with that distribution? In other words, if it is 50%-50%, for example, are your incremental growth investments aligned with that or is there still a legacy skew towards sparkling that might need to be rethought? Because I think from the outside, there's still a perception, right or wrong, that your incremental investments are a bit over-indexed towards core CSDs versus their future value contribution. And I was just hoping you could help clarify at least your thinking around that. Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. I mean, let me start by saying you're approximately right in volume terms on the current split between sparkling and stills, about 70%-30%. I think it's worth noting that that split has been moving in the favor of stills by about 1 point a year. At the turn of the century, 10, 15 years ago, it was a single digit percent of the mix, so it's going up at about 1% a year. Now, part of that organic on the things we're doing and part of that is the net of some of the bolt-on acquisitions. But it's going up about 1% a year of mix. I think as you look forward, clearly, given that we have 50% of the sparkling industry value share and 15% of the sum of all the stills categories value share, we fully expect to be able to grow faster in the stills categories because it will be the combination of the category growth rate but plus our ability to gain share, which then feeds into your third question, which is how are the investments aligned? I feel they're aligned. Obviously, it's an ongoing process. Each year, we look at it in the business planning process and we'll be doing that again this year. But I would not characterize it as we are over-invested in sparkling and under-invested in stills. We are invested behind what's growing. And actually, just to add a little more texture to it, we're doing the right things on sparkling. We tend to be pushing more money towards driving the zeros, the lights, the smaller packages in the sparkling business. In the stills, it's not a one-size-fits-all category. It's actually a noteable (35:07) category. And there, we're selective on which ones have \u2013 are most on-trends with the consumers, which one have more premium pricing. And therefore, we're very selective about where we funnel the dollars and invest ahead of the curve or in line with the growth rates we're expecting.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Andrew Holland from Soc G\u00e9n. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Holland - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker): Yeah, hi. Could I just ask you something \u2013 whether you could talk a little bit about the key qualities that you're looking for in a new bottler partner in Africa; any particular experiences or qualities that you're looking for?\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah, Andrew, good morning. This is Muhtar. I think you would expect us to be looking for proven capability, alignment and bottlers that have already got a track record in our system and that we have actually delivered together in alignment, and we have good examples of that, that we can refer to. That's basically it in a nutshell. And I think I know you probably have a loaded question but, in answer to your actual question, that's what I would say.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nBonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you. Good morning.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Bonnie.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Bonnie.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Bonnie.\nBonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I was actually hoping you could give us a little more detail on your stills portfolio in North America. You reported high single-digit growth in vitaminwater and then solid results in smartwater, but your still portfolio only grew 2%. So curious what's been the drag there? And then do you expect some of the innovations that you mentioned to drive growth in your stills portfolio back up towards the mid or even high single-digit range?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah. Bonnie, yeah, we certainly did well in a number of the categories, particularly some of the premium categories. What was a little weaker in this quarter were some of the juice businesses and some of the tea businesses, which are not as high value to us, so that's what netted out on the 2%. What I think you see is over the year, you see very strong growth in vitaminwater, in sports drinks, in some of the other categories as well. So I think it's a broadening of the portfolio, a focus on innovation, but yet there's some headwinds on juice linked somewhat to commodities.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Would just like...\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.: Hi, Ali.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Hi, Ali.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: ...a little bit of your perspective on two markets, kind at the extremes of maturity right now for you guys. So first on North America, which obviously remains a key concern when I talk to investors, just given the views of consumer preferences. But North America's doing pretty well, right? Pretty robust, stable growth, 3% organic sales growth, relatively good volume, relatively good price/mix. What's working well for you in that market? Is it price/pack architecture or stills, just better marketing? I'm assuming it's all that stuff. And what are you learning from that that might work for similar geographies, like Western Europe or Japan? And so should we expect kind of in those markets a little bit of a similar ramp up as we're seeing in North America? And then at the other extreme, can you tell us a little bit more about the China rebound, so to speak. I know you mentioned weather there; clearly, weather must have helped. Could you give us a sense of what you think the underlying growth is? Has the market gotten any better? Clearly, you've worked through, thanks to weather, some of your destocking issues, but want to get a better sense of China at the other extreme. Thanks for those two.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. Morning, Ali; James here. Look, North America, I think is a combination of many, many things. I mean it's, I think, been the result of a number of years working on multiple fronts: working on innovation across the portfolio, getting into categories, refining the propositions, learning, refining the propositions. It's about, in the sparkling business, the better marketing, the more media spend. It's about the focus on the pricing and packaging architect. There will be more smaller packages. It's about getting the execution right. It's the refranchising, bringing new excited bottlers. In the end, this is a result that has been built by a great team of people who have been very focused over a number of years about regenerating growth in the North American business. As Muhtar said, they've had six very solid quarters of volume and revenue growth. And I think there are a lot of learnings. There's no silver bullet, but there are a lot of learnings. Now having said that, actually, Japan has also been on a good run. I mean, it's had three quarters of very good volume growth, doing well on offsetting deflationary pressure. Again, it's a similar story. The team is very focused on a multiple category approach, innovation in the products, increasing the quality and quantity of the marketing, but always in parallel and in alignment with the bottler, where you've got to get better execution. Good marketing on its own is not going to get you the answers. It's got to be more and better marketing, along with more and better execution, and I think that's what you see. And to some extent, Western Europe, they kind of came new Coca-Cola European Partners came well out of the stables on the first quarter. I think the formula is going to be the same. More and better marketing, more and better execution and a multi-lane focus on categories and cranking out the learning, the trying stuff, the innovation and pushing ahead. And I think that's going to be something we'll continue to press across the developed markets. Now, turning to China, I think China, again, if I gave the impression it was all weather, that would unfair to the team on the ground in China and the system there. They've done a lot of work to address the big change in how the consumer responded to the economic circumstances in China. I think part of it is you know, it's a part of the world that's had such consistent growth rates over the last decade, but a little bit of a slowdown maybe caused some exaggerated pull-back on spending, so I think there is a little bit of stabilization coming through in the macros. We saw that. We've definitely taken action in the things we can control, not just in the commercial policies to strengthen the wholesaler and distributor network and working through the inventory problems, but also on the pricing and packaging. To give you one example, a very small example, but it's symptomatic of how fast China can change. If you go to the cafe channel in China, there are all the noodle shops up and down the streets. People go there at lunchtime. Last year, they were packed with people. This year, you go, they're a third empty. You go, okay, maybe the economy has slowed down. No, that's not what's happening. The explosion of online to offline ordering and the availability of lots of people on motorbikes to deliver stuff, and the apps and the aggregator apps to buy food has seen an explosion of ordering of online and delivery food, such that there is just as many people buying from these cafes, but sometimes in some parts of China, a third of it's being delivered to people, whether they be at work or as students. And so we've had to adapt our packaging. Having a returnable glass bottle in that cafe doesn't help you with off-line delivery. So we've had to revamp the packaging offer so that we're there with the right package to go where the consumer is going. And that's a micro example of the sorts of things we have to do China to adapt to how the market is changing and is contributing to stabilization. But it is, again, as I said, a country undergoing change in its economic model and that'll throw up new and different consumer behaviors to which we'll have to adapt.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Could you give us an update on the Philippines? You know, in listening to the Coca-Cola FEMSA results last night, it sounds like volumes were up there, margins are improving. It's one of those markets where it's been sort of a long-term project to get that turned around. Could you just give us a sense of sort of where you feel the Philippines are at this point and maybe what you've done to improve things there? Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. Hi, Bryan. It's James. Yeah, I mean, look, we've had a much better run in the Philippines in the last few quarters, actually, strong numbers the first three quarters of this year. Actually, last year was three very strong quarters as well. So I think since FEMSA's been in there, they've built on the work that BIG did. They've gone about fixing the fundamentals There were some fundamental structural stuff that still needed to be improved and I think they grasped the nettle in the early days. And we're starting to see the benefits of that coming through in the last six quarters. Again, it's not silver bullet stuff. Is not too complicated in the sense of it's been about adapting the price/package architecture. It's about some of the emphasis on some of the sparkling brands in the Philippines. There were some of the local brands that we de-emphasized and re-emphasized some of the more global brands and the stronger local brands, rebuilding and continuing to construct a more solid distributor network. Obviously, Philippines is complicated, given all the islands and the issue in moving product around, but I think they've kind of worked the system in terms of getting the thing nicely oiled in terms of the cogs so the product can get everywhere, backed up with a little more marketing and a little sharper focus on certain categories. And I think that's played through and I think the team on the ground has done a good job of taking the performance to a higher level.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge Research. Your line is now open.\nBrett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC: Good morning.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Brett.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Brett.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning, Brett.\nBrett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC: If we look back, we've seen you implement a pretty significant cost savings program, what I think we would describe as accelerated or accelerating M&A activity in your bottling system, yielding synergies. And now, there's talk in the system looking outside in seeking efficiencies in Japan. Are there more innovative ways that you're open to to help the system find funds to be more competitive?\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.: Hi, Brett. This is Muhtar. First, let me just say that over the last four, five years, we've been actually working really, really hard to reconfigure the Japanese bottling system. We had 13 bottlers, what, back five years, six years ago. And now, we're moving towards having 85% of the total business in Japan, which is, as you know, a very large business for us, under one roof. And I think that in itself first, without looking outside, without looking anywhere, is a huge re-architecture that is yielding substantial savings that we can re-deploy that into the route to market, into ways we actually get our products the most effective, efficient way to the customer and through the customer to the consumer in Japan. So regardless of any encouragement from the outside, we are on a track to end up in a very efficient, very 21st century bottling system, a consumer goods delivery system in Japan that is working well. Now, are there are other opportunities? And that is not just related to cost saving, and yes, there has been early, very early, discussions in Japan, can't say any more than that. And we will continue to look at opportunities to see if we could even make our Japanese system even stronger. But that's very early days, again, in terms of the level of discussions that have taken place.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Bill Chappell from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is now open.\nWilliam B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Bill.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Bill.\nTimothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nWilliam B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Just wanted to follow-up back on Steve Powers' question. I mean, there's definitely a noticeable kind of increase in talk about the still growth and investment at the last conference and on the call today. And just trying to understand, I mean, certainly understand there's an opportunity, but what that means for margins as we move, especially gross margins, going forward? Because I think it's still much lower gross margin and so do you expect margin degradation or has the mix of business, with tea or higher end-type products offset that so as we can look to kind of 2018, 2019, we don't see that kind of margin degradation?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. Let me say a couple of thoughts and then Kathy will give you some comments on the margin. Look, the stills, I think if I could say one thing, which is the stills is not a category. It's a combination of many different categories. And even those categories re-segment between premium, mainstream and more affordable. And so, what we are focused on doing as we invest in the stills business is, yes, growing in aggregate and top-line numbers, but we are being selective on focusing on those places where we think we can generate a better return in the long term. It's not a growth of bulk water. It's focused on where is the consumer demand, what's on-trend. And if you just pick out a couple of things that are on-trend, things like coconut waters of premium juices or premium ready-to-drink coffees, these are all very high revenue products. Kathy, do you want to say something about the margins?\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. So, hi, Bill. You are going to see some impact on margins, but mostly initially, because as we are going into these businesses, whether we are developing them internally or whether they're through bolt-on acquisitions, they do have a margin impact, but then as we get scale, as we continue to work on the supply chain, et cetera, we do start to improve the margin. So I would say it's an initial issue for margins. And then, over time, we are able to do things that will improve the margin impact. But initially, yes, as a category itself, a lot of these stills have higher cost of goods. They have higher revenue, but higher cost of goods, so that does impact margins.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJudy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning.\nJudy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I wanted to go back to China and ask a couple of follow-ups. So one is within the 2% growth in China, can you talk about sparkling versus still? And then, I think, James, we've seen certainly in that market, the premiumization is one of the key trends and just wanted to get a sense of how big you think that premium segment within NARTD in China is and what the growth rate is and kind of what you're doing to sort of tackle that consumer preference. And then separately, Kathy, the structural impact; obviously, fourth quarter is still a pretty big headwind. Is there any color you can give us as we think about 2017, sort of how much of the structural impact kind of lingers into 2017 and maybe even 2018? Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. James here. Look, I think it's important to say that the premium opportunity in China is big, but it's not as big as the mainstream opportunity. We are absolutely going to focus on investing in that premium opportunity. It's very much about the big cities, the white-collar. It's going to be also about some of the premium parts of the stills categories, and we're going to go after that. But in the end, the biggest mass of consumers, the biggest mass of disposable income will be in the mainstream. So it will have to be a combination of, yes, addressing the premiums, but also going after the mainstream with a greater affordability, expanding the distribution reach, upgrading the execution into the third tier cities in the rural areas. That is also going to be a big driver of our revenue. In terms of the categories, I think what has been going really well, by example, is we've taken an approach of premiumizing our water business in China. One of our most recent billion-dollar brands, (52:43) comes out of China effectively. And we're driving the business from a \u2013 in the end a 1 RMB price point to a 2 RMB price point. That's one of the biggest drivers of growth is the water at the 2 RMB. The places where we have a little tougher time is perhaps in the juice category, with sparkling in the middle. Again, when you look at what's growing in terms of the categories, what you do see is it maps quite closely to the consumer segments in terms of who's suffering and who's not suffering in terms of disposable income. The juices, that were kind of ambient, that were more going to the rural areas, are being hit a little harder. The premium waters, which are perhaps more the cities, have been doing well.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Hi, Judy. On your second question about the structural impact, so we will obviously give more guidance on 2017 later as we get closer to the beginning of the year, but I will say that, particularly in North America refranchising, the impact will be significant in 2017, because as we are moving to get all of the refranchising completed in 2017, we will be moving more than we have moved in all of 2015 and 2016 combined. So it will be a large impact in 2017. And we will work to give you all more color on that later in the year or early 2017. As far as 2018 is concerned, the refranchising will be done, but the impact will be basically the cycling of it, because, obviously, the timing of these transitions will be significant, not only to 2017, but also the impact it will have on 2018. And then, we have some costs that we have to get out in 2018 that we will be working to get out in early 2018 that would be basically a function of the refranchising as well. So we'll give you more color as time passes.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Muhtar Kent for closing remarks.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thank you, James, Kathy and Tim. We're working aggressively to evolve our sparkling strategy and expand our brand portfolio in order to address changing consumer preferences. And we're on track with transforming our company to a higher margin, higher return business, focused on building strong brands, enhancing customer value and leading a strong, dedicated global franchise system. Looking forward, we remain confident that the long-term dynamics of our industry are promising. And we absolutely believe that The Coca-Cola Company is well-positioned to deliver long-term value to our shareholders.

Today, I will touch briefly on a few key highlights in the quarter before handing off to James to provide a more detailed review of our operational performance. During the quarter, we continued our progress towards transforming our company to a higher margin and return business focused on our core value creation model of building strong brands, enhancing customer value, and leading our franchise system. Our continued focus on our five strategic initiatives enabled us to deliver another quarter of global value share gains, while delivering 3% organic revenue growth in a worsening macroeconomic environment. Importantly, our segmented revenue growth strategies drove three points of price/mix in the quarter. Further, our strong focus on productivity was instrumental in expanding operating profit margins and delivering our profit target. While we are pleased we accelerated our price/mix from 1% last quarter to 3% this quarter, our volume and top-line results still fell short of our expectations. This was largely due to a weakening demand in certain large emerging and developing markets, which also impacted our company-owned bottling operations' revenue growth. Within our Bottling Investments segment, positive pricing at our North American bottler was offset by challenges in our China bottling operations, resulting in even organic revenues for our company-owned bottling operations globally. However, our core franchise operations continued to perform well, growing organic revenues a full point ahead of our consolidated organic revenues and in line with our long-term targets. Despite weaker conditions in several emerging and developing markets, we continued to see a positive return on our marketing investments, with solid performance in key markets such as United States, Japan, and Mexico, which James will touch on in more detail. While the macroeconomic headwinds we are facing in these emerging and developing markets are cyclical in nature and not secular downturns, we're not expecting a material improvement in the remainder of the year, given the continuing volatility in the global economy. This outlook, coupled with where we are year-to-date, will make achieving our previous 4% to 5% organic revenue growth rate very challenging. Therefore, we are lowering our outlook for full-year consolidated organic revenue growth. James and Kathy will discuss this in greater detail later on the call. With that being said, we remain fully committed and confident in achieving our underlying profit target, despite this challenging environment. We're also confident that our core organic revenue growth will continue to outperform our consolidated organic revenue growth by a full point. Finally, we remain on track with our refranchising efforts, and we are confident we will complete those efforts by the end of 2017. Over the past few months, we successfully completed the Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa transactions, announced the transfer of certain territories in the United States to Arca Continental, UNITED venture and reached a new understanding with Coca-Cola FEMSA regarding joint value creation in Mexico and certain territorial expansion opportunities for company-owned bottling operations, which was announced just this morning. As we work through the comprehensive refranchising and near-term macro challenges, we will emerge a much stronger company with higher margins and returns and better positioned to deliver on our long-term growth targets. I will now hand the call over to James, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our operating performance.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Thank you, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. As Muhtar said, our consolidated volume and revenue results came in below our expectations. So let me first talk about where, why, and what we're doing about that. Our volume deceleration from the first quarter was concentrated in a few number of markets facing specific macroeconomic challenges; firstly, China, but also Argentina and Venezuela. The slowdown in our consolidated organic revenue versus our core organic revenue, which grew 4%, the consolidated slowdown was due to our Bottling Investments segment slowdown. It's the mechanical effect of owning both bottling operations as well as concentrate operations in certain challenged markets. BIG slowdown was principally driven by the challenges the industry, the broad industry, is facing in China. So let's start with China. And what are we doing about it? There are three factors impacting our performance in China. First, no question, the overall consumer environment is weakening due to the economy's economic transition. Secondly, as this is occurring, wholesalers are adjusting to lower expected sales growth and bringing down inventory levels, which has a whiplash effect on our bottler sales. Third, there are some category mix shifts occurring as different consumer segments respond to these new circumstances. For example, juice and juice drinks category is the weakest performing, whereas premium water is stronger and positive. So there's an opportunity here to both innovate with more premium products positioned for the higher income new mainstream consumer segment, as well as opportunities to address strong affordability needs across the rural and blue-collar areas. So I guess importantly, perhaps most importantly, what are we doing about it? Firstly, we've got a number of new premiumizing offers across multiple categories we compete in being launched. We're also focusing on better execution, particularly in the second tier and rural areas where they serve more of the mass consumer segment and upping the game in terms of affordable offerings. We are also rebasing the way we approach trade incentives to drive better performance with wholesaler and from our own distributors. Now, despite these actions to improve our business, we still expect our China operation to be under pressure for the remainder of the year. This is a key factor driving the organic revenue outlook, particularly the difference between consolidated and core, but I think it is worth finally making a note that we are keeping a long-term perspective with regard to China. We always knew that for a country as large as China, transitioning to a consumer-led economy was going to have its challenges. Those may have turned out to be more than we expected in the short-term; however, we absolutely believe in the long-term opportunity of this market of 1.4 billion consumers with relatively low beverage per capitas compared to the global average. Okay. So that's China. Let's move for a second to our core business. The core business, understood as the concentrate and the franchising business, this is where we grew organic revenues 4% for the first half of the year as segmented revenue growth strategies continue to drive positive results. Yes, some markets are tough, but others are doing very well. Let me start, perhaps, with the more challenging markets. I've already touched on China, so let me move to a couple of the other ones I mentioned earlier. Argentina, we believe that the Argentinian government is taking the right steps to secure its economic recovery, but this is resulting in a contraction in the near-term that accelerated in the second quarter, therefore impacting our business. In Venezuela, severe shortages in certain raw materials resulted in us temporarily suspending production at the bottling partners' plants during the quarter, clearly impacting the results. Additionally, Brazil, the challenges there are well-understood and we think will continue for the remainder of the year; however, we are focusing on key affordability packages and activating a strong Olympic marketing campaign in the coming weeks and months. We have lived through downturns before in emerging and developing markets and understand how to manage the business in these circumstances. It requires a disciplined approach to pricing relative to inflation and, of course, where necessary, aggressively moving to address consumer dynamics through adjusting the portfolio, both in terms of affordability and product innovation. But as I said earlier, not every market is under pressure. In markets with relatively stable economies, we are executing our strategies and seeing strong results. For example, in North America, we grew organic revenues 4% in the quarter, reflecting continued pricing initiatives for our sparkling business as well as the ongoing strength of our stills portfolio. In Mexico and Japan, we're delivering strong performance across our portfolio, driven heavily by innovation. And turning to some of the emerging markets, in Southeast Asia, we are growing volume double digits year-to-date behind strong integrated marketing and commercial initiatives across the core brands and key entry level packaging. Taken together, these results give us confidence that in stable markets where we increase our investments in marketing innovation, combined with improving marketplace execution, we can continue to deliver strong performance. Ultimately, we operate in over 200 countries, and there will always be some markets with macro challenges. Our ability to grow doesn't require macro perfection. In fact, even with this current broader macro adjustment phase in a good number of emerging markets, our segmented revenue growth strategies are enabling us to capture solid pricing of 3% year-to-date for our core operations on top of 1% volume growth. And we're using the productivity to prudently fund marketing where there is momentum and where we see a solid payback, but we're also holding on and making sure that we can use it to deliver strong underlying margin expansion. These actions have enabled us to grow underlying profit before tax in line with our expectations for the first half of the year, and despite more challenging conditions than we initially expected. So let me conclude by saying we are confident in our growth strategies. We continue to push in markets where we see success and proactively address those markets that are more challenged, of course, while always keeping an eye on the long-term. So with that, let me hand over to Kathy to take you through the numbers.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to touch quickly on our financial performance in the quarter before providing our full-year outlook. Starting at the top line, our organic revenue growth was impacted about a point by our segment mix, as our Bottling Investments segment grew slower than our core business. At gross profit, our comparable margin declined 20 basis points due to currency and structural headwinds. Excluding the effect of these items, our underlying gross margin expanded over 100 basis points, driven by solid pricing, a slightly favorable cost environment, productivity and segment mix. Our comparable operating margin improved about 15 (14:31) basis points. Similar to gross margin, currency and structural headwinds impacted our operating margin. Excluding the effect of these items, our underlying operating margin increased about 180 basis points in the quarter, due to gross margin expansion, as well as the timing of productivity savings and certain expenses. Now, turning to outlook, as Muhtar mentioned, we are revising our full-year top line target. For the full year, we now expect 3% organic revenue growth. With that said, we are confident our strategies will deliver stronger organic growth for our core business. And we are maintaining our full-year underlying profit target as we continue to manage our business. Therefore, we expect to deliver comparable currency neutral ex-structural income before tax growth of 6% to 8%, in line with our long-term target. During the first half of the year, we generated strong underlying operating leverage. Consistent with our previously-provided guidance, we expect this to moderate as we begin to cycle more difficult comparisons in the back half of this year. Coca-Cola European Partners closed about a month earlier than we estimated in our previous structural guidance. And we continue to move faster with our refranchising efforts in North America. Therefore, we are updating our full-year structural outlook. We now expect a six to seven point structural headwind on net revenue and a four point headwind on income before tax. Our currency outlook remains the same as our previous guidance, a two to three point headwind on net revenue and an eight to nine point headwind on income before tax. So taking all of this into consideration, we expect full-year comparable EPS to decline 4% to 7%. And there are a few phasing items to consider when constructing your models. Our fourth quarter has two additional days, as compared to last year, which will result in stronger top line growth in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. In addition, the two additional days in the fourth quarter, coupled with what we are cycling in SG&A in the third quarter of last year, means operating leverage will skew strongly into the fourth quarter. Therefore, we expect virtually all of our growth in comparable currency neutral ex-structural income before tax to come in the fourth quarter. We expect structural items to be a nine point headwind on net revenue and a three point headwind on income before tax in the third quarter. Finally, we expect currency to be a two point headwind on net revenue and a two to three point headwind on income before tax in the third quarter. In closing, our strategies are working in key markets. We are on track to deliver over $600 million in productivity this year, and we continue to accelerate our refranchising efforts. While our expectations for top line growth have softened, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our profit target this year. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Steve Powers of UBS. Your line is open.\nStephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Hi. Good morning. Maybe we could start with a question for James on China mainly, because it sounds like that market was the biggest driver of the gap between your reported 3% organic growth and the 4% core number that you that cited, and I'm guessing it cost you roughly a point of unit case volume in the quarter as well. So first, is that right? But more importantly, is there a way to parse how much of the adverse impact is tied to the macro slowing, which I think is more likely to persist, versus supply chain corrections and wholesaler inventory de-stockings, which might hopefully be more transitory? I guess I'm really trying to assess just how much of a headwind China was in Q2 and then how severe you expect the ongoing headwind to be, acknowledging the improvement initiatives that you called out? And then finally, do the issues facing BIG in China impede, at all, your ability to refranchise that market on time and on favorable terms? Thanks.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Okay. Morning, Steve. So, okay, let me try and get to China, and let me start from the top and work downwards, if I may. I mean, firstly, it's clear that, when you look at The Coke Company, almost half our revenue comes from bottling versus the other half comes from concentrate and franchise, but given, as you all know, that a bottling business comes with four to five times more revenue per drink sold and the accompanying cost, any effect on the revenue of the bottler is going to have a magnified impact on revenue and much less on profits, which is part of this dynamic. So in China, it's our largest international bottling operation. We own bottlers that are roughly 20% of the global business, but the biggest one outside the U.S. is China. So that's where it's coming from. And it's the mechanical impact of being hit in China, where we own about a third of the system, that's creating that whole difference between the 3% and the 4%. And what we've assumed in our outlook, just to be more confident, clear in our confidence going forward, is we have not really assumed that China is going to get better in the rest of the year. So if it did, that would be great. But we are assuming it's not in terms of our outlook and guidance, but obviously we're working to try and make it better. Now, as I said, as you kind of tried to split the difference, what's changing is both the consumer and the supply chain. I think in round numbers from a revenue perspective, you've got about half the impact coming from the consumer and half coming from the supply chain. What's happening on the consumer, you can see is it in the scanned Neilson, and the non-scanned Neilson is probably a bit worse than the scanned Neilson in terms of slowdown in sell-out to the consumers of all types of FMCG categories, so it is a kind of a broad-based consumer slowdown. Within that, from a beverage point of view, you've got juice drinks and juices, which were kind of more for the rural areas and blue-collar, they are down double digits in terms of revenue from a consumer point of view. Something like Coke is down low single digits and premium waters is growing. So there's a shift in the category mix going on, which is also actually impacts revenue because juice drink prices tend to be higher than sparkling or water, so that doesn't flow through to profitability. So there is a kind of rebasing going on in there. But as I said, about half of it's the supply chain, the whiplash effect of the de-stocking by the customers and that, as you say, is likely to be a much shorter-term impact, but, again, we're working on it, but we're not including an improvement in that in our outlook, although clearly, we want to get focused on it and get it to work. I agree with you. The consumer thing will take a little more time to come back, which is why we're focused on our kind of the game plan we know that works in downturns, where we focus on affordability, on premiumizing for those parts of the country, like the premium metro areas, and bringing out new products for them. And that way, we believe we can gain value share, which we continue to do, in China, so that we're set up as the consumer starts recovering. So about half and half and we believe that the consumer will come back and the supply chain will sort itself out in the relative short-term in the rest of this year. Now, with regard to the refranchising, obviously, can't really comment on the M&A, but I would say that we and our partners all believe in the long-term potential of the China market. We're very excited and, as I said, because a large part of what's happening in the short-term is de-stocking in inventory. Everyone's looking past that and looking to the long-term, and I think there's still good motivation and animation by everyone to get the deal done. And we'll obviously, from our point of view, make sure we do it on the right terms for ourselves. And they'll be looking for the right terms for them, but we still think it's the right deal for everyone and with a good likelihood of getting done.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Morning.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Morning.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I wanted to better understand why you maintain the FX-neutral income before taxes guidance, despite the negative full-year top-line revision. I'm assuming part of that is just the top-line weakness is in lower margin areas, so probably less of a margin impact, but can you give us more detail on why the local FX profit goals have not been as impacted by top-line weakness and how much visibility you have on the profit side and any leverage you have to protect downside if macros weaken further?\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Dara, I'll just comment first and then maybe ask Kathy and James if they want to add anything. But certainly you've answered part of it by saying that, yes, revenue challenges are coming from those areas that have much lower margins, number one, for sure. And then, secondly, productivity efforts are continuing that's driving the margin expansion in quarter two. Kathy mentioned the significant margin expansions that we have achieved. And I think productivity efforts are going to continue. And then, finally, I think there's also a mix. Some of our better markets, more profitable markets, are doing well, like the United States and Mexico and also in the Far East and Japan, so there's a mix issue. And then, finally, the commodities continue to be pretty benign in terms of the outlook. So those are the things that play into all together, but primarily, the one that you mentioned, which is the revenue challenges are coming from much lower margin areas in terms of our business. Kathy, anything to add?\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No, I would say that those are the reasons, Muhtar. I would say probably you are picking up the fact that we do have more difficult comps in the back half for some of the things that Muhtar mentioned, but we are confident that we will still be on our guidance.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, we're overall very confident that the changes in marketing, the strategy on innovation pipeline, the One Brand strategy, which is just at the beginning, the promotions that we have in store in the summer around the Olympics, the price/mix expansion that we've experienced in quarter two, all of that we feel play very into the equation and feel, give us confidence in the back half that there are likely more challenging comps in the back half that we can actually cycle them and achieve them going forward and feel confident that we can.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj, Bernstein. Your line is open.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Just a couple of clarifications; one is on back to guidance, and, look, if comparable currency neutral income, excuse me, before taxes is still in the 6% to 8% range for 2016 relative to Q1 guidance, so you gave that same guidance in Q1, and the structural move only went from negative 3% to 4%, to negative 4%, so, like a 50 basis points change there, currency is still a 8% to 9% drag. I guess I'm confused about what's driving the EPS guidance effectively down by two points at the midpoint. So what's going on between profit before tax and the EPS to drag it down another two points? Because the only thing that seems like it's changing is the structural, in what you've told us, relative to Q1. That's my first question. I have another one, if you permit me.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay, Ali. So basically, it's in the rounding. So, yes, we gave comparable currency neutral guidance on EPS of 4% to 6%, and that was comparable currency neutral. So then when you either take out another rounded point of structural, so it rounded down, but it's really is a rounding point of structural. And then you take out currency, that gets you basically in the actual numbers, if you take out only a point of structural, gets you to 3% to 6%, but then it's in the rounding, so that's how we came up with the 4% to 7%.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: If you start with the 4% to 6%, you back out the currency and you back out a rounded point of structural, that gets you down to your 3% to 6% and then it's really in the rounding to get to the 4% to 7%.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. I have trouble getting there. Maybe I'll follow up. I still see it being kind of an incremental point somewhere in there. But basically you're saying there's no change in the gap between PBT and EPS. Tax isn't changing. There's no other things in there, right?\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No. That's correct.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Maybe I'll follow up just about the rounding point to help me with my math.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: The second piece is in the press release and, James, in some of your comments, I think, you said, look, we are, from the release, \"reassessing local market initiatives\". Can you tell us a little bit more about what you mean exactly, so where? Is it all about China, perhaps Argentina? And is advertising spend as a percentage of sales still up for you in the quarter? And does it impact, in any way, this confidence we had a year ago, six months ago, about really good ROIs on the marketing spend? Thanks.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Sure. I think perhaps that's two questions in the second question there, Ali, but let me have a go. Look, in terms of reassessing the actions, that's both on the places with momentum and the places that are suffering. There are parts of the business that are growing strongly, whether that's at one end of the spectrum like the U.S. and Japan, where we've got good momentum. And the U.S. grew organically 4% in the quarter. Japan is growing well. We are increasing the amount of spend as we see the tailwinds and the effectiveness of the marketing, the innovation, the execution. So we're reallocating money to the places that have momentum. And that's on the developed end, like the U.S. and Japan. It's also on the emerging end, like Indonesia and the Philippines and places like that. So we're going where we see the opportunity to get the biggest bang for the buck. Now, we're taking some of the money from those markets that are under most pressure, and, in those places, we're prioritizing. Yes, there's still some advertising, but we're doing innovations and we're doing execution and very importantly, doing affordability. So the most extreme example perhaps is Venezuela, where there was no sugar. And we've actually doubled-down on really driving Coke with zero sugar in Venezuela with kind of a full red One Brand look. So there are places where we are adjusting to the need that just because you advertise, doesn't mean people are going to buy if it's an affordability problem. And I think China is a good example of where affordability is in there as well, and I think I've talked a bit about China. But the game plan that we've used in those emerging markets under pressure, we're really (30:44) rolling out, so that reassessing is moving some top line money to those with momentum and doubling-down on execution and affordability and innovation in those pressured markets. And that kind of goes a bit to the advertising. Advertising is up this quarter as we continue to see the value of advertising as part of the marketing mix in combination with innovation and execution. It's only when you get all of those together that you really get the best returns, and we always look to make sure that all three are there. Otherwise, we'll end up wasting our money. So we're out there and we're pushing ahead with it. And I think what we always have said is that advertising takes some time to work. So, for example, the One Brand strategy that we announced in the first quarter, we started the rollout, the latest iteration of the graphics went into Mexico a couple of months ago. That sort of marketing innovation takes time to build up an effect. So we'll keep pressing away with the investment and keep assessing. It's too early to call the success. We'd do that towards the end of the year, but we are focused on making that work.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Ali, just to add to the point of ROIC on the marketing, when you take into account the price/mix expansion going from 1% to 3% in the quarter, when you take into account the core business that we have, which is really the company that's emerging out of this very rapid transformation and refranchising, is growing still at a point ahead of the total company currently consolidated number, which is at 4%, which is within our sort of long-term growth target that we've espoused to and talked about. I think that's also not maybe a micro metric, but certainly an important metric to consider in terms of the payback on also all the activity. And we are still in the early days of the One Brand strategy. It just launched in Mexico a few months ago, just launched in Europe and parts of Europe. So again, we feel confident that that is going to continue to work in our benefit, coupled with the marketing that James talked about.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I look forward to it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nNik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah, thanks for the question. Just two quick ones for me, there is a lot of stuff going on at Coke right now, international organization management, refranchising at an accelerated pace. I'm just curious if you can give us some clarity on maybe how much of the volume issue this quarter was partly related to disruption. And then, just on the price/mix, I mean, it's pretty good number. We've seen a kind of 3% price/mix a couple of times over the past two years. Just curious on what you think the sustainability of that magnitude of price/mix is as we think out the next one to two years.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Sure. Let me start. I don't think any of the unit case pressure in the second quarter was due to the reorganization. I think the trends on unit cases, and let me just throw out another way of looking at it, has started at the beginning of the year. I think it's probably one of the few times we've seen the developed and our developing countries grow volume and actually seen the emerging markets decline in aggregate. I know we only put out the numbers by groups. But if you look at developed companies and developing economies, you see volume growth in both those blocks of countries. So in the end, our business, when you take the segmented roles, we've got volume growth and price/mix growth in developed and developing countries, which is very positive in terms of the long-term trajectory of the business. North America has got multi-years of making that work at the revenue line, so that's very strong. The volume weakness is all in the emerging markets, and it's all concentrated in a few of the emerging markets. It's big in some of those markets, but it's very concentrated. And the people then on the country levels are all largely still the same and working on these problems. So hopefully, that gives you a little insight on where the volume weakness is, but I don't think it has anything to do with the reorganization. In fact, I think the reorganization is helping us bring some refreshed views and some experience on what to do in emerging market weakness going forward in the downhill this year and into the future. And then on the price/mix, 3% is a good result. I think we've always talked about our long-term growth model calls for 4% to 6% revenue growth. And we see a balanced split between volume and price/mix into the future. So that gives you a 2% to 3% for price/mix as the component of the long-term growth. And also, 3% is a strong result. Long may it live. For the long-term growth model, we're looking for 4% to 6% in a balanced way.\nNik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel. Your line is open.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Morning.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Two questions, one on Europe specifically, James, I guess I am surprised Spain was down in the quarter. You cited weather, but it's been doing pretty well, so what is going on in Spain beyond weather? And can you give us any color on Great Britain, because Europe overall had a nice sequential \u2013 or at least did better than where consensus was, so looking for some color there? And then, Kathy, on FX, really no change in your FX view for the year. Can you remind us how you're hedged on some key currencies and how that might play out, the duration of those hedges and what those currencies are?\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Sure. On Europe, I think Europe got a little bit better this quarter. There are things weighing on our business. I'm not a big fan of calling out weather as a driver of performance. The weather occurs, for good or for bad, all around the world. Now, in the case of Spain and also France, at kind of that end of the Mediterranean, it was particularly poor in the middle part of the quarter. So that's really what's driving what's going on in the Spanish business and also it impacted the French business. So we see Europe getting a little bit better. I mean, we had some good results out of Germany. And, as you said, some sequential improvement out of GB cycling out of some of the supply chain problems and as they got fixed, that came out of the first quarter. So we see that starting to improve going forward, but I think I hate calling out the weather, but I think that's really the reason in Spain, and France. And I think we'll start to see those businesses get better. Now, it is worth saying that we've got a lot of good programs in Europe, but the recent tragic events in Belgium, in France, and recently in Germany, do weigh on consumer sentiment and consumer behavior. They go out less and we have strong on-premise businesses, in fact, particularly in Spain. And that is being dragged down as people respond to some of these tragic events by, perhaps, staying at home a little more. Now, that hopefully will get better in time as the security situation improves, but I don't want to get into weather and global events. I think the business in Europe can get better. We've got a lot of launches coming up and we've got some strong programs. I think Europe can continue to perform.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. And quick follow-up on that specific to Spain, what does your work say about underlying health of the business, either because of performance in July? You're saying it sequentially should get better but I'm kind of wondering what's underlying that view. How are you getting to that?\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: I mean, I'm not going to comment on the beginning of July from a volume perspective. I would note that I think July was the biggest-ever month for Spain last year, so they've got some tough comps to cycle. They had a record summer last year. The underlying business in Spain is improving. Firstly, the economy is getting better. Secondly, the supermarket environment in terms of rational pricing and some of the activities is getting better. And the Spanish bottler made a massive investment going into last year to reinvest in returnable glass, which is one of the preeminent places in the world where this is true in the on-premise accounts. And that's starting to show good results, notwithstanding the weather and the security impacts in the year-to-date. And now, with the CCEP deal closed and management fully focused on leveraging the best of the marketing, the best of the innovation and really doubling-down on the execution, I think we'll start to see improvements in Spain and the other CCEP territories.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Excellent. Great. Thank you, James.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And on currency, so, yes, we did not change our guidance this quarter. We've had a lot of movement in some key currencies, but basically they are offsetting each other. Given the volatility that we've seen kind of across the portfolio, some currencies are getting better, like Brazil. Some are staying the same or getting worse, like a Mexico. Our hard currencies, we are hedged 100%, basically, and then we hedge our emerging market currencies on a short-term basis as kind of opportunistically. With 2017 being fully hedged for our hard currencies and, obviously, our exposure then would be basically in our emerging market currencies.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So you said you're fully hedged for hard currencies for calendar 2017, for the duration of 2017?\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. For 2017, that's correct.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Great. Okay. Thank you.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJudy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Morning.\nJudy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I wanted to go back and follow up on the price/mix question. And clearly, the 3% is a good number, but obviously you're benefiting from pretty high inflationary markets. So I just wanted to better understand how much of this is really coming from your segmentation, the revenue segmentation strategy versus the price growth that you're seeing in inflationary markets, so any granularity that you can give us would be helpful. And then a little bit related to that, I think the flat volume growth that you've seen this quarter, I can't recall the last time you had this kind of volume trend. So, again, how much of this is really a function of your strategy to focus more on revenue and not chase unprofitable volume growth and if this is something that you'd be willing to accept for some period of time?\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Judy, good morning, again. It's Muhtar. First, I think James talked in detail about where the volume shortfalls were coming from and specifically related to certain large emerging markets that drove that number, and so that's related to Brazil. That's related to China being the large ones, but also Russia. All of those emerging markets that used to have better disposable incomes, better macro conditions, basically drove some of that. And going forward, certainly, we expect some improvement in that area. So that's number one. Number two, I think important to note that, again, mentioned that the developed markets grew and developing markets grew volume and were ahead of the total company number, which was flat and ahead of emerging markets. That itself will tell you that certainly the price/mix coming from those markets and then the total geographic mix that coupled with that, is something that was instrumental in driving our price/mix number in the way it landed in the quarter. So all of those factors and algebras, all the algebra coming together is what made that, the country mix coming out of that, the geographic mix and then the volume, coupled with the pricing that we got. And today, when you look at our U.S. business, with 4% organic revenue growth in North America, that tells you that that is in, certainly, in very much in the upper quartile of all large consumer businesses in the country. We are doing very, very well. Japan performed well. Again, Mexico performed very well in terms of the volume and pricing combined, driving the total number of price/mix. So all of that really goes to explain and hopefully answers your question on that. Anything to add, James, there? Okay.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: On the price/mix question, Judy, so we did have this quarter, price/mix was positive across in all of our groups. Yes, primarily driven by Latin America and inflationary pricing, but also operational pricing in EAG, but then it was offset by some segment mix coming from the Bottling Investments segment. So, as James said, pricing of 2% to 3% is what we expect and what we would think would be very good pricing and in line with our segmentation strategy, even though EAG was probably more than kind of out of its normal range at this point, but North America, pricing is still very strong. So we do believe in the segment strategy and the 2%, 3% is kind of what we expect going forward.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And then, the sparkling segment, just to finalize that, continues to be a segment of the non-alcoholic, ready-to-drink, where consumers continue to spend a very large amount of money and in terms of consumer spend and in terms of the dollar value, is still very, very healthy. And that's why it gives us confidence looking into the future about what we're doing in terms of the segmented revenue growth strategy and in terms of the marketing approach and the One Brand strategy in taking the lion's share of that spend going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Morning.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just two quick ones, one, for James, just you've talked a lot I think on this call about some of the short-term things that have affected organic sales and kind of changes, I guess, sequentially in the environment since the start of the year. Can you just update us on kind of what your view for the industry forecast is, maybe not so much for this year but just over the medium-term, has there been any change in terms what you think the non-alcohol ready-to-drink beverage industry is going to grow over the medium-term? And then, second question, just you had mentioned Coke FEMSA earlier and it looks like you've got an agreement with them to negotiate on a preferred basis. Could you just sort of expand upon that a little bit? Are they exclusively looking at some of these territories or is it a matter that they're just getting a first look? Thank you.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Sure. I think in your first question, I mean, our medium-term outlook for the industry hasn't really changed. We're still expecting robust growth in the industry in the long-term, driven by the disposal income, urbanization, the middle class, innovation. We see these things expanding. Now, we've talked about that being in the 5% sort of ballpark and then probably in the next few years, talked about it being in the 4%. So we do see it coming back over time. But we do see industry growth slightly moderated in the short-term, as we talked a little bit about in some of the previous conferences. Now, you did ask the question, which kind of seemed short to me because I think I would \u2013 give me a second to just re-underline from our point of view, the biggest mechanical impact in the quarter and the year-to-date is this asymmetry between where we own bottlers and where it is less than 20% of the volume or about 20% of the volume versus being in 200 countries. If you part the bottling side, and just look at the core concentrate and franchise, we're running organic at 4% and we're meeting our profit guidance. So we're not trying to say small ups and downs in the macro economies is what should buffet us every quarter, we just need to deal with those things. I just think there's this one asymmetrical effect of the bottling thing, which is kind of important, which is affecting the number. But I don't want to give the impression we're seeing a massive \u2013 or trying to signal a deterioration in outlook for the concentrate and franchise business. Now, with regard to Coke FEMSA, yeah, we talked about looking at some territories on a preferred basis. I'm not going to get into exactly how that means in terms of what preferred means versus exclusive, et cetera, but they're our biggest bottling partner. We have a very strong relationship. We've made an agreement on how we're going to create more value together in Mexico and how they can look to participate in some of the refranchising of the territories that we own in bottling and we're very excited about doing more stuff together.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And we'll take our last question from Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.\nVivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the question.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi.\nVivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: So as I look at some of the disclosure in the press release, it seems like you've broken from convention a little bit, a lot less brand disclosure, Trademark Coca-Cola only called out in North America. You guys aren't breaking out sparkling and stills anymore. So I'm just curious if we can get a little more color on Trademark Coke outside of North America and China, and also whether the change in convention speaks to a broader shift in terms of how you're thinking about balancing volumes across your portfolio? Thank you.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, I think, yes, I mean, in part, please read into this that we're moving the business to more of a revenue focus. I mean, absolutely under the heading everything communicates, that is part of what we're trying to say. We believe in our segmented revenue approach. It's not that we have forgotten about volume or don't believe it's an underlying driver in the long-term, particularly in the emerging markets of what's going to create the business over the long-term, but as we look at places like North America and some of the other developed markets, clearly, we're going after more of a revenue strategy that's driven by smaller packages, by some pricing actions, so we do want to call out that perhaps the best way to think about health of the business going into the future is the revenue growth. And that's where I think what we're trying to say is, not just the beverage industry, the sparkling industry category and brand Coke all remain healthy in terms of revenue growth. All three of those are growing revenue globally, and we continue to see good attraction both in the U.S. in terms of sparkling revenue growth and internationally in terms of sparkling revenue growth.\nVivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I would like to turn the call back to Muhtar Kent for closing remarks.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, James, Kathy and Tim. I'd say we're on track with transforming The Coca-Cola Company to one that is even more focused on our core value creation model of building strong brands, enhancing customer value and leading our franchise system, the transformation that will result in significantly higher margin and returns. The macro headwinds are putting pressure on our top line, but they're cyclical in nature and we're taking the right actions that give us confidence that we will emerge a much stronger company, while we also deliver our profit targets. We remain confident that the long-term dynamics of our industry are promising, and we absolutely believe that The Coca-Cola Company is well-positioned to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning."}, {"symbol": "KO", "quarter": 1, "year": 2016, "date": "2016-04-20 13:45:04", "content": "Executives: Timothy K.

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Muhtar.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Eighteen months ago, I communicated a clear five-point plan to reinvigorate our growth and increase profitability. In February, we reported a successful transition year in 2015, where we made tangible progress on our plan and delivered the full-year expectations we laid out. I'm pleased to report that in the quarter, the first quarter of 2016, we took another positive step in the macro environment that continues to be challenging. Today, I will touch briefly on a few key highlights in the quarter before handing off to James to provide a more detailed review of our operational performance. We're in the midst of transforming The Coca-Cola Company to one that is even more focused on our core value creation model of building and supporting strong brands, enhancing customer value and leading our franchise system. During the first quarter, our continued focus on our five strategic initiatives enabled us to gain value share and deliver positive top-line growth with underlying margin expansion. With the first quarter behind us, we see the challenging global environment continuing, but we remain committed to our full-year targets we laid out in February for both the top and bottom-line performance. From a highlights perspective, we continued to execute our strategic initiatives. In the first quarter, we unveiled our new global one brand marketing strategy for Trademark Coca-Cola under the Taste the Feeling campaign, which is elevating system engagement with our employees, bottling partners and customers. The initial consumer response is encouraging and positive. Additionally, we added to our portfolio of fast-growing still beverages. We closed our Chinese plant-based protein acquisition of Culiangwang in March. We also invested in Chi, the leading juice and value-added dairy company in Nigeria, Africa's largest economy. Both transactions are further proof points of how we are strengthening our leading stills position, effectively responding to evolving consumer preferences. Finally, we are accelerating our global refranchising efforts. In North America, we continued to make progress against our stated goal of refranchising 100% of our bottling operations by the end of 2017. Including the territories announced this morning, we have transferred or signed agreements on almost two-thirds of the U.S. territories we originally acquired from CCE. Looking outside of North America to Western Europe, our Coca-Cola European Partner's transaction remains on track to close by the end of the second quarter. In Africa, the regulatory approval process continues. The South Africa Competition Commission has recommended for the Competition Tribunal to approve the Cola-Cola Beverages Africa merger with certain conditions. The Tribunal is set to meet in May to review the pending transaction. In summary, we recognize that we still have much work to do, but we have defined a clear path to transform the company and we're making consistent progress to create long-term value for our shareowners. The Coca-Cola Company is becoming stronger, more efficient and more focused on our core strengths of marketing and brand-building, customer value creation and leading our franchise bottling system. We're making progress implementing our disciplined global revenue growth management strategy. We're also building new growth opportunities with still and sparkling brands that we develop internally, we acquire from the outside and we invest in through partnerships. And our franchise bottling system is also getting strong, faster, more nimble and more closely aligned. In short, my colleagues and I are getting up every single day with a fresh passion for doing the things that will create long-term sustainable value. I'll now hand the call over to James, who's going to provide you with a more detailed look at our operating performance in the first quarter.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. From an industry perspective, we gained global value share in NARTD beverages in the quarter, with increases in both sparkling and still beverages worldwide. We gained value share in all but one of the subcategories in stills, where there, we maintained value share. We delivered 2% unit case volume growth. Our solid performance in many of our developed markets was partially offset by challenges in emerging markets suffering from the worst of the macro slowdown. This had a disproportionate effect on sparkling volume growth, as the non-alcoholic beverage industry in many of these markets is more weighted towards sparkling beverages. Consolidated price/mix grew 1%, cycling 3%. Our solid underlying pricing was partially offset by one point of segment mix. We accelerated our price/mix across every operating segment, except Asia Pacific, versus the first quarter lap. Given the geographic footprint of our own Bottling Investments Group, our consolidated price/mix was lower. Given the scale of our pending refranchising, as you consider the sustainability of our disciplined pricing strategy, I think it's helpful to exclude BIG and focus instead on our core business, which delivered two points of global price realization. Results were also impacted by one less day in our fiscal quarter compared to the same period last year, which reduced organic revenue growth by roughly one point. As a result, we delivered 2% organic revenue growth, including one point headwind from one less day. In the quarter, structurally adjusted comparable currency neutral income before tax grew a solid 9%, with the underlying margin expansion reflecting our focus on productivity, as well as the timing of operating expenses. Notably, this expansion occurred alongside the continued growth in our marketing investments. Now, to describe more clearly our operating performance, let me briefly describe our results in three groupings of our markets. First, in markets where our strategies are in place and being executed fairly well, we are seeing strong results. This cluster is led by North America, Latin America, also includes Japan and India. Here, strong marketing, disciplined revenue management and improving execution are driving results. For example, specifically in North America, we delivered: 2% organic revenue growth, with one less day; three points of price realization, led by 3% sparkling price/mix and good operating leverage in the quarter. North America also grew value share again this quarter, and continued to successfully implement its accelerated refranchising program. Latin America delivered double-digit organic revenue growth, due to a strong focus on consumer and customer segmentation, despite worsening conditions in Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina. In Mexico, brand investments, including new products, such as Del Valle Nada (9:57), a sparkling fruit drink, as well as Ciel mineral water and Ciel flavored water, helped increase unit volume by 5%, with growth across all major categories. Our Japan business unit had a very strong start to the year, supported by several recent innovations, such as I LOHAS Peach, an extension of our premium water brand, and our premium priced Georgia Coffee bottle/can. We also leveraged innovation from China, launching Lemon+C, which has seen strong early results. These hit products enabled our value share to outperform volume share, as they skew to higher revenue, single-serve packaging. And finally, India; here, we delivered strong performance in the quarter, due to the rapid scaling of a new price/pack architecture across sparkling and juice segments, coupled with brand marketing and execution efforts. In addition, we expanded our still beverage portfolio in India with the launch of VIO, our latest value-added dairy beverage. These positive results give us confidence our strategies are working. While we are making progress in these markets, we also recognize there's more work to be done, and the opportunity for improvement in these good performing markets continues to be significant. The second group is comprised of markets where we are taking action to positively transform our business for the future. Here, I would include Europe, where we continue to make progress to the establishment of our newly-integrated Western European bottler. And here, several key markets performed very well, led by Spain, up 3%; Germany, up 1%; and in the Central and Southern European business unit, we grew volume 2%. We look forward to improving performance in Europe as the year progresses. A second transition market is our African business, where we are taking steps to strengthen our bottling business through the creation of new Coca-Cola Beverages Africa bottler. As Muhtar mentioned, we are also taking steps to diversify our brand portfolio through our investment in Chi. And we continue to improve our execution in key markets on the Continent, as exemplified by improving performance in South Africa and Nigeria, where we grew unit case volume 7% and 13%, respectively. There's a final bunch of markets where we face clear macro headwinds in 2016. Russia and Brazil continue to be challenging. China's transition to a consumer-led economy is putting pressure on commodity-dependent emerging and developing markets. The lower oil price continues to weigh on the Middle East and other oil-driven economies. And while Argentina is taking the right steps to secure its economic recovery, short-term results are challenging. So let me refer to a few of these markets. In China, we are adjusting our plans to reflect these realities. China's macro environment was challenging in 2015, and that continued to be so in the first quarter. While the economic slowdown is not new, the degree to which the NARTD industry was impacted this past quarter was worse than expected. Key success factors going forward require focusing on both affordability and premiumization through segmented growth strategies. The more premium segments continued to grow in China, as consumers who purchase these products are relatively insulated from broader economic issues. We are working to increase our premium offerings, like sleek cans and Schweppes+C, in high value channels. At the same time, however, we continue to evolve our price/pack architecture to deliver affordable options in both single-serve and multi-serve packages to ensure we can capture key occasions and recruit new consumers. While the top line has been challenging, our initiatives have enabled us to gain both value and volume share in China in the quarter. Turning to Brazil, here, we are segmenting our price/pack architecture to provide packages at key affordable price points while delivering and driving pricing to cover inflation. This strategy enabled us to gain volume share during the quarter. And finally, in Russia, we gained value share, driven by good marketing and promotional activities, with a focus on premium sparkling beverages and juice. Given the volatility in these markets, we are proactively managing our investments, keeping an eye towards the long term, but ensuring our near-term investments have the right payback. The challenging macro environment is also a key reason why productivity is critical. We remain on track to deliver more than $600 million in productivity savings this year, enabling us to fund our brand and growth investments while covering cost inflation and driving margin expansion. We are delivering these savings through a disciplined process that involves our entire leadership team and associates. Ultimately, it's about building a culture that is focused on getting better every day, whilst also improving the employee experience. This quarter, the results of our ongoing efforts were evident in supporting the underlying strong operating margin expansion. Before I hand over to Kathy, let me conclude by saying we are resolutely focused on evolving our growth strategies and transforming our business to deliver sustainable shareholder value. With the challenges around the world, we will focus on what we can control in order to deliver solid revenue growth and strong underlying operating margin expansion through the effective management of our portfolio, price/mix and productivity efforts. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Kathy.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to touch upon a few areas of our financial performance in the quarter before providing our full-year outlook. Starting at the top line, as James mentioned, our 2% organic revenue growth was impacted by one less day in the quarter as well as by our segment mix, as our Bottling Investments Group grew at a slightly slower rate than our core business. Let me take a moment to explain what we mean by segment mix and why the impact will be more pronounced in 2016 and 2017 until we have finished our previously-announced refranchising actions. Starting in the first quarter, we revised our operating segments so that our company-owned bottling operations in North America are now reported within our Bottling Investments Group. This greatly increases the relative size of the Bottling segment to the rest of our geographic segments. Since our bottling operations earn significantly higher revenues per case than concentrate operations, slower growth among our company-owned bottling operations results in negative pressure on our consolidated price/mix, regardless of the underlying pricing in either the bottling operations or our core business. However, due to the relatively lower profitability of a bottling business, slower growth among our bottling operations has an opposite effect on our consolidated margins. At gross profit, our comparable margin declined, as we were impacted by currency headwinds, the effects from North America refranchising and the sale of our legacy energy brands to Monster. Excluding the year-over-year effect of these items, we would have seen gross margin expansion driven by a benign cost environment, benefits from productivity and segment mix. As you think about the downhill, keep in mind that the cost environment becomes more difficult to cycle in the second quarter and beyond, due to the timing of when commodity prices eased last year. Our comparable operating margin improved about 25 basis points on a consolidated basis. Similar to gross margin, currency headwinds, the North America refranchising and the sale of our legacy energy brands to Monster impacted our operating margins. Comparable currency neutral operating margins increased 140 basis points in the quarter. Excluding these effects, we achieved strong operating leverage in the quarter, driven by the benefits of our productivity initiatives, the timing of certain expenses and segment mix. Looking at our productivity initiatives, the first quarter benefited from the timing of when certain productivity initiatives were implemented last year. For example, the majority of the head count reductions began in April, with Europe's implementation closer to the mid-year. So the associated expense savings began in the second quarter. As you think about the remainder of this year, while we expect solid currency neutral ex-structural operating leverage, we expect some of these drivers to moderate as we begin to cycle more difficult comparisons. This was reflected in our previously-provided full-year guidance. Let me stop here and touch briefly on an ongoing structural impact to provide additional clarity based on some of the questions I have received from you. At CAGNY, we noted that by the time we complete our refranchising, we will see significant increases in both gross and operating margins. While that is the case, I want to remind you that until we begin to increase the transfer of our production operations in North America, the existing refranchising of the distribution business actually has a dilutive effect to both gross and operating margins. Given that we do not expect the sale of production assets to significantly increase until 2017, our margins will continue to be affected by this dynamic this year. Moving to cash flow, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations before making a nearly $0.5 billion contribution to our pension plans. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we expect our cash flow growth rate to be more in line with our earnings growth rate. For 2016, we increased our annual dividend by 6% to $1.40 per share, our 54th consecutive annual dividend increase. Our net share repurchases during the quarter totaled approximately $150 million. For the full year, we expect to achieve the $2 billion to $2.5 billion range that we communicated during our last earnings call. Turning to outlook, the first quarter reflected more challenging operating environments in markets like China and Brazil. We see that our strategies are working, however, in key markets like North America, Japan and India. Further, our strategies allow us to scenario plan to adjust to market dynamics. Therefore, we are maintaining our currency neutral outlook we previously provided; however, we are updating the expected impact from currency. We expect organic revenue growth of 4% to 5% and comparable currency neutral EPS growth of 4% to 6%, inclusive of a three to four point structural headwind to income before tax. Moving to currencies, while current spot rates have improved since our fourth quarter call, these rates have been extremely volatile as well. Therefore, I will caveat our currency outlook, knowing that it is definitely subject to change. We will update you accordingly as we move through the year. Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we now expect the full year impact of currency to be a two to three point headwind on net revenue versus our previous expectation of four points. Relative to income before tax, we now expect an eight to nine point headwind as compared to our previous expectation of a nine point headwind. As you model the second quarter, there are a couple of items to consider. We expect the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items to be a two to three point headwind on net revenue and a three point headwind on income before tax. Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we expect that currency will be a two to three point headwind on net revenue and a six point headwind on operating income. In addition, we will be cycling the euro debt remeasurement gain we recorded in other income during the second quarter of 2015. For this reason, we expect an 11 point currency headwind on income before tax as we cycle this gain. In closing, we are working diligently to deliver our commitments for 2016. We continue to focus on our core capabilities of building brands, driving customer value and leading the system so that when we complete our refranchising, we will be a lower risk, higher return business with even greater confidence to achieve our long-term growth targets. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from John Faucher of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nJohn A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Morning.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Morning.\nJohn A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Morning. So as I look at your revenue performance this quarter, I guess it highlights a concern that maybe the portfolio is still a little too CSD heavy, despite some of the great results on the non-carb side. And James talked about this at CAGNY, 5% NARTD dollar growth longer-term, but given the fact that you guys still under-index on the non-carb side, that's providing really the majority of the growth in both dollars and volume for the category, don't you need to, I guess, further accelerate the shift in the portfolio away from CSDs, sparkling, into non-carb, and is there a way to move that faster? And I guess on top of that, obviously the weakness in the CSD side this quarter with flat volumes, what do you think is really the right volume number on the CSD side going forward that gets you to your algorithm? Thank you.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, John. It's Muhtar here. I'll just preface just by saying the following and then pass over to James, but first, you know how much we've done and how much we focus on creating successful brands in our still portfolio. And of the 20 $1 billion brands we have now, 14 of them are still brands. And our still business is performing well. And whether we take value-added dairy or enhanced hydration, or juices and nectars, or juice drinks, we play in all of those categories. In 2015, we gained share in all of those categories. And if you look at whether it's in developed markets or emerging or developing, our still beverage portfolio is being enhanced all the time and even in the case of waters and premium waters from Japan all the way through to Latin America, performing very well. You just heard now again that we've invested. We just recently invested, as you know, in Suja in the United States. We've invested in Chi and Culiangwang in China. And we continue to always reference that, wherever we look and if there's opportunities for bolt-on acquisitions, we will look at those favorably. If there are also opportunities for organic development of brands, like fairlife, we will certainly look at those also favorably, as we've done. So I think we're very satisfied with our portfolio. And certainly, we've got more work to do, as we said in the call and in the remarks. But right now, we feel that our portfolio is being transformed very well, and transitioned very well. And we're in a pretty good place, and more work to continue. James?\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, just let me add one last thought perhaps, John. At CAGNY, we talked about, we have a 50% share of sparkling and a 15% share of the stills, but I think it's worth remembering that, over the last 15 years, we've gone from stills being less, a single digit part of our portfolio, to now over 25% of our portfolio. So I think there's a long-term track record of generating growth and value in stills. Even given today our market position, we expect to continue to grow faster in stills. As we said in the call, we are gaining share in every subcategory, apart from one where we held it, and we'll continue to look for bolt-on acquisitions to accelerate our growth. So I think it's going to continue to be a faster growing part of the business.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And also, just on sparkling, you asked, we certainly see also continued growth opportunities in our sparkling portfolio. And that is naturally, with the focus on revenues, it will skew more towards revenues, but certainly also, as we have demonstrated and with our new campaign, Taste the Feeling campaign, just being launched, and everything else that we're doing in terms of the investments with our aligned partners, we see growth opportunities in revenue and also in volume, in our sparkling beverage portfolio.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Powers of UBS. Your line is now open.\nStephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thanks. Good morning.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Morning.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Morning.\nStephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Maybe sticking with the top line, I just want to better understand where you expect to source top-line acceleration from over the remainder of the year, against a difficult macro environment and increasingly difficult year-over-year compares? I get that you were probably closer to 4% organic growth this quarter, excluding the calendar shift and the price/mix drag of BIG, but BIG will be with you over the balance of the year. So in that context, is there truly enough in your control to have confidence in sequential improvement, or are you expecting the macros to improve? And I guess, alongside all that, is it fair to say that you're guiding us more towards the lower end of 4% to 5% at this point, versus the midpoint?\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Steve. It's Muhtar. Well, first, I think we did expect the first quarter to trend slightly below the full year, driven by a couple of things. One, the macros are trending toward the bottom in the first quarter, recognizing that the environment continues to be challenging. But we will continue to monitor that closely. The launch of our new campaign in the first quarter will certainly benefit the back half of the year. The benefit of Olympics marketing as we move into the second and third quarter; one less selling day, which certainly you also mentioned; and I think we are confident, definitely, in the strategy and initiatives in place to support our growth targets over the course of the year, and believe that we will land again in the corridor that we stated in the past, in February. James or Kathy, you want to add anything?\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: No.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel. Your line is now open.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Question on North America, we now have the filings you've given us and we can, therefore, see the level of profitability here in CCR, which is pretty low. I think, when you back out the numbers, you get kind of like a 2% operating margin. And I'm sure there's some accounting matters in there that this isn't the forum to go into, but it does raise the question of what really has been going on in terms of profitability for CCR here in North America. If you think it's appropriate, I think it would be helpful to talk a little bit about the trends in that business as you've seen them, now that we're seeing a level \u2013 the margin I'm getting is a 2% operating margin. So can you just talk a little bit about the trends and what you think they reflect? It certainly speaks well to what you get left behind, if you will, but it raises questions about what someone might pay for that kind of business.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So sure, Mark. We look at the margins and CCR, there are three primary drivers of what you're seeing. First of all, we have shifted some of the territories, so we have transitioned some territories to-date. And we did that, obviously, before we put the financials out there earlier this quarter. Then if you remember, we incurred, back in early 2010, 2011, 2012 time period, there was a significant hit to us from a run-up in commodity prices that certainly adversely impacted margins. And then I guess the third thing I'd say was we had to incur incremental costs to prepare that business for now being ready to be refranchised and to strengthen that business. And I think what we are seeing is improvement in the results that I would say today. But those three things really are impacting what you saw in the financials that we put out there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to go back and tie, I guess, a couple of comments that have been made about the effect that BIG had on organic sales growth for the quarter. So I just want to make sure I understand it correctly. If we look at sales excluding BIG and we add back the effect of the extra day, organic sales growth was around 4%. Is that correct?\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: It's James here. Look, volume grew 2%. Core price/mix was 2%. So that's the right answer.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJudy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning. So I guess one of the markets where you pointed out you were taking more actions is Europe, and certainly, from a top line perspective, continues to be a pretty challenged market, deflationary pressure there. So wanted to just get a little bit more color, just really what are some of the more tangible actions that we can see? And how much dollars are really going in in terms of the marketing investments that we should expect to see some of that improvement really coming through and how long that would sort of take as you think about for the balance of the year?\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, Judy. It's James here. A couple of things on Europe, one, it is worth noting that in this quarter, there was a disruption to the business in GB due to the supply chain. So there's a one-off impact that we expect to see not recurring in the balance of the year. So I think that's worth taking into account. And it was a material impact. Now, as looking for the rest of the year, you will see in the numbers we had pretty decent price/mix in Europe in this quarter. And we are also looking to see volume improving versus the first (34:40) quarter, not just because of the supply situation, but also the new programs, the launch of the new marketing campaign, the launch of a new Coke Zero variant starting in GB, plus the Europe Cup, which will be in France this year. And, of course, shortly, we will hopefully complete Coca-Cola European Partners, where there are very strong plans being put in place to drive that forward. So I think some temporary factors and the buildup of our ongoing investments should drive a better result in Europe in the balance of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to delve a bit more into the Asia Pacific pricing number in the quarter, a negative 5%. Can you run through how much of that was due to geographic or product mix or other factors and thoughts going forward in the remainder of the year on if that pricing pressure will moderate and how mix should trend in that segment?\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Sure, James here. I'll come to the numerical piece. Let me start off with the conceptual. (35:54) The Asia Pacific price/mix is always a little bit of an oddity, because it's a group that brings together Japan and Australia, which are very high revenue markets that don't grow as quickly, along with a lot of emerging markets, not just China but India, Indonesia and the Philippines, which grow much faster. So there's a kind of an ongoing mechanical effect that creates a negative price/mix for this group, which you can see over the years in Asia Pacific. So in 2013, full year, it was minus 4%. In 2014, it was minus 2%. In 2015, it was minus 2%. In the first quarter of 2016, obviously, it was minus 5%, but it was cycling a very atypical plus 3% in the first quarter of last year. So I think what you will see is in the future quarters, it is a little volatile and bumpy, but the long-term trend is for a negative price/mix in Asia because of the dynamic of the fast growth of the emerging markets versus Japan and Australia.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj of Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. So I'm still getting a lot of skepticism from investors about the 4% to 5% organic revenue growth target for the year. And openly, you don't sound 100% confident and it feels like there's a lot of kind of messiness and moving parts. So can you try again? Can you talk about what specifically you're seeing right now that gives you confidence in the 4% to 5% organic sales growth for the year? I mean, clearly, whether it's a 3% or a 4%, you kind of delivered a 3% in some sense this quarter, so you're below pace, so maybe in that you can tackle where you expect Eurasia Africa to get to, why you'd expect it to get better. Europe, you mentioned you're going to invest more and you hope that to get better, but we've sometimes heard that before. So why is it going be better in Europe? And then, maybe as a jumping off point as well, you can talk about what you're learning in North America, because that seems to be doing better, for sure. And a footnote, I'm not quite sure what you grow organically North America because you want us to add three points back for concentrate sales up to unit case sales for one day missing. I'm not quite sure how to get there, so some explanation there would be great. But just more specifics very clearly on what gives you the confidence in your top-line target for the year. Thanks.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Ali, I'll start just by saying, as I indicated, first, on the core, with one less selling day and on the core price/mix of the core business without BIG, we certainly did get to the 4% in this quarter. So what we feel looking at the downhill comparisons and looking at also all the programs in place, looking at how our business performs in all the different quarters and different groups, we feel confident that we still will achieve what we have said in February in terms of the top line for the full year. The marketing program, the additional marketing, the new marketing program, that is just being launched and then not having the one less selling day and then also the continued franchising and all the programs that the bottlers have in place. So our U.S. business is performing very well with its revenue growth, with its price/mix, with its brand, with its portfolio and that will continue. We have every confidence that it will continue. And we do believe that macros are at the bottom and that there will be in the second half a certain degree of improvement in the macros. Or even if they stay the same, we feel confident with the current macro situation that we will get to the corridor that we have indicated and shared with you in February. Any other comments, James, Kathy?\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: No, I think the one thing I would add, Ali, is obviously there's a strong momentum in the North America business. We called that out as the place where the strategies are working. And then the other countries I put in the other two buckets, there's degrees of implementation of the strategy. So you can go to around the world, there were places which were struggling in 2014 and maybe even in 2015, and as we've been executing the strategy, the momentum is starting to come back to some of those countries and it's starting to build over time. So I think, as Muhtar said, the first quarter was kind of within the envelope of expectation for our guidance. And we can see, based on what we're doing within our control, within a reasonable scenario of macros, we will stay within that corridor for the rest of the year, but in the end, I guess, only results will answer the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Cooper of Consumer Edge Research. Your line is now open.\nBrett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC: Thanks. The refranchising that you announced today includes a creation of a new bottler from outside the industry. You've spoken a lot about the collective willingness of your existing bottlers to invest and a desire for more territories. So can you help us understand why you went outside of the existing system for this refranchising? And is there something you're seeing from other new bottlers that makes this more appealing to you guys?\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I think on that, predominantly, we have existing bottlers that are expanding, if you look at the percentages of territories that have been franchised. And then we have, in order to ensure that we can get the right level of diversity in our bottling business and the right level of also representation, we have also selected some new partners like in Florida, like in Chicago and like now the most recent one announced. And we feel that that is a healthy mix and that that's also a healthy balance. And we have, very much, the right approach and the right alignment with our expanding bottling partners, whether they are just entering our system or they are proven expanding bottlers, like the ones that we've mostly franchised new distribution to in the past year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nWilliam G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Morning.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Morning, Bill.\nWilliam G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Can you guys give us a little bit more granular bridge on the gross margin decline this quarter and then maybe some broad stroke outlook for the rest of the year? I know the comps sort of get easier as the year progresses, but it'd be really helpful to just aggregate the FX impacts, some of the refranchise impacts and then kind of what you're thinking for the rest of the year.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Kathy?\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Certainly, Bill. So really, the gross margin decline is really impacted by just two things really. It's currency and it's the structural impact. Currency, I think added like 80 basis points \u2013 would have added 80 basis points back to our gross margin and the structural impact actually would have added significantly more than that. So it's really as simple as that. It's really about currency and our structural adjustments.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line's now open.\nKevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Good morning. So question, how much slip-down in the top line in the quarter was macro slowing in the NARTD category versus execution? You spoke to share gains in both stills and sparklings, so it would certainly seem to be just broader slowing in the category. And then, of course, there's been a lot of discussion on the top line. It would seem like the lower end of your 4% to 5% organic sales outlook would be prudent at this point. So a follow-up question on that, how much visibility do you have on productivity and other levers to deliver the high end of the EPS growth guidance range, should you come in toward the lower end on the top line? Thank you.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Let me take a bite of that, Kevin. I think the answer on the slowdown, we don't get all the category numbers necessarily. And but clearly, as we're gaining share in that top-line number, there's got to be some weakness in the category versus the long-term target of 5%. I think we talked a little bit about that at CAGNY about how our expectations for 2016 and 2017 were below the long-term 5% dollar value for NARTD. So there's definitely some of that. And I think you can see the macros influencing the industry in the sense that it's the number of the emerging markets, particularly the commodity ones, where we've had the slowdown, and that's clearly flowing through into the industry. I think what I would highlight is, we're going to focus on what we can control. We have a long-standing game plan of what to do in countries that are in crisis, focusing on really gaining a lot of share, to set ourselves up profitably for the long term. It's worked in a lot of countries in the past, and it seems to be working now as we gain share in the Chinas and the Russias and the Brazils. It'll pay off in the end. I think the visibility, look, we're managing to our corridors at the top and the bottom line. We feel that this quarter was within the envelope. Clearly the macros, slightly better, slightly worse, will be an influence on where we end up. But we've got a lot of management left to do in the balance of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Your line is now open.\nWilliam B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Morning.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Morning, Bill.\nWilliam B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Could you just talk a little bit more about, now that you've unveiled kind of the one brand packaging in, I guess it's being launched in Mexico, expectations for that, and maybe what you've learned as you've tested it out? And I say that just \u2013 I understand it's certainly going to be more efficient from an advertising, marketing front to kind of, on the one brand strategy, but didn't know if you expected a sales lift, or if there's been any confusion from consumers as they've seen it, just kind of thoughts as we start to launch that?\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Bill, this is Muhtar. We said from the beginning, first, that the new campaign is not just a new campaign, but also, it's a new strategy, in terms of the one brand strategy, and that it's got many advantages. And we expect it to give us significant efficiencies and effectiveness. But also, in terms of how we communicate with our consumers, it will certainly play into that as we execute the strategy. And we've now launched the new campaign. And then I'll let James comment in terms of, you asked the Mexico-specific example, but also, there's also many other places where it's being tested, and tested favorably. Go ahead, James.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, Bill, a few thoughts. One, the initial pilot markets, the two sources of very clear impact were, one, it helped us expand and grow the zero calorie variant of Coca-Cola by driving availability and driving trial. So we would expect to see benefits on the zero sugar variants. The second big area of benefit is, it helps us create what we would call corporate blocking. In other words, we execute in stores all the variants of Coca-Cola together as one big block, has a much greater store impact, visual impact, engagement with people who are shopping the stores. I think slightly more strategically, and back to Muhtar's point, this is an implementation of a strategic idea. I'm sure we'll evolve it. I'm sure we'll make it better, but it's the strategic idea that's important. It's not just about the efficiency in the advertising. It's about helping consumers join and stay in the Coca-Cola franchise, whatever of the ingredients they want to manage, including their management of added sugars, whether that's in drinks or any other categories that have added sugar in. So this has a number of benefits that are going to play out strategically, and we will keep improving the execution.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nAmit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Morning.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Morning, Amit.\nAmit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): James, I just wanted to, as we look to the rest of the year and 2017 as well, can you also talk about the progress of the small pack architecture? Like, we've heard a lot about that in North America, but if you can give us a little bit more detail as, where are we with that in rest of your divisions? And is that a source of incremental growth or price/mix as we go forward?\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yes. A few thoughts then. Clearly, North America has had a lot of traction in pushing forward smaller packages, away from the traditional two-liter and multi-pack of cans. It is worth noting that some of those packages are premium packages, and some of those are intended to create affordability or low price point entry points for the category, whether it be the mini cans. And that combination does generally help price/mix. You can see that starting to roll out across other parts of the world. I think Latin America's traditionally been very good at that. You do see more of it coming in to Asia Pacific and Eurasia on a global basis. The immediate consumption packages outpaced general volume growth. So it is part of our strategy to push more into smaller packages. Just this last month, India launched a new technology, a very small package with a special technology that allows a much longer shelf life in ambient environment of rural India, so it will be able to get to many more places. So, a lot of innovation in the technology, a lot of innovation in the package, in the sizes and the occasions and the channels, so that we can bring down the price points for affordability, take advantage of premiumization, and also offer people the right amount of any beverage that they want to actually consume.\nAmit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: One point I'd just add, Amit, would be that the U.S. compared to the rest of the world, the prevalence of small packages was much less in the United States three, four years ago compared to the rest of the world. If you look at Europe and places like Spain, or if you look at many countries in Latin America, you had much more prevalence of smaller packages than in the United States. So in a way, the United States in the last four, five years, but particularly the last two and a half years has moved very rapidly to the 12-ounce glass to the 8-ounce glass to the 7.5-ounce can to the 8.5-ounce aluminum bottle. And that has really worked and those are all growing double digits in the United States because the consumer and customer preferences, and also benefiting our system because they have a higher price per liter. And so that's in a way playing out from what was already prevailing in many parts of the world in the past.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.\nVivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Morning.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Morning.\nVivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: I was hoping we could talk a little bit more about the health of brand Coca-Cola. In your press release, you called out softness either around the total brand family or Trademark Coca-Cola in a number of geographies. And while I appreciate that you have a lot of new initiatives, between Taste the Feeling and new packaging. In the past, you guys have said that it does take time for some of those advertising initiatives to actually gain traction and show up in brand health and volume. So how should we think about the trajectory of Trademark Coca-Cola as you roll out these new initiatives, please? Thank you.\nJames Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, Vivien, I think a couple of things. One, obviously most of our campaigns are weighted into the second, third and fourth quarters. So those are the biggest quarters. And even Taste the Feeling, we announced it this quarter, but it's only really hitting at towards the end of the quarter and rolling out in the rest of the year, as with the Euro Cup and the Olympics. So I think a lot of the programs are going in later this year. They, obviously, the execution is there. So we would expect to see better performance from Trademark Coca-Cola going into the downhill. I would make one other note, which is the relative change in where global growth is coming from, or industry growth is coming from, a little more in developed and developing, a little less in emerging, tends to create a kind of a portfolio effect that weighs a little more against sparkling and, therefore, Coca-Cola, because those emerging markets tend to be more sparkling orientated. And so you see North America, Latin America, Japan, with stronger stills growth. So we do expect to see growth. We would expect to see it coming back. There is a geographic mix impact, but when we look at the markets, we believe we will be back on track with Coca-Cola.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nRobert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI: Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to follow up on the questions on the one brand strategy and specifically ask when you look at, let's say, the full implementation of that two, three years from now, do you think the benefit will be 50%-50% between cost savings and efficiency and greater demand or how do you see that breaking out? And specifically also in terms of the answer to the prior question on that, how exactly is this strategy helping drive trial and availability for Coke Zero? Thank you.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Robert, it's Muhtar here. I think, first, in terms of the efficiencies, the most important benefit will be simpler and less fragmented communication with the consumer. That will be the biggest benefit, but also it will certainly help create more efficiencies and effectiveness in our non-working EME (55:32) and, therefore, will also provide some productivity in that respect. But the most important benefit will certainly be a less cluttered and better and more direct communication with the consumer base. And in terms of the trial of product, that will certainly come as a result of that, of what James mentioned in terms of better presence in the store, in terms of better merchandising, in terms of better interruptions in the store and also in terms of the communication piece. And we believe that the most important benefit of this will ensue and will come to brands like Coca-Cola Zero with more availability, better communication and have the broad perspective of the global campaign as opposed to the every different brand under the Coca-Cola trademark having their own campaigns. That will be how I think the benefits will come. And we trialed and pilots so far have proven that in Europe and other parts of the world.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Muhtar Kent for closing remarks.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, James, Kathy and Tim. We're in the midst of transforming The Coca-Cola Company to one that's even more focused on our core value creation model of building strong brands, enhancing customer value and leading our franchise system. At the same time, we continue to evolve and strengthen our global bottling system as we accelerate refranchising and as we return to a predominantly concentrate-driven model with significantly higher margins and returns. We remain confident that the long-term dynamics of our industry are promising. And we absolutely believe that The Coca-Cola Company is well-positioned to deliver long-term value to our shareowners.

Now let me turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In 2017, we completed another solid quarter of operating performance, capping off a successful year. The nonalcoholic beverage industry was a little soft during 2017, as the emerging and developing markets slowed slightly from prior year, but the developed world continued its growth strategy. We continued to gain global value share for both the quarter and the year. And importantly, we achieved or exceeded the guidance we shared with you at the beginning of 2017. Full year organic revenue grew 3%, with four out of five category clusters delivering top-line growth, led by our sparkling soft drink portfolio. Underlying PBT grew 9% versus our goal of 7% to 8%, as we accelerated the capture of certain productivity savings. And we delivered comparable EPS of $1.91, which was ahead of our plan. While we did what we said we'd do, it's still not as much as we aspired to. We need to be growing revenue and EPS at a faster rate. Now looking around the world. All of our operating segments delivered positive organic revenue growth. We saw solid growth in our developed markets, particularly in Europe and North America, driven by improving execution in recently refranchised territories and enhanced pricing and packaging strategies. Our China business built momentum in 2017 even as we refranchised our bottling system. Other emerging markets were more challenging, especially in the first half of the year, but we saw improvement in key markets like India, Argentina and Brazil as we moved into the second half. We accomplished this growth while driving significant change at our company as we accelerated our transformation into a total beverage company with a broad, consumer-centric brand portfolio and an asset-light business model. First, we implemented a new operating model designed to enable an accountable, performance-driven growth culture that we believe will result in greater returns for our shareholders; a lean model with employees who are externally focused, empowered, quick to take action and willing to take smart risks. To accomplish this, we made significant changes to our leadership team, corporate structure and updated both our incentive metrics and compensation philosophy. Second, we implemented new digital platforms to support our leaner operating environment and improve the employee experience. This lays the groundwork for initiatives like the SAP implementation that will take place this year. Third, we expanded our consumer-centric product portfolio, scaling wins from market-to-market, leveraging M&A and embracing more of an experimental test-and-learn approach to marketing new products. For example, we entered the fast-growing U.S. ready-to-drink coffee category, capturing over 7 points of value share by the end of the year. We lifted and shifted two of our leading U.S. brands, Honest and smartwater, into multiple international markets and acquired AdeS, the leading plant-based beverage brand in Latin America with the intension of expanding it into Europe in the near future. More importantly, we launched Coca-Cola Zero Sugar in 20 markets, with a clear four-point playbook of a great-tasting reformulated product, evolved marketing, new packaging and upgraded execution. And we saw very positive results with the brand growing revenue double digits, including a meaningful acceleration in Coca-Cola Zero Sugar strength in the U.S. since its launch in Q3. Of course, it's not just about large brands. We balance rolling out large-scale brands and keeping an entrepreneurial focus on emerging consumer trend and identifying products that meet those trends. This is about developing brands, channels and points of engagements with our consumers. For example, we adjusted our pack price offering to adapt to the explosion of online ordering in China. And we're leveraging a decade of learnings from North America's Venturing & Emerging Brands model to approach opportunities in international markets. As I mentioned last quarter, we launched a unit in Central and Eastern Europe to test premium brands in high-value outlets and channels through a separate route-to-market. And of course, while it's still early days, the unit has met our expectations, and we are moving quickly to expand coverage to another seven cities in Europe. Fourth, we focused on converting portfolio expansion into stronger revenue growth. This can clearly be seen in our EMEA operating segment, where organic revenue growth accelerated from a 3% run rate over the past few years to a strong 5% in 2017. We accomplished this in part due to the revenue growth management initiatives that focuses on small baskets and pack sizes. These initiatives were phased into several EMEA markets over the year, and we will continue to roll them out in additional markets in 2018 and so expect to see continued momentum this year. And finally, we reenergized our system for future growth. Over the last few years, as you well know, we have been returning ownership of our company-owned bottling operations to independent companies around the world. In 2017, we accomplished major milestones in three of our most important markets. We sold our bottling businesses in China, creating two strong bottlers with contiguous territories. Our two largest bottlers in Japan merged creating a single bottler, covering roughly 85% of our system in that important profit pool. And most importantly, we completed refranchising of our U.S. bottling operations. At the same time, our North America business continued to deliver top-tier FMCG performance with 3% organic revenue growth. Ultimately, all of these strategic and tactical changes mean something very important. We are assertively shifting our culture, the way we operate, the way we look at growth opportunities and the way we engage with our bottling system. It's been a lot of change, and much of it is only just starting to show tangible results, which is a good thing when you think about future performance. Looking ahead, 2018 is shaping up to be stronger than 2017. We are well positioned to accelerate our top-line performance based on the actions we've taken, the impact of new U.S. tax legislation on consumer spending and the improvement in the global economy. And while the economic environment in key emerging markets like Brazil and Argentina may not yet have tipped into a tailwind scenario, they are also not causing the same level of headwinds they did last year for our industry. With that as a backdrop, we feel confident that the revenue growth initiatives we've launched in multiple markets, coupled with the strong rollout of brands like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, FUZE Tea, AdeS plant-based beverages and smartwater will enable us to deliver 4% organic revenue growth. We will balance productivity with reinvestment to deliver significant underlying operating new (10:48) margin expansion for the year. And our refranchising effort's largely complete and a benign currency environment, we expect to grow comparable EPS 8% to 10%. Now, of course, many of you have asked us how U.S. tax reform will impact our business. Overall, we view this as encouraging for the operating environment. Clearly, tax reform will make investing in the U.S. more attractive and should spur economic growth. We are currently evaluating it and expect our system to accelerate investments to capture further opportunities. The tax reform also eliminates a long-standing distortion due to the former U.S. worldwide tax system, which will make it easier for our company to manage its cash and debt balances. However, in the short term, there are puts and takes to the financial benefit. Over the next eight years, the lower effective tax rate will mostly be offset by the annual payment on the tax charge we took during the fourth quarter. Now, while we are focused on delivering this year's plan, we must also keep an eye on the long-term health of our business. In order to have a healthy business, you need to operate in a healthy community. One of today's biggest problems is packaging waste. And over the decades, Coca-Cola has done a lot of work on recycling. We made most of our packaging fully recyclable, and we've invested a lot in R&D around reusing plastic. And now we're doing more. Our system is fundamentally reshaping our approach to packaging, with a goal to collect and recycle the equivalent of 100% of all the bottles and cans we sell by 2030. We're also increasing the amount of recycled content in our packaging, and we're working to make all of our packaging finally 100% recyclable. In a world where packaging waste, especially plastic waste, is a growing problem, we are working to make sure that no bottle is ever a single-use bottle. Through recycling, it'll have more than one life. This is the next step in our ongoing sustainability efforts, building off our success in replenishing 100% of the water we use in making our beverages. We must grow with conscience and, therefore, becoming a total beverage company that grows the right way because it is the correct thing to do for the consumers and our business. So finally, to recap, we had a successful year. We implemented a culture shift, which is ongoing. We made large scale changes to strengthen our bottling system, met or exceeded our financial guidance and delivered top-tier FMCG organic revenue growth. And we are encouraged that 2018 will be even stronger. With that, I'm going to hand over to Kathy.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As James said, 2017 was a good year as we met or exceeded our financial guidance during significant change at the company. Our press release covers our fourth quarter results in detail, so I will focus on the implications from the U.S. tax reform, two accounting changes that will affect our operating margins and our 2018 guidance. Starting with the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, while I won't touch on every element, I think there are three important factors to review: the impact to our underlying effective tax rate; the tax liability on our foreign accumulated earnings; and capital structure implications. First, based on our expected earnings split between U.S. and international locations, we estimate this will lower our global effective tax rate to approximately 21% in 2018 compared to our 24% rate in 2017 and our previously expected 2018 tax rate of 26%. However, we expect increased variability from quarter-to-quarter, as future interpretations of the law and updates to the related accounting guidance could have an impact on our effective tax rate for 2018 and beyond. Therefore, the 21% effective tax rate estimate is just that, an estimate, and will be subject to change. As we go through the year, we will update you on any potential changes. Second, in the fourth quarter, we recorded a one-time non-cash charge of $3.6 billion associated with the enactment. The charge encompasses several elements, including a one-time $4.6 billion tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a primarily offsetting net deferred tax benefit of $1 billion. Despite being recorded in the fourth quarter, the one-time tax will be paid over an eight-year period, as stipulated by the Act. So the cash flow impact from the $4.6 billion charge will fall in future periods, but will be more than offset by the accumulated cash benefit from the lower ongoing tax rate after a six- to seven-year payback period. While the accumulated impact is a benefit to free cash flow, the tax payments impact the company's free cash flow conversion target over the next eight years. At our Investor Day last November, we introduced a free cash flow conversion target of 95% to 100% of GAAP net income, adjusted to exclude non-cash items impacting comparability. While the lower effective tax rate will benefit both earnings and cash flow by the same amount, the tax on historical foreign earnings will only impact our free cash flow. So this has the mathematical effect of lowering our free cash flow conversion. Since the impact of tax reform was not anticipated when we provided the guidance during our Investor Day, we are now adjusting our target to 90% to 95% during this eight-year period of tax payments. Turning to implications on our capital structure and cash repatriation, now that the U.S. has moved to a modified territorial regime, it will make it easier to manage our cash and debt. As a result, we are providing a few updates to our capital structure. First, we have a target of 2 to 2.5 times net debt leverage, as we believe this provides the right balance between reaching the optimal capital structure and preserving financial flexibility as we move forward on strategic initiatives. We currently operate at 3.9 times gross debt leverage and 2.2 times net debt leverage, with a credit rating of AA- from S&P and a Aa3 from Moody's. Since we are already operating within our target net leverage range, we intend to use approximately $7 billion of our cash held overseas to repay gross debt. This will allow us to reduce the spread between our gross and net debt levels, support our credit rating and continue to access the commercial paper market and reduce our net interest expense. The remaining cash will continue to be invested overseas, as a significant portion of it is non-remittable because of local regulations or is required for working capital purposes. Another portion is required to support our commercial paper program, and then some of the cash is earning a good return in certain overseas markets. And finally, our cash priorities remain the same. We will continue to reinvest in the business, grow the dividend, fund acquisitions and use any remaining cash for net share repurchases. As we move forward, we will periodically reevaluate and balance our opportunities with our cash flow needs. At times, and as appropriate, if we have excess cash, we could use that cash to buy back shares above our previously stated goal of offsetting any equity dilution. Moving on to changes in accounting standards. The FASB, which is the Financial Accounting Standards Board, issued an accounting standards update on revenue from customer contracts. Based on classifications provided by this new guidance, we will now be required to account for a small number of contracts differently in the future. While there are various considerations, the primary impact will be that certain revenue and costs and contracts that were previously netted together in revenue will now be grossed up into the revenue and cost of goods sold component going forward. Further, as this change is prospective, meaning there is no restatement of prior results, this will result in an estimated increase in net revenue growth of 1% to 2% and an increase of 3% to 5% in cost of goods sold in 2018. Importantly, there is no material impact to our consolidated profit or EPS as a result. However, the math of this accounting change does result in operating margin compression. This change impacts the operating segments in different ways, and it causes a timing difference, which impacts the quarters. Supplementary materials with additionally details on the impact to our operating segments and our quarters are filed on our website, and our Investor Relations team can cover any additional questions with you. The FASB also issued an accounting standards update on pensions and postretirement benefit costs, which requires companies to split out net pension expense, keeping the service costs and SG&A and moving the other components of pension expense to other income. As this is simply a re-class on the P&L, there is no impact to profit before tax or EPS. However, there is an impact to operating margins. Taking these two accounting changes together, we expect approximately 150 basis points of operating margin compression going forward. Turning to full year 2018 expected performance. We expect organic revenue growth to accelerate to 4%. We expect comparable EPS to grow 8% to 10%, with the majority of earnings growth coming from the second half of the year. And we expect cash from operations of at least $8.5 billion. This represents over a 20% rebound as we cycle certain cash costs associated with refranchising activities and with the restructuring of the organization in 2017. We will continue to follow our capital allocation priorities, starting with an expected $1.9 billion in capital investment. This is higher than our long-term expected spend due to investments we are making in 2018 to enhance digital capabilities. And we will return our free cash flow to share owners through dividends of approximately $6.7 billion and approximately $1 billion in net share repurchases. As announced yesterday, our board increased the dividend for the 56th year in a row to an annual equivalent of $1.56 per share, up 5% from $1.48. Now let me touch on key considerations and assumptions embedded in our outlook. We expect continued portfolio lift and shift initiatives such as Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and FUZE Tea, strong marketplace execution like we see in EMEA and a slightly improving macro outlook to result in stronger top-line growth. Along with some improvement in emerging markets, we see commodity prices rising. However, continued solid pricing and a focus on expense management will more than offset higher raw material costs. As such, we expect to deliver 8% to 9% underlying operating income growth. As mentioned previously, the accounting change for customer contracts will result in a 1 to 2 point tailwind to net revenue and a 3% to 5% increase to cost of goods sold, with a minimal effect on operating income. The pension accounting change will require restatement to our 2017 results, and given the amount of the reclass, we do not expect it to impact our 2018 guidance on operating income. Turning to structural items. We will continue to see a structural headwind in 2018, primarily due to the timing of when certain bottling operations were sold last year and the planned refranchising of bottling territories in Canada this year. Therefore, for 2018, we expect a 17% headwind to revenue and a 2% headwind to operating income from structural items. This will result, however, in an approximate 500 basis point benefit to comparable operating margins on top of solid underlying margin expansion in the core business. We expect currency to be a 0% to 1% headwind to operating income, as improving spot rates will be offset as we cycle hedging gains from 2017. Below the line, we expect modest deleverage. While we plan to repatriate approximately $7 billion of overseas cash to pay down debt, higher interest rates will result in an increase to net interest expense. These factors, along with our updated 21% effective tax rate, will lead to expected growth in comparable EPS of 8% to 10% in 2018. As we model the flow of the year, there are a few items to consider in terms of phasing for the year. We expect earnings growth to be back half weighted, primarily due to the timing of expenses and productivity initiatives. Moving specifically to the first quarter. The first quarter will have one less day than the prior year first quarter. We expect a 6 point headwind from structural items and a one point tailwind from currencies on operating income. And we expect the change in revenue recognition to be a 1 point tailwind to revenue and a neutral impact to operating income in the first quarter. Now I realize that was a lot to cover. And as always, our Investor Relations team will be happy to walk through each of these elements in more detail as you build out your models over the year. So in summary, we delivered against our guidance in 2017 during tremendous change in the organization and our broader system. We believe we are well positioned as we enter into 2018 and expect accelerated performance. And then, finally, abating headwinds from currency, macros and structural impacts, along with an improving tax outlook, will allow a significant acceleration in our comparable EPS versus the past several years. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin our formal question and answer portion of the call. Our first question is from Mr. Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nSteve Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nSteve Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Happy Friday.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yes.\nSteve Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So James and Kathy, you both touched upon this in your prepared remarks, and I'm sure you'll speak to it in more detail next week as well. But can you just, perhaps, expand a bit further on what makes you confident in the 4% organic growth guide for next year? It's clearly a solid number. It benchmarks really well against what we heard from peers and the momentum that you have coming out of the fourth quarter helps, I think, put it in perspective. But what are the relative tailwinds that your system may have that other companies may lack right now? Because I think there's probably a bit of skepticism, maybe some concern out there today that 4% growth may be just be too aspirational, just given what we've heard from others this season. So I guess the question is really why is 4% the right call for Coke when the rest of global CPG seems anchored to more like 2% or 3% growth right now? Thanks so much.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thanks. So a couple of thoughts that I think can underpin our expectations around the 4%. I mean, firstly, look back to 2017, clearly, we were making sequential improvement as we went through 2017, as we were finishing the refranchising, as we were building out the greater portfolio plans, we were, as you said, the fourth quarter was good and so was the third quarter in 2017. So I think the first point is, we were seeing some sequential improvement, so we were coming out of 2017 into 2018 with a better run rate. Secondly, we talked on the Investor Day that what we needed to do to get back into our revenue growth rate range for our long-term model, there were a number of things we need to do on the portfolio, on some of the clusters, on some of the revenue growth management strategies and also, to some extent, an improvement in the macro environment in the emerging and developing markets. So there were things that we had to do, and there was some of the environment that would get us well into our range of the 4% to 6%. So I think what you're seeing is a good \u2013 another good step forward in 2018, of us executing events what we need to execute, particularly the portfolio expansion and some of the RGM work. And you can see that some of that coming through in the fourth quarter. So I think the actions are in place. The results are starting to come. The momentum is building. We're not out of the woods in 2018. The world still remains uncertain and volatile. But I think the momentum's in the business and the momentum's in the actions that we laid out that needed to be taken, plus a little bit of an improvement in the emerging macros, makes us confident that 4% is a good number for 2018.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nLauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thanks. Good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nLauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Want to talk a little bit about EMEA. So really solid price/mix, obviously, so revenue growth management showing through would seem for both developed and developing markets. And yet, you had margins down pretty considerably. So could you just talk a little bit about what went on there that quarter? And how we should think about that looking forward? Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. Firstly, on EMEA, I mean, there's a couple of things. Clearly, we were executing against our plan to expand the portfolio, and I think they've got good growth and good launches, particularly coming into 2018, preparing the ground for the FUZE Tea launch and the AdeS plant-based drinks launch. So I think there's a lot going on, on the portfolio in EMEA, which is very encouraging. They have been executing a lot of revenue growth management approaches, some smart packaging, some different choices on pack sizes and driving transactions. I think you all have seen that come through in the results of both Coke Hellenic and Coca-Cola European Partners in the last few days. So there's a lot of good work going on in revenue growth management, and we \u2013 a bit back to the previous answer \u2013 we see that carrying through into 2018. We did have some places that weren't perfect. We had problems in Egypt and in South Africa, more to do with the macro environment in Egypt, the disruption of the supply chain. So my point of reference there is when we lose volume in some of the emerging markets, it kind of has a mechanical benefit on the price/mix. And I think the last thing I would say, so actually, really strong start in EMEA, also end to EMEA in 2017. And the other thing that's driving the margin is the Innocent business continues to perform really well in Europe. And given that that's finished-products business, it appears to create margin compression, but it also drives top-line and good results.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open.\nWilliam B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks, good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nWilliam B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Can you talk a little bit more about North America? I mean, since you have and continue to look like you will outperform your competitor and there's been, at least in the scanner data, more pricing promotional pressure. I mean, is that a risk, or are you seeing any real change in terms of more aggressive pricing to try to win back some share?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Look, I think, a couple of things. Firstly, we're very happy with our strategy in the U.S. We've been executing it for a good number of years. The team in North America, CCR as it was and now many parts that transferred to the bottlers, have been executing a great plan and winning in the marketplace and driving top-tier revenue growth. We've always said that it won't necessarily be a straight line in terms of pricing. However, I don't think the wheels have come off pricing in any shape or form. I think in part it's a question of comparisons. If you look at the two year run rates, you start to see much less noise than you do when you look at just versus prior year, and that includes ourselves where we're lapping a very strong price/mix from the fourth quarter of 2016. So I think, it appears to be more action than it actually is. We think that our focus on driving value for our customers, and ideally, helping beverages grow faster than their average business, is what's creating the environment where there's a lot of value creation for everyone, and I think that strategy continues. And I think it's being successful and we're continuing to drive it forward. And so I think while it's not going to be always a straight line, I think it's still good.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. Wanted to go back to the top-line organic sales growth, so the 4% that you mentioned for 2018; back in November 16 you said, 4% to 6% long term. I guess, do you wish you'd said 3% to 5% longer term? And if not, how do you build up to the 4% to 6% longer term in terms of price/mix, volume? And also even the 4% for 2018, how do you build up the price/mix and volume? And then a sub-question of that, hoping you'll take two questions, but a sub-question of that is you mentioned changes in compensation metrics. Can you talk about how that ties to that 4% to 6% or 4% for 2018 from a top-line growth perspective? Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Okay. Well, I do appreciate that you're all trying to talk me down from the revenue guidance. But let me lay it out. I mean, the 4% to 6%, couple of points. Firstly, we always said we were looking for a balance of price and volume. So in the long run, to get to our 4% to 6%, we know that that's going to be a mix of price and volume and in some degree of balance. Clearly, what we've not had enough of in the short term is volume. Although it's worth saying, as a consequence of our focus on smaller packages, transactions are growing a whole point faster than volume. So we see that the strategy is driving us to the right place, but over the long term, we would expect to see some degree of volume growth necessary to be comfortably in our range of 4% to 6%. And no, I don't regret not taking it down to 3% to 5%. And so that's what needs to happen. And it's not something that needs to happen tomorrow morning, but over time, yes, we'll need volume growth to balance out the pricing. And I think that's what we aim to do. Now, in terms of getting there, I would refer back to some of the material on the Investor Day, and we'll talk about it again at CAGNY on Tuesday. Clearly, what needs to happen to get comfortably into the 4% to 6%, and 2018 will be a step on that journey, which is why we're calling out 4%, which is the lower end of the range because we know, kind of, as I was saying on Steve's question, we know we need to do some more things on the portfolio. We're really driving expansion across the clusters. I mean, in the fourth quarter, our initiatives were about half coming out of sparkling and half coming out of the other categories. So we're starting to see more of the portfolio there, more of the way (35:26) to driving growth. And we know that we need to continue with our revenue strategies, particularly around smaller packages; reference my previous comment on transaction, but also improving macros. I mean, the emerging markets need to come back. I called it out in the script. The good news is Brazil's gone from being a major headwind. Actually, it was broadly flat in the fourth quarter. Over time, that market will come back and so will some of the other markets that have suffered. But it'll take time. And so I think it's the right journey. We know what we need to do. We know what macro environments need to improve. We can see a path in the long-term for the 4% to 6%, and we've got back into the range for 2018, and I think it's a solid estimate for 2018. Of course, the world could be volatile, uncertain, but I think it's a good estimate. I reference you back to 2017. We made a realistic assessment of what we thought would happen in 2017. We called it, and we basically hit it or slightly beat it in 2017, taking the actions we needed to take. And I think we got a strong plan in 2018, and it's robust.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nBonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you. Good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Bonnie.\nBonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I have a question on margins. Very impressive growth during the quarter, so wondering if you guys could drill down a little bit and quantify the different drivers of this, especially how much your refranchising contributed versus some of your other productivity efforts. And then separately, could you walk through how much of a contributor productivity will be to your structurally-adjusted operating income growth of 8% to 9% in 2018? Thanks.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure, Bonnie. Good morning. So if I were to, first of all, disaggregate the gross margin expansion, the majority of that increase is, in 2017, was from the structural change and from pricing. Gross margins are under some pressure from various finished goods businesses, and we also faced a slight headwind from currency and some incremental costs from the hurricanes from last year. Having said that, however, then pivoting over to our operating margins, in the fourth quarter, the margins expanded over 500 basis points. So we delivered very strong comparable margin expansion, and the primary driver of that again being the refranchising. And again offset by some of those costs and a donation that was made by corporate. So the majority of what you're seeing is driven by the refranchising, but at the operating margin level, a significant portion of that is being driven by the productivity initiatives, particularly the lean center initiatives. In 2018, the margin expansion will again be \u2013 gross margins will continue to be under pressure as we are moving to other categories. However, we will offset that with the productivity, particularly, lean enterprise initiatives, and there will, again, be more expansion due to the refranchising.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nNik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Good morning, everyone.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Hi, Nik.\nNik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: So the question I have is on costs, just kind of following up on the last question. How much of what you've identified is really just kind of corporate versus what's going on in the region? So I'm just trying to get an understanding of how much have you explored in all of the regions in terms of what you could possibly do in terms of a cost out perspective? Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah. Nik, hi. James here. We've been exploring what can be done in corporate and across the whole enterprise, including the field. We've been building this more as a culture than an event or a series of events. I think we made a lot of progress over the last number of years, going back to the start of several of these programs. So I think we have a clear line-of-sight to all the productivity initiatives we need to hit the targets we previously laid out. So there are no stones that are unturned. We not necessarily can address everything at the same time. Some things depend on systems being put in place, and you can't get everything done in the same day. Having said that, I'll repeat myself, we have clear line of sight to what we need to drive the productivity that's embedded in the margin expansion, because ultimately, we're driving productivity, but we're also reinvesting, we're also covering some inflation. So all of that is netted into the margin expansion that we're driving.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Laurent Grandet with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nLaurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, good morning, James and Kathy.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nLaurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I'd like to follow-up again on this, what seems to me, I mean, a weak profit guidance for this year. When we did the math, our initial reads suggest that the operating profit and EPS growth guidance is weaker than expected. So you said EPS would grow 8% to 10% from fiscal year 2017 based of $1.91, which, as we understand, it includes the benefit of the tax reform. So as tax will decline to 21%, that's roughly a seven-point benefit to EPS by your math?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: No.\nLaurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: No? So I mean, I'm just asking \u2013 I mean, did I miss something here, or I need some clarification on this because...\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah.\nLaurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah, go head.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: So our tax rate in 2017 was 24%. And we are estimating, and I underline Kathy's cautionary comments on it's not a fixed rate, so it could vary and particularly vary between quarters going down to 21%. So our year-to-year change in tax rate is 3 points, which, when you take it on the 76% of the cents on the dollar we were keeping, is a 4 percentage point headwind. So if you want to look at it that way, you can take 4 points off the EPS growth due to the tax changes. However, I would also point out that we have called out comparable EPS, so that includes the fact we're selling some of our bottling businesses, which is worth 2 points of growth. So you can net those two together. So actually, I think it's a pretty strong number off a 4% revenue growth in an environment where interest rates are increasing.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So on Latin America, one, just in terms of the price/mix improvement in the fourth quarter, it was quite strong, so just wanted to get a little bit more color there. And I know you touched on this, James, a little bit earlier about Brazil getting better, but wanted to just get a little bit more color just in terms of some of the initiatives that you had in place in the price pack architecture initiatives. How far along are you in that market? In contrast, Mexico softened a bit in the fourth quarter, so just trying to get a better sense of the outlook in that market within that region?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah. I shall go in reverse order. So I think Mexico did weakened \u2013 softened a little bit. I think it's largely the macro environment in Mexico is getting a little softer at the moment, and I think that'll likely play through a little bit, at least into the first half of 2018. But I think that's largely macro. Of course, we are adapting and looking to execute some initiatives around affordability, around packaging, around launching new products. We did de-prioritize in the fourth quarter a little bit of the low-margin bulk water, so that is part of the story but not the full story. So there a little bit of softness in Mexico. Now driving the price/mix in the fourth quarter clearly got better, and in part, it was due to the ongoing improvements in Brazil, where we had clarity been executing a plan through the year to improve affordability and focus on smaller packages that are more affordable but actually helped from a price/mix point of view. Plus we have the benefit of some of the price increases and incidence increases that flowed in in the back half of the year. So I think it was a pretty strong year of actions to drive RGM.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nRobert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI: Great. Thank you very much. You mentioned earlier on that transactions were growing 100 basis points faster than volume, which is terrific. I was wondering if you could just give us any more thoughts on that. Do you think that is the likely outlook going forward in terms of 100 basis points? Do you think that can expand? And how does that number compare on a geographic basis? Are there some areas where transactions are down or other areas where transactions are up much more than 100 basis points? Just more color around that would be helpful. Thank you.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yes, sure. So I think our objective and recent history is have transactions growing ahead of volume on an aggregate basis. So clearly, it's something that we are pursuing actively because we are pursuing a strategy of smaller packages across most of the geographies, whether it's through affordability or whether it's around helping people with portion control. There's a lot of places where we're trying to drive transactions ahead of volume. Now, the U.S. is one of those. Clearly, we've had the strategy around this area for some time. We made great progress. The mini cans were in double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, and the U.S. absolutely had transactions more than 100 basis points ahead of volume. So we were very pleased with the execution of that strategy in the U.S. Similarly, the other parts of the world that most of the countries' transactions are ahead of volume. Not everywhere, and that can sometimes be because we're trying to increase the affordability of the multi-serve packages, and that just happens to have a mechanical effect. But I would call out, as the kind of the lead ones in really driving smaller packages very assertively, are some of the developed markets led by places like the U.S., Australia, France, some of the places like that. And then in the emerging markets, it kind of depends on whether we're driving affordability or not.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Vivien Azer with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.\nVivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Hi. Good morning.\nVivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Was hoping you could speak to the repackage and flavor expansion of Diet Coke in the U.S. if you could just talk about your objectives there, what should we be expecting to see in Nielsen? What's the picture of success? Is this cutting the volume declines in half? Is it getting the brand back into growth? Anything you could offer would be helpful. Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. I mean, clearly, and it's one of our points of dissatisfaction in 2017 is we were not able to turnaround Diet Coke. I think the team have come up with a strong plan for 2018 with the new flavors, the new can design and size and some of the marketing. And I think we are going to have hopefully a better year in 2018 in terms of Diet Coke. I think we're finding a path forward. Clearly, part of the story in 2017 towards the end was we started doing even better with Coke Zero Sugar as the relaunch of that drove almost 10 points of growth in the fourth quarter on Coke Zero Sugar. Nevertheless, we want to improve Diet Coke, too. We had a strong start at the beginning of this year with the launch of new program. Clearly, we would love to at least stop declining, if not get into growth. I'm not sure just the flavors and the packages will get us there, but it's certainly going to be a good step in the right direction.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nAmit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning.\nAmit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): James, you mentioned in your script about the tax changes in the U.S. and its impact on U.S. consumption. Can you talk a little bit more about that? Where do you see most impact on consumption? How much, if you can quantify that? And then just tied to that, what's the expectation for the U.S. business in terms of 2018 top-line growth?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Well, I think the first thing to say is, the tax reform has just come in, and so we're not actually seeing the effects into the economy yet. Clearly, as the investments behind more opportunities, because of the lower tax rate, start to occur, that will lift aggregate demand. But in the end, we are a broad enterprise. And so, lifting of consumer income ultimately is what's going to flow through to us. As confidence returns in the economy, often you see increases in people going out and in foodservice, so you'd start to see it occur there. But we are ultimately going to benefit as the broad-based economy does better and more money flows into people's pockets. What was the second half of the question? Oh, North America. We don't provide a guidance number by group, but clearly, we've got a good strategy in North America. We believe that the sorts of revenue growth rates we've been delivering, like in 2017, put us in the top tier of FMCG. And we want to stay in the top tier of FMCG.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Pablo Zuanic with Susquehanna Financial Group. Your line is now open.\nPablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Thank you, and good morning, everyone.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nPablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: My question is on the fountain business. It's just a two-part question, very simple. It's a large part of your volume, about 35% in the U.S. Why has not been that refranchised, or will it be? I suppose that bottlers would benefit from that volume. And the second part to your question is, you've done a great job in terms of moving into smaller RTDs, garnering increasing revenue per case, higher growth there. I suppose that in some outlets, over time, you can ship from fountain to literally smaller PET bottles, and that could be very profitable for the whole system. So just can you give us a sense of how that can play out in the future? Thank you.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. I think you said the fountain was 75% of the volume. I'm not sure I heard you correctly. But just to clarify, the fountain business in the U.S. is about a third of the U.S. system volume, not 75% if that was the number you said. So it's about a third of the U.S. volume. It operates in a very different way to the bottle-can business. It requires different capabilities, both in the supply chain and the customer. And it operates largely with the national chains of customers, even more so and much more so than the grocery retail and the mom-and-pop business and the convenience store businesses or the kind of the brick-and-mortar store. So I don't think that there's any likelihood of us doing that in the short-term. I'm not sure I see the acceleration of performance advantage in doing so. And so I think we will stick to the strategy that we have. And then, in terms of fountain versus smaller PET, what we're focused on is making sure we're delivering the consumer experience that they are after in the outlet in which they're buying and optimizing that and providing that in the package form that best fits that consumer experience with the customer that they're at. So we're not trying to artificially drive the packaging structure one way or the other. We're trying to optimize the consumer experience.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ms. Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan Chase. Your line is now open.\nAndrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Hello. Yeah, so good morning and thanks for taking my question. I would like to just focus on FX outlook. I understand that now it's becoming a tailwind, finally. And how I understand that in the past was obviously a major drag to EPS. So how would you think for pricing and your ability to take more risks in innovation, let's say, in Latin America or even reinvest more in products that are less \u2013 like you quoted Honest Tea \u2013 on products that are less margin accretive in the beginning, but would be very growth accruing in the future? Thank you.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: I'll maybe take the first one. And if I've missed something, then you can jump in, Kathy.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Okay.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: I'm not sure that we link the two pieces of the question you're putting out. I mean, we largely have an approach where we drive our business in local terms. The world's not one-size-fits-all. So we look at each marketplace and say, what do we need to win in this marketplace with these consumers, working with the customers to create value for them. And the company is, in a way, the sum of all those local actions. Now a year ago, we talked about we were going to take some extra effort to make sure the sum of all that turns into positive comparable EPS growth in U.S. dollars, which it hadn't done necessarily for a few years. And we got to flat last year, and we're going to drive for some good growth in 2018. But the variations in FX, assuming they're not completely wild, don't drive our operational local market decisions. The expansion of the brands like Honest and all the other innovations are really driven by the market. And so, therefore, pricing is really driven by those local opportunities of launching the portfolio and local inflation. So to the extent that, I guess, FX somehow theoretically is linked to local inflation, it comes to play. But we start at the other end of the equation, which is what does the local market need in terms of products and pricing, and then work it back.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah, if I can just add. We talked about the tailwind in the first quarter, however, remember, we have a hedging strategy and that so whether it's a tailwind or a headwind, and we're really guiding towards more of a headwind, is because of our hedging strategy that we have employed. And so we're cycling some really good hedging gains from last year, which is causing most of that headwind for next year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question is from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning.\nBryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. I guess, question for you, Kathy. I just wanted to follow-up on some of the comments you made about free cash flow and the effect of the tax code change. We think about two things, gross debt and then, I guess, net interest expense, understand that the free cash flow conversion maybe comes down a bit, but seems like you had more access to cash. So I guess, over time, forgetting about what's going to happen this year, will you have the ability to maybe take gross debt balances down over the next few years is the first question? And then related to that as we think about interest expense, with rates rising and then whatever you may do with gross debt balances, just how we should think about net interest expense, both for 2018 and beyond?\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Hi, Bryan. So gross debt balances will \u2013 are initially going to come down about $7 billion, as we said in our remarks. And that will allow us to then kind of balance out our spread. Over the long term, yes, we have \u2013 tax reform gives us the ability to have flexibility with our cash. So we will employ the right capital structure for us. We're going to keep a net leverage position of 2 to 2.5 times and as we need to, yes, we could potentially bring down more gross debt. The focus right now is maintaining that net debt leverage position. Interest expense is, obviously, we're in a rising interest environment, and our interest expense will be going up, even though we are going to pay down some of our gross debt. And over time, I guess, you asked about specifically the longer-term kind of outlook for interest expense. Today, we only have about 20% floating. As we are, I guess, moving over time, more into \u2013 we will, I believe move more into a floating rate environment, as we see the benefit, and that will hopefully help us to temper that interest rate expense increase. But for now, interest rates are going up as we have continued to move our debt into longer-term maturities over time. And because of when we bring back the $7 billion, we will take out some of our commercial paper, which has a lower interest rate. So basically, I would say we'll take a look at the capital structure, always manage it over time for now. We believe the right thing is to bring back the $7 billion, pay down gross debt, manage to a 2% to 2.5% net leverage position. And that does impact our interest expense going forward. And over time, we'll continue to manage that as well.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Great. Thank you very much, everyone. So to conclude, we had a successful 2017, and we are encouraged that 2018 will be even stronger. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations department if they have questions. Now, I would like to introduce Tim Leveridge, Vice President and Investor Relations Officer. Mr. Leveridge, you may begin.\nTimothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Waller, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report. In addition, I would also like to note that we have posted schedules under the Financial Reports and Information tab in the Investors section of our company website. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Please look on our website for this information. Following prepared remarks this morning, we'll turn the call over for your questions. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first and then re-enter the queue after that. Now, let me turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thank you, Tim. Good morning, everyone. We were encouraged with our performance this quarter, and we can report that we are on track to deliver our full year plan. Today, I'd like to talk to you about the performance in the quarter and then drill down a little bit into the actions that we're taking to expand our portfolio and drive top line growth and, finally, update you a little bit on the refranchising process. In the quarter, we gained global value share and grew organic revenue 4%. This was driven by North America, Europe, Mexico and China. We also benefited from improvements in certain large emerging markets like India. Our strategic focus on small baskets and packs continued in the quarter, resulting in strong 3% price/mix and transactions outpacing volume by two points. Finally, our ongoing productivity initiatives helped drive strong underlying operating margin expansion in both the quarter and year to date. Turning to our operations around the world. We are pleased with our continued good performance in North America, and we have full confidence in our sustainable growth strategy. As we announced on Monday, Sandy Douglas will retire as President of Coca-Cola North America after a remarkable three-decade career with the company. He'll be succeeded by Jim Dinkins, who currently serves as Head of the Minute Maid business unit and Chief Retail Sales Officer for Coca-Cola North America. Sandy's done an outstanding job leading our flagship market through a period of enormous system change and has set it up for success in the coming years. We thank him for his leadership and wish him well in his retirement. Jim, who is a highly experienced and respected leader within the Coca-Cola system, will assume the leadership of our North American segment as of January 1, 2018. We look forward to introducing him to many of you at our upcoming Investor Day on November 16. Turning to Mexico, our volume did decline a point in the quarter, negatively impacted by some cooler weather and natural disasters, and higher rainfall as well as slightly softer consumer environment. And in our Europe, Middle East and Africa group, solid marketing and innovation, coupled with improved execution, continued to drive mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. In our emerging markets, China saw another quarter of improving performance, with volume up 2% due to strong marketing campaigns across sparkling soft drinks, juice and premium water. At the same time, the business has made a strategic decision to de-emphasize low-margin water, which follows the strategy we are executing with success elsewhere. Whilst this resulted in a 3-point impact to China's volume growth in the quarter, it did not impact our profitability. Also, during the quarter, India returned to growth, with volume up 6%, driven by solid performance across the portfolio. Our business successfully moved past the recent difficulties related to demonetization and the implementation of a Goods and Service Tax during the first half of the year. With that said, we are still facing difficult conditions in certain markets, notably in Latin America. Venezuela and Brazil were a 1-point drag on our overall global volume. However, there are some indications of light at the end of the tunnel in Brazil where we've seen the first signs of recovery in GDP for the country. However, consumption of consumer goods appears to be lagging behind durable goods and services, so it may take further time for recovery to translate into faster FMCG growth. So, we're continuing to build out our returnable packaging infrastructure and adjust our price/pack architecture, which has resulted in sequential improvement in volume trends as we have progressed through the year. Since launching our affordability plan, we've seen good results from entry packs, which grew double-digits in the quarter. Now while we see various opportunities and challenges in each of our markets, one thing is consistent across all of our businesses: the consumer landscape is changing. We see an increasing number of small and fast competitors; consumers' desires are evolving, whether they're seeking low or no sugar options, drinks with functional benefits or simply more variety. In order to thrive in this kind of environment, we need to be more entrepreneurial and agile, to take intelligent risks, and build a broader consumer-centric portfolio. As we accelerate our way forward to becoming a total beverage company, new categories and premium segments will play key roles in our growth. We are growing our portfolio in multiple ways whilst leveraging the strength of our core brands as its foundation. First, we're identifying and incubating high-growth brands. For example, in the U.S., we acquired the rights to Topo Chico, a premium sparkling mineral water from Mexico that has earned a strong following in Texas and beyond. Our Venturing & Emerging Brands unit will serve as an incubator for Topo Chico and will guide the development of the brand's distribution footprint. Within VEB, this approach has been highly successful for other investments, like Honest Tea, maintaining the essence of the brand and the entrepreneurial culture of the company while supporting its rapid growth phase within the power of the Coca-Cola system. Second, we're building stronger capability to nurture and expand small brands internationally. We've learned a lot from the VEB model in the U.S., and we're leveraging those lessons to develop similar structures and processes in other markets. For example, in Central and Eastern Europe, we recently launched a unit in partnership with our bottling partner, Coca-Cola Hellenic. We will seek emerging brands and potential partnerships, but we will start by testing premium brands in high-value outlets and channels through a separate and dedicated sales force. Many of these, like smartwater, ZICO, Appletiser, will be lifted and shifted from other places. Products will follow the incubate grow and scale path, with a goal to expand fast and discontinue quickly if necessary. Third, we're looking at opportunities in growing premium segments such as adult craft beverages. As you know, more consumers, most notably adults, are seeking unique and distinct products with sophisticated flavors, quality ingredients, and smaller-scale craft production. Mixers are seeing a resurgence in many parts of the world as part of this trend. So earlier this year, in Spain, we introduced a line of premium mixers in glass bottles called Royal Bliss for sale only in the on-premise channel. In Great Britain, we just relaunched the storied Schweppes brand to offer mixers designed to pair even better with premium spirits, including a new range of premium mixers called Schweppes 1783. We're also building on a solid foundation in sophisticated flavors through brands like Blue Sky, Barrilitos Aguas Frescas in the U.S., and Appletiser and BOBO (09:27) in Europe. And we plan to leverage these in the appropriate channels where these premium products can excel. Now while innovating and growing small brands in new categories is critical, it is only part of the equation. That's why we're continuing to invest in our core billion-dollar brands to drive relevance. We increased our media investments behind our sparkling brands before moving aggressively into non-sparkling categories, and we will continue to innovate within these core brands as well, for in the end, a healthy core will fuel our expansion as a total beverage company. So for example, we launched Coca-Cola Zero Sugar in the United Kingdom last year. And with the combination of a great-tasting reformulated product, better marketing, new packaging, and improved execution, this product has been in the market for more than a year, and we continue to see double-digit growth in the UK. And we started to roll out Coke Zero Sugar to other markets around the world, including the U.S., which leveraged the UK marketing and execution playbook to launch in the third quarter. We've seen positive results, including a meaningful acceleration in Coke Zero's trends in the U.S. since launch, and year-to-date global volume and revenue for the brand is growing double digits. We're applying the same concept to refresh our important Fanta brand. We relaunched Fanta globally this year, reaching most of our major markets by the end of the second quarter. We did this with a four-pillar playbook. That was a new look and a new integrated marketing campaign, a new recipe that tastes great and reduces added sugar, a new spiral bottle that differentiates Fanta on the shelf, and improved execution and more media investment. Thanks to this work, we've seen a return to volume growth and an acceleration in revenue growth for Fanta. Now obviously, not everything is going to work. That is why an agile testing and learning approach is essential. For example, in Costa Rica, we launched Fanta sweetened only with juice and with no added sugar. And we learned that consumers saw the new formula really as an incremental brand rather than an improvement to the existing brand. So we had to bring back the original formula and are retooling the market for this new approach. The lesson is ultimately a single approach across all markets will not work. We need to tailor our approach based on consumer mindset and tastes in each market. Further, our model needs to be flexible, so if a brand introduction isn't successful, we can adapt and change strategies quickly. And we have empowered our local leaders to make these key brand decisions. Lastly, moving on to our system, as we approach the end of 2017, we're nearing the completion of the refranchising process. In the U.S., our refranchising will be complete when the Tri-State Operating Unit and the West Operating Unit transactions close, which we expect to be in the coming weeks. This will leave Canada to be refranchised, and our expectation is to transition to a partner in 2018. Also in early October, we closed on a transaction that makes our company the majority owner of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. As we've previously disclosed, we're in discussions to refranchise this territory, and also expect this to happen in 2018. Before I hand the call over to Kathy, I'll end by saying this was a solid quarter and that we're committed to delivering against our full-year targets. We will continue to execute our plan with innovation and marketing by focusing on the consumer and building a culture that embraces change, focuses on growth, and is entrepreneurial in spirit. Thank you and, Kathy, I'll hand over to you for the key financial results.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by highlighting a few key items we've reported today before moving on to talk about guidance. We delivered solid financial results in line with our expectations, with strong organic revenue growth and operating expense leverage driving double-digit growth in underlying profit before tax. As James mentioned, we continue to refranchise our company-owned bottling operations, which resulted in a 15% decline in comparable net revenues. However, adjusting for those divestitures, we grew organic revenue 4% in the quarter, with positive performance across all operating segments. Comparable gross margin increased over 150 basis points, reflecting the benefit from refranchising our bottling businesses and strong price/mix, partially offset by increased commodity costs and a slight currency impact. Comparable operating margin grew over 400 basis points, driven by the divestitures and continued productivity, including the ongoing removal of stranded costs in Coca-Cola Refreshments. Moving to cash flow, we generated $4.7 billion in free cash flow year to date and have returned that excess cash to our shareowners. Year to date, we've returned $3.2 billion in the form of dividends, reflecting a 6% increase in our dividend this year and $1.7 billion in net share repurchases. Now turning to outlook, we continue to expect comparable EPS to be flat to down 2% this year as we complete the bottler refranchising process and return to a higher-margin, capital-light business model. We continue to expect to deliver 3% organic revenue growth and 7% to 8% growth in underlying profit before tax. We now expect currency to be a 1-point headwind on profit before tax for the full year. The improvement in the currency outlook is offset by an increase in the full-year structural outlook. The higher structural headwind is due to the transition of our interest in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, which we will account for as a discontinued operation, as we intend to divest the operations in 2018. As such, we will no longer derive equity income from our previous minority stake in CCBA. In addition, the largest driver of the structural impact in Q4 is from the one-time impact from eliminating intercompany profit from our concentrate sales. In addition, because CCBA will be accounted for as a discontinued operation, we will exclude CCBA's net income from our comparable earnings. So in summarizing the above, for the full year, we expect a $0.02 lower currency headwind to offset a $0.02 higher structural headwind, so our full-year comparable guidance remains the same. In terms of phasing, the improved currency outlook with a $0.01 benefit to the third quarter, and we expect it to benefit the fourth quarter by roughly a $0.01. However, we expect the $0.02 increase structural headwind to impact the fourth quarter. As you model the fourth quarter, there are few other items to consider. First, our calendar fourth quarter will benefit from one extra day versus the prior-year period, which equates to roughly one additional point of topline growth for the quarter. Second, the hurricanes that occurred in North America during the third quarter caused disruption to our supply chain, leading to an estimated $50 million increase in costs, the majority of which will impact the fourth quarter. Third, we expect the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items to be a 27-point headwind on net revenue and an 11- to 12-point headwind on profit before tax. And finally, we expect currency to shift to a zero- to 1-point tailwind on net revenue and a 4 to 5-point tailwind on profit before tax as we cycle significant volatility in the U.S. dollar from the fourth quarter of last year. Now, looking beyond the fourth quarter, we will provide more comprehensive 2018 guidance on our fourth quarter call in February. However, we are reaffirming the outlook on certain items provided at the beginning of this year. We continue to expect structural items to be a 1- to 2-point headwind on profit before tax. Remember, we have a rolling hedging program on hard currencies, so the currency benefit we expect in the fourth quarter should not be taken out of context and extrapolated into a similar benefit for 2018. As such, we still expect currency in 2018 to be a low single-digit headwind on profit before tax. And finally, we continue to expect that our effective tax rate will increase to 26% in 2018. As you recall, we are holding an Investor Day on November 16. During that time, we'll focus on our longer-term opportunities and how we'll get there. We look forward to sharing much more with you then. So, please plan to join us via our webcast. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Speakers, our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Hi Dara.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: My question was really around North American pricing long term. Obviously there's been a lot of concern in general over the pricing environment in the U.S., not just in beverages but across the CPG industry with brick and mortar retailer struggles and theoretically pushback as they look for lower pricing and differentiate themselves or just a margin grab versus CPG suppliers. So, I was hoping in that context, you could give us a review on if Coke's increased focus on pricing in the U.S. over the last few years, is that pressured at all longer term by these retailer dynamics? How do you manage through that? What are you hearing from your customers? And also, just given the new leadership in North America as well as the bottler refranchise, I mean, how does that play into that pricing focus longer term? And how do those changes impact that? Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah, sure, Dara. Look, a few thoughts. Firstly, I think the most important thing we focus on as a starting point is making sure we are bringing the innovation, the marketing and the execution to bear for each customer such as the beverage category grows faster than their overall business. And that is the basis on which you get better in-store placements, execution, and the pricing conversation becomes more manageable because in the end, you're creating disproportionate value for the customer. So, that's the first objective. The second point I would make is we have different \u2013 to some people, we are a very multi-channel business. Yes, we have large presence in the grocery channel, but we have multiple other environments where we sell our beverages. And therefore, part of it is being in lots of different places that helps manage the pack/price architecture dynamics and creates value for all our customers in the different channels. And I would, perhaps, leave a last third thought on the marketplace, which is, yeah, some of the extra pressure from private labels or the stratification of retailers on strategy and pricing is somewhat of an emerging dynamic in U.S., but it has been present in other parts of the world and we have found ways to work with each of our customers to make it work for them and for us. So, we are believers in our ability to create value for ourselves by creating value with the customers even in this ongoing changing environment. And I'll leave you with the last thought, which is, there's no one better positioned to understand this in the context of North America than Jim Dinkins because he's ran the national sales company for the U.S. system for a large number of years. He's worked as \u2013 leading accounts in lots of other channels, too. So he understands this dynamic very clearly, and he has been at the forefront of leading a team to build value with our customers in collaboration with our bottling system.\nOperator: The next question comes from Carlos Laboy from HSBC. Your line is now open.\nCarlos Laboy - HSBC Securities USA, Inc.: Hey everyone.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nCarlos Laboy - HSBC Securities USA, Inc.: James, what might be some of the green shoots of performance list that you're seeing in the North American territories that were first refranchised?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Well, I think, the first and most important green shoot is to look at the performance once you get past the 12-month mark, by which I mean that it's as much like having any new thing, management attention and focus gets heavily directed to new things. And so, of course, you would expect better performance initially on refranchising, and we have got that in the vast majority of territories. But I think the most interesting thing is that after 12 months, when it's cycling and people have got the real hard work of building for the long term, we're still seeing the vast majority of the refranchised territories performing ahead of where they were before. So they've been able to build on the great re-foundation work that CCR in conjunction with the North American team did. And the sorts of places we're seeing that performance coming from is not just doing better with existing customers which is true, but also in finding new customer outlets expanding the universe of the customer outlets and performing better in the small formats which in a way is partly the theory of the case of why refranchise to local partners.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC. Your line is now open.\nNik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. Good morning everyone.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nNik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: James, a quick question on Coke Zero Sugar. When you think about the launch in the markets that you have and also the early data points from the U.S., how much interaction is there with Coke Classic and if you could just give us some context on kind of overlapping cannibalization rates?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to get into the mathematical specificity, but I think look the headline is that as Coke Zero Sugar is coming to marketplaces. And particularly interesting, those ones where it's been there for more than 12 months, a bit like my comment on refranchising, we're seeing continued acceleration of Coke Zero Sugar. It's lifting the whole franchise. Yes, it is cannibalizing at times either Coke Light or sometimes Coke Original. But in the net, there is additional volume and additional consumers coming back into the franchise. I think it's unrealistic to expect cannibalization to be zero. But obviously the key is that to be a net positive. So, we are pleased with how it's playing out. It's slightly different in different countries depending on the mix of the Coke franchise in those countries, but it's a net positive and we are encouraged.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Hi.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I wanted to get an update on the progress from a productivity perspective. So the $3.8 billion that you mentioned last time, where are we on reinvestment phase versus dropping to the bottom line phase? And essentially, coming to brass tacks, how much in billions of dollars should we expect to drop to the bottom line? And if you want to be generous and answer a second question, lower priority question, can you talk about the Topo Chico brand positioning versus LaCroix for example in the marketplace? Thanks. Please choose the first one if you're going to choose one.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Okay, so I will take the first one and James can decide if he plans to be generous or not. So first of all, we separate those two programs, Ali, from the $3 billion program, the original program that we announced earlier and then the $800 million program that we added on. On the $3 billion program, I would say we are on target. The productivity is clearly coming from three different places, cost of goods, DME, and OpEx. And we're on target to do around $400 million this year. And we had always said about half of that would be reinvested to drive growth. Of the $800 million program, that is associated with our Lean Enterprise activities. Those activities really just got started last quarter, so this year. So they really \u2013 and we've said that you'll see the benefits of those in 2018 and 2019, and they'll be split between those two years. And again, about half of that will go to reinvestment and half will hit the bottom line. So we are on target with both programs, and the Lean Enterprise program has started off well so far. And we will plan to update you as we continue to go along.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: And if we have time, we'll come back to Topo Chico, Ali, so that we can respect everyone's one question at a time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Laurent Grandet from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nLaurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning, James. Good morning, Kathy.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nLaurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: My question is about e-commerce. Your commentary in the last earnings laid down the size of the opportunity of e-commerce and the way they were investing ahead of the curve in people and big data, saying that they had a larger market share in e-commerce than elsewhere. Could you please tell us how you are doing after that channel, your objectives, and how you plan to get there?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. Firstly, we over-index in terms of share, generally speaking, online. I think the second thing I would say is e-commerce is not one thing. It's a spectrum. And in part, what I mean by that is there are pure-play e-commerce players. There are bricks-and-mortars who have e-commerce. And you can say that the omnichannel, there are aggregators. Remember, we're not just grocery. We work with a lot of restaurants, and there are all sorts of restaurant aggregator platforms, and restaurants or some QSR chains have their own platforms as well. So there's a wide spectrum of different versions of how consumers are interacting with customers that is digitally enabled. As I said, we very generally over-index. Our objective is to work with each customer, helping them drive value for the beverage category with their consumers. And generally speaking, we do better when that happens. And so you can see progress in the traditional grocery idea of e-commerce, whether omnichannel or pure-play. You can see progress on restaurant or quick service platforms. So there's a lot of growth, a lot of activity. But in the simplest sense, it comes back to the central idea. If we can work with them to help the beverage business grow faster than their overall business and be a key participant, it creates a lot of value for them. And therefore, we have a lot of engagement with many of these companies on how can we help create value for them within the context of their strategy.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Bryan.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Hi. I have a question about Latin America. And, James, if you could just maybe give us a little bit of an update on it's been a drag to organic sales growth and unit case volume, or I guess you'd say it's been a drag on unit case volume. A lot of that is Brazil, Venezuela, I guess the Central America business unit as well. Can you give us a description of, A), how far away are we from maybe the environment bottoming? Second, maybe just some of the actions that Coke has taken to adjust to the environment? I'm just trying to get a sense for how far away we are from being at maybe a clean base where you can start to grow again.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: I think let me take them in pieces. Each one is a slightly different story, although the headline is, I'm hoping to see the light at the end of the tunnel by the end of the year. What does that mean? In Brazil, we've talked about the actions we've been taking around price/package architecture, around returnables, investing in new infrastructure, not over-promoting to try and protect the volume but to try and reestablish our price/pack architecture that's going to work for the medium term. Brazil as a country is struggling or has struggled. There are some signs, as I commented on the script, of light at the end of the tunnel. FMCG is lagging durables a bit in that. Am I completely happy in Brazil? No, I wouldn't say so. I think there's more that we can do that's within our control. But I am still somewhat hopeful that that will all play out by the end of the year and things will start bottoming out in the fourth quarter. It has been sequentially improving as we've gone through the year. I think with more focus and more effort, we can see this play through, and so it will bottom out by the end of the year. We'll see, but I think the signs are encouraging. Venezuela is really a very tough human situation. It's almost a tragedy. And I think that the simple reality is the fourth quarter of significant declines in Venezuela will be the fourth quarter this year, at which point it will have shrunk to a size that it won't be able to impact our overall numbers to the same extent in 2018. I would love to think it's going to get better. I'm not hopeful in the short term. But I would say it's going to stop impacting our numbers heavily once we get into 2018, and then Colombia similarly to Brazil. So I think the sum of all that is what I said at the beginning, we've been through a very tough year. We've been taking action. We are happy with some of the things we've done. We've got more work to do in places. But the floor should be set by the end of the year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJudy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nJudy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: James, can you give us your perspective around your performance in some of the non-sparkling category clusters? You look at the quarter I think the growth actually softened across all of your segments there. Why do you think we aren't really seeing stronger growth, setting aside what you're doing in China? And then I think you talked about maybe increasing investment behind some of your bigger brands. So maybe you can elaborate on your strategy and the investment, whether that will be funded by shifting investments from sparkling to these brands or the total portfolio really looking to further increase investments.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: I think there are a few questions in there, Judy. Look, I think, as we disaggregate the categories, obviously, the categories intersect with the geographies. And so the story is not neither claimed by geography, nor by category. But let me try and add a little texture to what we see going on. I think sparkling beverage growth got a little bit better volumetrically in the quarter. And I think that that shows a slightly improving trend. So I think firstly, the sparkling has got volumetrically better. It's back to slightly across the zero line, whereas it was negative at the beginning of the year, and that's coming with better revenue growth. So our focus on Coke Zero Sugar, the re-launch of Fanta, Sprite in some places, smaller packages, working with customers is getting a better volume trend sequentially and good pricing. So, I think there's good progress there. In terms of juices, what we're really seeing there is doing a lot better on the top end, things like chilled juices, plant-based drinks, fairlife, the premium dairy going strongly, would love to have more capacity to grow even faster. You're seeing some growth in the juice drinks end of spectrum, where there's some volume has come out, it's more in the nectars. I think that's part of people converting up and converting down. So, I think there's continued trend there. In terms of teas, good growth there, volume growth, price growth. We're pleased with our performance in teas. We're going to continue to invest in tea. Coffee, lots of up in coffee. In the U.S., we've launched our own brands. We've launched some brands in partnerships with some other players. All of those have gone successfully well. We've got new innovations coming. We had a bit of a bump in coffee in Japan in the quarter. Not so pleased about that, but we have the plans in place to do better. The one where we have done less well and it was a choiceful decision is on water. In some parts of the world where we have been too heavily into very low-margin, large bulk water, we have pulled back deliberately in the quarter and that has affected some of our water growth rate numbers.\nOperator: The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nLauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thank you. Good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Lauren.\nLauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just want to ask a bit about, in North America, sticking with the conversation around price/mix, so it just jumped out to me that sparkling price/mix is up 3% but total for North America was 2%. So what was the drag there? Was it price? Was it mix? Was it category performance? And then, in particular, if the answer, since I get one question, was it something in water in particular with smartwater? Are there plans in place for re-accelerating that business? Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: So, yeah. I mean, we're going to re-accelerate smartwater. Look, I think the key in terms of North America is to see a bit of a trend on the price/mix. You'll remember from last quarter, for example, that we talked about a point of the revenue growth was extra inventory in our fountain business ahead of the summer. Obviously, that's been boxed out in the third quarter. So said in simple terms, I think the easiest way to understand North America and look through inventory and look through natural disasters is as I look to summer as a period, let's add the second quarter and the third quarter together and look at what we got. And there, I think, you can see revenue is 3% to 4%, price/mix is on average 3% which is in line with the year-to-date trend and is in line with what we did in previous years more or less. So I think when you just look past some of the blips what you see is an ongoing successful track record of driving the North American strategy, reinvigorating the portfolio, a focus on revenue, a focus on smaller packages, a focus ultimately that drives price/mix ahead of volume, with transactions ahead of volume. And I think that's what you saw once you ignore the blips in the third quarter. And so, we're committed to our strategy, and we continue to drive it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nKevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Kevin.\nKevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: So James, just sticking with the topic of North America. But my question relates to your expectations with respect to competitive activity. And, I guess, I ask you in the context that your key competitor had probably one of the most difficult quarters they've had in a long time in North America beverages and they have discussed ramping investment in key categories to address some of these market share losses, which will include carbonated soft drinks and sports drinks. So, you've talked a lot about your strategy, which has been helpful. Can you talk about your expectations with respect to competitive environment in the near to intermediate term and your ability to flex up spending to respond, if necessary, within your guidance? Thank you.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Look, I think the North American market is certainly one of the most competitive markets around the world. It's not just one large competitor we face. There are multiple competitors large, medium and small. There's a lot of activity, a lot of innovation, a lot of jockeying. In the end, we will continue to focus on our strategy. We have a clear strategy about driving the portfolio inspired by the consumer, working with customers to create value for the beverage category, our underlying category because that includes all people, brands and products. We work with the customers to create value for the beverage category, which will drive, ultimately, growth. And I think that has shown that we have been able to gain share over the long-term, on a steady basis, as we have deployed this strategy, supported, of course, by the increased and improved bottler execution investment through the refranchising. It's a long-term game plan. I've commented on previous quarterly calls. Will there occasionally be quarters where customers take certain decisions that cause disruptions to that or competitors do? Of course, that may happen, and we will respond. But we believe in our strategy. We think it's the right long-term play and we will always look to get back to it even if we respond to short-term actions.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAndrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you. James, if you can expand on the comment about better execution of the refranchised bottlers in North America. So how was the performance gap of the refranchised territories against BIG in terms of volumes and pricing? And as it relates to better execution at the trade or would you say the flat fizzy volumes against negative before has been mostly driven by innovation by Coke Zero Sugar, smaller packs? So basically, I wanted to ask you if the 2% is coming \u2013 performance that you had is coming from better execution or just better mix?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: I think the top part of the answer is if all the pieces worked together. It's about having the right portfolio for the consumers, the right marketing, the right innovation and the right execution. There's no question that when you bring all those things together, that's when you get the best possible result. In terms of what better execution from the refranchised bottlers, I think that they have been able to build on the foundation that was created by the CCR team. That was we pushed more devolution of accountability, of empowerment, down into the organization of this national bottling company. We were refounded some of the manufacturing supply chain and execution of processes. I think the local bottlers have been able to take that, bringing their passion, their entrepreneurialism, their local knowledge and turned that into an even better result. As I mentioned earlier, that's typified by things like more outlets, typified by things like working better with the smaller format, yet also, at the same time, being able to increase the degree of execution and service to some of the larger customers. So it's been an ability to work across the board. There wasn't a silver bullet. It was in fact getting a little bit better across the spectrum, from the largest customers to the smallest customers, in support of our portfolio marketing and innovation plan.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge. Your line is now open.\nBrett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC: Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nBrett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC: A question on reinvestment. And when the company started the program of savings and reinvestment, emerging markets were turning negative or in some cases were already negative, and probably didn't get as much investment as they otherwise would have. As we're seeing some signs of emerging markets improving, is it safe to assume that we'll see investments accelerate there? And then can you just expand on what you've learned from the activity you've undertaken in developed markets, and then finally, where those funds, if my assumption that increased investment is coming will come from? Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: So yes, it's safe to assume that we're going to invest where we see the opportunity for growth. And therefore, as the emerging markets begin to bounce back, I'm not sure they're all going to bounce back to the same degree as they were pre-crisis. But we absolutely will be investing to drive our market position. Now I would just underline that other than some situations very specifically, we don't tend to try and pull back very aggressively when markets turn down. We generally speaking adopt the strategy when there's a downturn, particularly in some of the emerging markets, it's better to invest through it to gain competitive position so that you are positioned even better for the upturn. So it's not the case that we pulled the cord on loss of markets. Having said that, as I said at the beginning, we will up the investment as we start to see the acceleration, and you can see that we've talked about things we started to do in India, things we started to do in China. As we see the momentum starting to come back, we're investing behind those. Will it be across the portfolio? Yes. It won't be shotgun. It needs to be focused on helping us achieve category leadership positions or near-leadership positions or driving new interesting consumer innovation in conjunction with the execution of our bottling partners. We're not trying to do more mediocre stuff. We're trying to generate good strong consumer brands, whether they be large or they be niche, but that they be profitable and they be successful.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel. Your line is now open.\nMark David Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks, good morning, James and Kathy. My one question, James, is refranchising-related and how much runway you think you face for sustained improvement in price/mix in Western Europe, where you're a little more into the exercise of refranchising, and also China and Africa where refranchising has begun or will soon begin, simply the price/mix opportunity in front of you in those markets?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: I think in Western Europe, we've had a very good start to the creation of CCEP [Coca-Cola European Partners]. Yes, it was a little bouncy in the third quarter with some localized poor weather that offset the better weather that was in Q2. If you look past those blips, I think you see momentum in Western Europe coming back in and good growth. I've talked previously about expectations on price/mix, where in Western Europe I think we can have, in comparison perhaps to the U.S., a little more volume growth and therefore a little more balance between volume and price in Europe. As we go forward, the U.S. is more assertively looking for a package price architecture mix led part of the equation. So I think that the sustained idea for Western Europe is a balance. In terms of China and Africa, there's a slightly different situation in Africa. Clearly, there's more opportunity for expansion of the portfolio volumetrically, although of course there will be a price/mix element. And China is again a place where we're looking to rebuild the volume momentum with a moderate degree of price/mix.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bill Chappell from SunTrust. Your line is now open.\nWilliam B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks, good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nTimothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Bill.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nWilliam B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: James, can you just talk a little bit more about Mexico? I think you alluded both to the weather, and then you did a little bit of a slowdown in the category. Any way to quantify what the hurricanes or anything had impact on the quarter, and then if there's any lingering impact, and then just touching on the slowdown you said for the quarter?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Clearly, the natural disasters in the whole Caribbean basin, whether we're talking Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, or Mexico with the earthquakes, all occurred in the same quarter, so there's clearly an impact. I'm not going to attach a number to it because I'm not really a big fan of putting it all into the one-off temporary basket, but clearly there was an impact. The weather was a bit more miserable in the third quarter, and there was a bit of softening of consumer sentiment through the third quarter in Mexico. I don't think these are new enduring trends, certainly not the natural disasters hopefully not, nor is the consumer one. I think that will slowly reverse over the balance of the year. We'll see. So I don't think there's a big issue in Mexico. Of course, it's one of those places too where we're looking to work on our price and package architecture and the full portfolio that we've developed as a system over the last few decades there to really be able to continue to drive revenue and I think it was a strong revenue quarter for the system in Mexico and I think that will continue.\nOperator: The next question comes from Amit Sharma from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nAmit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nTimothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nAmit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): James, talking about the leadership change in CCR can you talk about what would Jim Dinkins key priorities would be? And then as this leadership transition happens here, do you see that as an opportunity to maybe reorient the organization to develop new muscles as you transition the portfolio?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Look, I think the leadership change in North America, I mean, leaders don't last forever and this is another one of those changes. There's a new chapter about to begin in North America. We've had a great run over a few years. We've successfully carried out a humongous refranchising task and I think Sandy made a decision this time for a new leader. And I think Jim is the right person. He's got full portfolio experience, he got marketing experience, he knows the customers across the whole spectrum and he has the right capabilities as a leader to take us to the next stage of growth. What does that need to be? Clearly, it needs to be about continuing to execute the strategy we got in place. But like all strategies, they need to evolve in the same way that company's global strategy evolves for the circumstances we face so will the North America one. It's not just the fact that the leader changes that you need to continue to evolve and build new capabilities. We knew that before. We had some things under development. Of course, we'll learn new things and we'll identify new ideas. So I think it's about the continued journey of the North American business. It's a great team. It's a great system. They've got their mojo back. They know they need to do more things to execute and complete the mission in the short-term and to evolve and build new capabilities for the long-term.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein from Evercore. Your line is now open.\nRobert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC: Great. Thank you very much. James, in the beginning, you talked about increasing desire of consumers for variety that helped driving innovation and many new brands, new competitors. I think that's mostly a comment about the U.S., but I'm wondering if you could take that comment and those trends and talk about how that is playing out in the rest of the world and whether that is something that if you've seen it sort of first in the U.S., you can kind of get ahead of it and take advantage of, perhaps learnings in the U.S. to perhaps capture more of those opportunities in other countries. Thank you.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah. Look, I think it's not just the U.S. trend. You can look at Japan where, arguably, beverage diversity is even greater than the U.S. But I think the central point is the following. If you look back over time and you look at what is the behavior of teens and young adults of each generation as it comes through, there's one key fact. Each generation consumes and, importantly, buys more commercial beverages than the previous one. The second important fact is they do so across a greater variety of drinks. It's not that they buy more commercial beverages and drink ever-increasing amounts of the same thing. They go for diversity. Therefore, you can see around the world that those places which have the highest amounts of disposable income, each generation is coming along and looking for that diversity. That's true in the U.S. It's true in Japan. It's true in other developed markets and other wealthy parts of even emerging markets. And so the learnings that are available are actually not just one directional, they are actually from many different places across the world. We've got to find ways to take the learnings from the U.S., from other parts, Japan, from Europe, from Australia and finding the best of the best and allowing ourselves to fuel the diversity of the portfolio, yet understanding that, in the end, what grows are the global brands. I mean, the world, over the last number of years has been typified, at least in beverages, by outsized growth by global brands and the entry of lots of new smaller brands. The bit in the middle was tougher. So you have to keep fueling the machine by having innovation and testing the frontier of variety, yet, over time graduating those to large-scale consumer franchises, not necessarily single flavor franchises but consumer franchises.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Holland from Soc G\u00e9n. Your line is now open.\nTimothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.: Andrew, are you there?\nAndrew Holland - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (UK): Yes. Can you hear me?\nTimothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah, please.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yes.\nAndrew Holland - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (UK): Okay. Sorry, I'll try again. So just related to CCBA, you're saying that you're now expecting completion in 2018. I'm pretty sure that this time last year, you were expecting it in the second half of 2017. I'm just wondering what on earth is taking so long, mindful that, for example, (56:00) dropped out of that process, I think, as long ago as March. Are we left concluding that the business that is up for sale is not in a state where anybody wants to buy it?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: No, that's the wrong conclusion, Andrew. The simple answer is that the regulatory process in South Africa is not time-regulated and the fact is we got regulatory clearance in the last month or so, and that then led us to closing. And now we will proceed to work with our prospective partners that are interested and have substantive interest. And when we say 2018 that's because it includes regulatory and closing approval. So that's the simple answer. So I think that's it. That's time, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining in. To conclude, I think we delivered a solid quarter. We're on track to close out a successful year. And as always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us. And again, we look forward to sharing with you more during our Investor Day on November 16. Thank you.\nOperator: And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Now let me turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. As we pass the midpoint of the year, I'm pleased to say that we are where we expected to be and remain on track to deliver our full year guidance. Importantly, we continue to accelerate the transformation of our business into a total beverage company by driving against the strategic priorities we laid out at CAGNY: mainly, expanding our portfolio with new products, marketing platforms and a consistent strategy to offer our customers the best consumer-centric beverage portfolio; second, driving revenue growth through enhanced revenue growth management strategies and a strengthened system; third, digitizing our enterprise; and fourth and very importantly, unlocking the power of our people as we instill a growth culture and establish a new, leaner operating model. With this as the backdrop, I'd like to talk about our performance in the quarter and then drill down into actions that we are taking to drive top line growth and finally update you on refranchising and our new operating model. So firstly, starting with the quarter, ultimately amidst a weak consumer retail environment in emerging markets, particularly Latin America, and some softness in North America, our actions are enabling us to win in the market. Globally, we gained value share in total non-alcoholic beverages and in most of our category clusters. As expected, organic revenue grew 3% in the quarter. Not only did we see a strong performance in rapidly expanding areas of our business, such as Innocent in Europe, but our revenue growth was also largely driven by innovation in sparkling soft drinks where we have continued to roll out Coca-Cola Zero Sugar around the world. Price mix continues to benefit from a focus on smaller pack sizes. Globally, our immediate consumption packs which are typically sold at a higher retail price per ounce grew unit case volume 3% in the quarter. Taken together with the effective management of our portfolio and cost structure, solid pricing enabled us to deliver another quarter of strong underlying operating margin expansion. Now turning to look around the world, many of our developed markets, particularly North America and Europe, continued to perform well. In North America, improving performance in our refranchised territories with a disciplined approach to volume, price and mix management and some favorable timing of shipments in our foodservice business led to an organic revenue growth of 5%. In our Europe, Middle East and Africa group, solid marketing and innovation along with improved alignment with our bottling partners resulted in strong 6% organic revenue growth. Importantly, though, some of our larger markets like China and Nigeria are also accelerating top line revenue growth this year as we accelerate the revenue management strategies. However, as I noted earlier, there are still regions around the world experiencing political instability and some challenging economic conditions. Most of Latin America, including Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela, remain difficult operating environments for consumer products companies. Additionally, while we believe India has taken the right steps towards modernizing its monetary and tax system, new policies have resulted in near term uncertainty for retailers and consumers that impacted the beverage industry in the first half. In all of these instances, we are responding quickly to the volatile external environment and building strategies that will allow us to deliver value to our customers by responding to these new challenges faster than the competition. Now, let me turn and take a deeper look at some specific actions we're taking to drive revenue growth. These efforts are the result of a keen focus on innovation, small pack sizes and more robust segmentation strategies. For example, in China, we launched new innovative versions of Minute Maid Pulpy brand to serve the premium consumer segment at retail prices above the original version. In Europe, innocent, our premium juice and smoothie brand, continued to outperform with double-digit revenue growth as a result of expanded distribution and product innovations, such as pack improvements and the launch of new, higher-value-added smoothies. Within our sparkling soft drinks, revenue growth was driven by our no-sugar options, where we are perfecting recipes, expanding availability and supporting enhanced execution with the right level of marketing support. Specifically, we continue to see excellent results from Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. This product has demonstrated strong consumer appeal in Europe, Mexico and other markets, resulting in double digit global volume growth for the brand year-to-date. So, we will continue to roll this new and improved product out across key markets, including the U.S., supported by substantial marketing and media support. And with its even more Coke-like taste, we expect it to continue to be a growing and important part of our portfolio. You all know that small packs are an important part of our business. They enable us to provide price mix-accretive offerings at affordable consumer price points as well as high-value products in developed markets like the U.S. This year's success of the small pack initiatives in China, South Africa and Central and Eastern Europe is helping to deliver growth in these markets. Finally, we are looking to grow through more robust segmentation of our existing portfolio. In West Africa, for example, we are tailing (8:01) our package offerings and trade incentives for rural and urban markets even further and, as a result, we are delivering stronger top line results. Now, to support all of these initiatives, we have been taking significant action to strengthen our system. In May, we held our annual Global System Meeting, and the level of engagement among our bottling partners was very high. They are encouraged by the innovation we are bringing to the market and are committed to support our investments with enhanced focus on local execution. And over the past year, we started to see tangible results, starting, let's say, in North America. We've seen continued strong performance from our bottlers as we complete refranchising and are confident in the actions we have taken to complete the changes this year while also improving execution in the marketplace. For example, we are seeing improved execution from Coca-Cola UNITED and Coca-Cola Beverages Florida across the state of Florida. In territories it acquired, UNITED is increasing outlet penetration in eat and drink channels whilst also improving same-store sales with local convenience stores and workplaces. These are the types of account where at the local touch from our network of independent bottlers provides a significant strategic advantage and is one of the reasons why our overall performance in North America has consistently outshined our performance in measured channels. And I'm pleased to say that we are getting close to finishing our planned refranchising activities. With the latest letters of intent to divest both West and the Tri-State Metro Operating Units, we now have 100% of the U.S. territories of Coca-Cola Refreshments under agreement or letter of intent. Turning to Europe, we are already seeing better results than we have seen in several years from this important profit center as our new pan-regional bottler, Coca-Cola European Partners, leverages best practices from its three predecessors and we work together to bring new products to the market at a faster pace. Turning to Asia, Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan completed its first quarter as an integrated company, and earlier this month, we completed refranchising of all our company-owned bottling operations in China with the sale of the Shanghai bottler. Finally, turning to Africa, we reached agreement with the South African government on conditions addressing public interest considerations in connection with our planned acquisition of ABI's stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. Over the coming months, we will continue to work with the various regulatory approval processes and expect to close these transactions around the end of the year. As a reminder, we plan to account for these bottling territories as discontinued operations until they can be refranchised to other partners. As I laid out earlier this year, we are also embracing a new operating model and changing our culture to smart risks and be more growth orientated. As we expand our portfolio, we are taking a test and learn mentality which means some things will work right off the bat, some will need tweaking and that's all okay. For instance, we launched Honest Tea in Europe earlier this year and learned that the brand resonates better with consumers in certain channels, so we've immediately begun to evolve the packaging format and go-to-market channel strategy. We are seeing what consumers want and making adjustments immediately. At the end of the day, speed and agility are critical in this rapidly changing consumer landscape. Now turning to our Lean center initiatives, we are on track. Much of the organizational design work we outlined earlier this year is now complete and we are rapidly implementing our new corporate structure to support faster growth. While these large-scale changes are never easy, our associates understand the need for our company to adapt and I am very encouraged by how well the organization is embracing the transformation. Our system has proven that it is taking the right actions to be successful in the market and going forward, we will remain relentless in becoming a more efficient, leaner, more agile while continuing to expand our portfolio, therefore building a strong position for future growth. Looking at the back half of the year, we will continue to face many of the macro headwinds we have seen year-to-date and over the past few years. However, we are building on a solid marketing calendar, an innovation pipeline, and strong execution. And I am confident we will achieve our full-year outlook. So with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy to take you through our numbers.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We delivered good financial results in line with our expectations with price mix and operating expense leverage driving 6% growth in underlying profit before tax. As James mentioned, we continue to refranchise our company-owned bottling operations which, together with a slight currency headwind, resulted in a 16% decline in comparable net revenues. However, adjusting for the impact of currency and those divestitures, our revenue management initiatives led to 3% organic revenue growth in the quarter with strong performance in North America, Europe and Mexico. Comparable gross margin increased over 200 basis points, reflecting the benefit from refranchising lower margin bottling businesses and strong price mix, partially offset by increased commodity costs and about a 40-basis-point currency impact. Comparable operating margin grew over 375 basis points, driven by the divestitures, the timing of SG&A expenses, and continued productivity. Moving to cash flow, we generated $2.6 billion in free cash flow year-to-date and have returned to our shareowners $1.6 billion in the form of dividends, reflecting a 6% increase in our annual dividend and $1.3 billion in net share purchases. Turning to our comparable outlook, for the full year, we expect to deliver 3% organic revenue growth and 7% to 8% growth in underlying profit before tax. In addition, we expect divestitures of company-owned bottlers to result in a five- to six-point structural headwind to profit before tax. However, due to the strengthening of several currencies, we now expect a currency headwind to profit before tax of two points, slightly better than our previous guidance of a three-point headwind. This will result in approximately a $0.02 benefit to full-year EPS. So, we now expect comparable EPS to be flat to down 2% this year as we complete the bottler refranchising process and return to a higher margin capital-light business model. As we model the third quarter, there are a few items to consider. First, we expect the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items to be a 19- to 20-point headwind on net revenue and a nine- to ten-point headwind on profit before tax. Therefore, we also expect this to result in greater comparable growth in operating margin expansions than we saw in the first half. Second, we expect that currency will be a one- to two-point headwind on net revenues and a two- to three-point headwind on profit before tax. And then finally, as a reminder, our calendar fourth quarter will benefit from one extra day versus the prior-year period. So in summary, our performance during the first half of the year was in line with our expectations. And given that many markets remain volatile, we're maintaining our currency neutral estimate. However, with a slightly better currency environment in the back half of the year, we now expect full year comparable EPS to come in $0.02 higher than our previous guidance. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We have Bryan Spillane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Bryan, your line's open.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I guess, my question is related to the flexibility to spend more. I guess, as we're kind of watching the year evolve and watching the performance, it seems like you're having good traction with a lot of the revenue initiatives, packaging product. So James, could you just talk to us about maybe sort of the flexibility you have within your plans to maybe increase some of the marketing investment, or some of that investment to drive revenue growth, given that it seems like you've got pretty good response to kind of what you're doing now?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning. Yes. Yeah, I think we've said that we're going to manage the year, and we're going to try and put into that balance the obvious building of the business over the long term. We have stated that we'd like to get out of the trend of declining EPS, which we've seen in the last few years, and that we are going to invest where it makes sense. So, we are constantly looking at where that places our momentum and should we invest more, and we have done so. And we have increased our plans in the downhill in a couple of places where we see really good momentum and the good reasons to invest for better results. But the world remains volatile, and there are places where the environment is better suited to affordability, to returnables, to adjustments and where markets are just frankly under a lot of macro pressure. Extra investment is not going to drive us very far. So, we will continue to manage it with flexibility. We know that going forward, we'll have some of the money we're going to generate out of Lean Enterprise, to look across the portfolio, but we're going to decide that on an ongoing basis.\nOperator: Thank you. We have Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Judy, your line's open.\nJudy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Hey, Judy.\nJudy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. I guess my one question is just around your organic revenue growth guidance for the full year, and just kind of how you're thinking about the puts and takes around it in the back half. So obviously, you're doing 3% year-to-date. The full year guidance implies a continuation of the similar growth rate. I think a lot of your peers are actually guiding to acceleration in the back half. And there may be some unique timing situations for you guys, but just kind of the puts and takes as you think about the back half from an organic sales growth perspective? Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah. Sure. Good morning, Judy. I think a couple of things. On an as-reported basis, you will indeed see an acceleration in the back half, principally because we have an extra day in the fourth quarter and we had the less days in the first quarter. So, I think as you look at the reported numbers, there will be some acceleration. Now, underlying that and seen in its most simple sense of taking unit cases and price mix, as you say, we did roughly 3% in the first quarter and roughly 3% this quarter. We're guiding to 3% for the rest of the year because, frankly, the world has not changed. We're doing a lot of the right things in the places that are going well, and frankly, some of the ones that need to be fixed. But we don't see the world is improving rapidly, and therefore we're not banking on that happening and so we're more focused on doing what we know needs to be done and having a moderate view of how that's going to play out in the rest of the year. And I think the expectation for the downhill should be more of the same of what we've had so far this year, hopefully with some of those macro situations improving as we get towards the end.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Bill, your line's open.\nWilliam B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nTimothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Bill.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nWilliam B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: James, one of the things we've heard with regards to U.S. refranchising is that as they've taken over the territories, that are actually performing maybe better than Coke was when they were doing it. And you've seen an acceleration in some markets. They've been a little more aggressive. So, I guess, this is really one question. Is that the case? Why is that happening? And do you expect that to be a tailwind for the business in the U.S. over the foreseeable future?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yes. I think the headline answer is yes, it's happening. And I think it was part of the design and the strategy. To be fair to the team running CCR, they have been improving the operations of Coca-Cola Refreshments over the years and have been getting increasingly better results over time and doing a lot of the things that set the platform for better local operations and better coordinated national operations. But there's no question that as the bottlers have taken over these new territories, they have been very energetic in trying to improve them. They have made good progress particularly in some of the non-directly measured channels, the up and down the street, the smaller stores where they build on their local expertise. So, I think, it is in aggregate a tail-wind. It was part of the strategy that it should be that way, and I think, it's a compliment to the local bottlers that they are driving that forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj of Bernstein. Sir, your line is open.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Wanted to talk a little bit more about the margin expansion that we saw, so 375 basis points on a non-GAAP basis. Can you quantify the disaggregation that you lay out in words? So quantify how much is coming from bottling divestitures, how much from expense management, how much from timing of expenses, which I assume that means is coming back at some point. So really want to disaggregate that and quantify that. And think about how we should think about the sustainability of each of those going forward to really draw the path on operating margin expansion going forward. Thanks.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: So morning, Ali. So the operating margin expansion, the 375 basis points, I mean, clearly we see that operating margins are expanding, when you see that we're at 6% in (22:40) profit before tax and on organic revenues of 3%. The upside is driven by that price mix and so you know exactly where the price mix came from in terms of a lot of it being driven by North America and EMEA in this quarter. And then the timing of SG&A expenses. Yes, part of that is \u2013 yeah, it will moderate over the balance of the year. But that wasn't really the bulk of what was driving that. It's more about the productivity and cost management that we have in the year. So we have more plans over the next couple of years for additional \u2013 for the rest of the productivity and that will continue to drive operating margin expansion. Plus just the refranchising itself has driven a lot of that 375 basis points. As we have gotten out of the capital-intensive businesses, the more people-intensive businesses, that specifically drove that 375 basis points. So we had guided to the fact that our operating margins were going to go up after the refranchising. We plan to be in that range and continue to look for obviously other opportunities to increase operating margins as we go forward. So basically think about it as the refranchising driving most of that, good price mix and the cost management and the other productivity that we will continue to get over the next couple of years.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Bonnie, your line is open.\nBonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: All right. Thank you. Good morning, James and Kathy.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nBonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I was just hoping to get an update on your Gold Peak and Dunkin' Donuts ready-to-drink coffees and whether you think there's an opportunity to expand these brands globally at some point. And then curious to hear how you're managing the launch of these in light of Monster Cafe in terms of, I guess, positioning and then what gives you the confidence that the three new coffee brands will all be incremental. Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah, sure. Morning. I think, we're very happy that we're doing well in teas and coffees, both globally and in North America. Obviously, the Dunkin' one is early days. Good start. I think, Gold Peak is a good tea brand and again, an early start on the coffee. The basis of our kind of ready-to-drink coffee business and strong global position is actually Asia. So we have some strong brands there. So I don't think you should see it as there's going to be one brand for ready-to-drink coffee and ready-to-drink tea across the world. We're going to see some strong growth coming out of Asia in Asian teas. Yes, we're launching Honest Tea in Europe as the joint venture with Nestle winds down teas in the European space at the end of the year. So you will see us use some of our brands more broadly, but it won't be one brand everywhere. Net-net, we are positive on the long-term growth opportunity for both ready-to-drink teas and coffees. We will end up with a portfolio of brands, particularly as it relates to different geographies. And each will have its own positioning, but, in the end, the consumer will decide the one it wants. And if all work, great. If two work, then we'll take one out. Maybe we'll bring one more in. But we'll continue to pay attention to what the consumer wants and help customers grow their businesses by selling our brands.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Powers of UBS. Steve, your line is open.\nStephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you. James, I wanted to build on the test and learn comments that you made upfront and the quest for speed and agility. There's some great examples that you've highlighted today in terms of portfolio progress, especially in Europe with smartwater and innocent and Zero Sugar and Honest. But what I'm trying to understand is, can you talk more about the specific, any specific steps or tools or incentives that you're putting in place to facilitate that speed and agility? Because in the end, I'm just trying to get a better feel for what that looks like in terms of day-to-day changes and how you push for speed, and, at the same time, efficiently manage risk and portfolio complexity as you accelerate into new SKUs and additional category country combinations. Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. I mean, I'll give you a couple of ideas. But I think the net of the answer is it's more of a cultural process than a process-process. Having said that, we're clear on when we're talking about test and learn or experiment, that people need to understand the scale and the potential impact of the experiments they're undertaking. In other words, we are starting to use some frameworks to classify how people are going after things. So said in simple terms, if the test you're undertaking is not life threatening, do lots of them, learn quickly, and move on. I mean, if the experiment is potentially creates a material risk if it goes wrong, then let's look at it more closely. So we're starting to push through some ways of looking at the portfolio in the market so that they can categorize what sort of strategy and what sort of scale of experiment are they undertaking, whether it's a launch of a product or a new marketing program, et cetera, et cetera. And so the risk can be managed appropriately. And it's all about what's the potential downside to the corporation. And that, if it's not big, or said differently, if it's very small, then it's okay to let them go. But as I said at the beginning of the answer, it's mainly a cultural mindset. It's the essential idea that the world is undergoing some important structural changes, multiple ones at the same time. And that is causing disruptions on many fronts, and we have to continue to do what we've done for 130-plus years, which is stay relevant for the consumer and help our customers grow their businesses. And that's cultural. So we need people to really be focused on where do we stand really, to be curious about what's going on in the world, to kind of not look at things through rose-tinted glasses and come to quick conclusions and move on. Why? Not because we fancy it and it's a nice thing to have. It's because that's what's needed in the marketplace. And I think the employees understand that. I think that's why the Lean Enterprise is resonating, and I think that's why it will get pushed through. And we'll back that up with some tools and processes to help people. We're making much more embedded into the organization the use of real agile processes and agile teams because that's the way that we're going to get to answers quicker.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Andrea, your line is open.\nAndrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning, James, Kathy and the team. We have seen continued weakness in sports drinks in the U.S. in the scanner data. And you highlighted also that water, enhanced water and sports drinks were down mid-single digits in the second Q. So could you maybe comment on what you're seeing in the category and do you expect the trends to improve in the back half of the year? Thank you.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yes. Morning. And yeah. Yes, we saw some weakness in the water and sports drinks categories in the second quarter. Some of that was weather in May. There was a particularly poor period there. I don't like throwing the weather under the bus, but that's the Q2. I think in the longer-term trend, well, I think water will continue to grow, particularly enhanced water, premium waters, I think, you see a lot of activity by ourselves, by competitors in that space. So I think that is going to come back and will continue to be a source of growth for the industry. And we will participate very competitively. And it will be a source of growth for us. So I think it's a moment in time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open.\nLaurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yes. Good morning, James. Good morning, Kathy.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Laurent.\nLaurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey. I think you will have surprised many with your 5% organic growth in the U.S., especially after the soft quarter from your major competitor and still potentially with some disruption from transferring to bottlers. So how should we think about the price-mix going forward? Is 4% the new norm in the U.S., and by extension in developed countries? And if you can give some colors about what's coming from price, what's coming from mix, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. Clearly, I'm not going to say that 4% is the projectable price-mix for the U.S. I think that's the top-end of what would happen. I think, it's important as you look at the U.S. result, I mean, clearly it was a good quarter and we're pleased that it comes on top of multiple years of the U.S. business performing at the top-end of large consumer products companies. A couple of points that are very important to note. Firstly, we benefited in the second quarter from a little bit of extra gallons in the food service business that was kind of inventory call that a point. So, it was really more of a full percent. Now we're getting a lot of that in the non-measured channels. We're getting it through the small packs. It's about a balance between mix and rate. We've got transaction packs growing mid-single digits in the quarter, high-single digits year-to-date in sparkling. So it really is a bit of a sweet spot between rate and mix. As I said, it won't stay up at that high level because of the effects of the extra food service gallons. But they are executing strategy, and I think, it's playing out very nicely.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren, your line is open.\nLauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nTimothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nLauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Japan. It wasn't called out much in the release, and Asia, at least for me, was a bit softer than I had modeled. So can you just tell us anything about what's it doing in Japan overall trends across the bigger categories? Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah, let me start with Asia and then work towards Japan, Lauren. I think, there was some softness in Asia. We would have liked to see Asia come in better. I would call out obviously the slight disruption in India from the general sales tax obviously affected us in the back-end of the quarter. As I said in the opening remarks, we think that's good for the country, but it did obviously make some impact in the second quarter. And we're seeing softness across some of the ASEAN countries. Each has their own reasons, but the ASEAN region has been soft. China bounced back a little bit. Japan had a solid quarter. It wasn't knocking out of the park like it has on some of the previous ones. There were some kind of cycling things in there. But we've had some good launches with some local products in Japan, Coca-Cola FOSHU, I need more time than I have now to explain it, but a pretty solid result. So, year-to-date, Japan is going reasonably well. Obviously we've got the new bottler coming into being, which sort of affects the inventories that we sell into them, which kind of makes it look like they're not doing as well as they should. But I think Japan is going to continue to do well. China bounced back. So coming back to the beginning, it's really about India and ASEAN.\nOperator: Thank you. Next is Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Kevin, your line is open.\nKevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nTimothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nKevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: So, James, question on the company's ability and then timing around accelerating top-line growth of the company. So to you and your team's credit, there's been universally positive response from the investment community around the changes that you've implemented. But organic sales are now trending around 3% and you're gaining market share, which is great, but the implication is that the NARTD category is broadly growing sub-3%. So the question is, how quickly can you deliver on that trajectory of about 4%, which is where I think you sort of peg overall NARTD growth, at least something reasonable longer-term? How much can you drive with strategic changes and share gains? How much of this is maybe just cycling Brazil, which is a big market for the company? How much do you need an overall improvement in the macro to sort of take this growth rate from 3% to 4%, and over what time period do you think is sort of reasonable for investors? Thank you.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. Look, I think a couple of factors. Just mechanically, if Brazil and Venezuela had been flat in the quarter, we'd have grown 1 point faster. So you could say, okay, well, by next year, Venezuela will have declined so much it won't matter, and Brazil I think there's some belief that it will get better as we come out of the year. So if you want it on a mechanical basis, yes, mathematically, if everything else stays roughly the same, then we'll get there next year as Brazil and Venezuela stabilize. Now, other countries could fall off the wagon, and so that's always an uncertainty. Having said that, our underlying core revenue growth, organic growth, in the second quarter was actually 4%. So, if you strip out the bottling operations that we know we're going to sell, we talked about the core growing 4% last year. It grew 4% in this quarter. So I think in there is the seeds of that number as we go into 2018. We're not making a projection on 2018 yet, but I think on the line are the bread crumbs towards that conclusion.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Cooper of Consumer Edge Research. Brett, your line is open.\nBrett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC: Good morning. From the outside, it seems bottler alignment's better than it's been in many times in the past. Just curious how dependent that is on you guys delivering better products to the market, whether that's organic, lift and shift M&A or delivering better marketing, investing more in the markets? And then, how long do you think the grace period is for you guys to deliver something better to the bottlers before that alignment begins to break down? Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Look, I think clearly the company's role is to provide some leadership to the system and obviously the marketing of the brands, the marketing and innovation to create the business in the countries that they operate in. So to the extent the company doesn't do that, it's always going to be a problem on alignment. Similarly, if the bottler's not taking advantage of when there are all those things and investing in execution, investing in the capabilities that develop the marketplace, to expand the number of outlets, to build a stronger base of cold drink equipment and the sales capability to help the customers develop their businesses, then there will be alignment problems. So net-net, both sides need to come to the table with that piece of the equation and get it done. And when either side slips, yes, we have more robust conversations, but this is a business that really works well when both are coming to the table.\nOperator: Thank you. Next would be Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank. Ma'am, your line's open.\nFaiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Good morning.\nTimothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.: Hey, Faiza.\nFaiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So I just wanted to talk about Coke Zero No Sugar. How sustainable do you think the growth is of that brand in Europe? And I'd love to hear more about your motivation to bring this to the U.S. Is it really designed to combat sugar taxes that we're seeing in a few of the markets? And how big do you think it can be? Are you going to phase out sort of Coke Zero over time? And is it meant to really target sort of the Coke Zero customer, the Coke Classic customer or more of a Diet Coke customer? Thank you.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. I mean, I think, firstly, it's gone really well. Global volume growth for Coke Zero Sugar has stepped up over the last few years from mid-single digits to high-single digits, and now it's running in the teens. So it's done well in Western Europe, and that's really good. But actually, the global growth continues to accelerate, and we think it has a long way to go. And in terms of bringing it to the U.S., of course, we're bringing it to the U.S. because we think it will do better and help the U.S. business grow. And you asked the question about, are we phasing out Coke Zero? It is a re-invention of Coke Zero, and it is a slight repositioning and, yes, it is about helping the zero-calorie part of the portfolio grow, which is linked to playing a role in tackling obesity. And by that I mean, it's part of what we call the one-brand strategy. So Coke Zero Sugar, of course, is an improved version of the Coke Zero Sugar formula but it comes in more of a red visual identity, more of a red can, with more of a red label, and will actually help people stay in the Coca-Cola franchise. And whether they want the original with sugar or they want a Coke Zero Sugar without any, and it's less switching between brands, which will ultimately help us keep and attract more consumers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next would be Carlos Laboy of HSBC. Sir, your line is open.\nCarlos Laboy - HSBC Securities USA, Inc.: Yes. Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Hi, Carlos, good morning.\nCarlos Laboy - HSBC Securities USA, Inc.: In order to realize the new strategic priorities, can you expand on the actual behaviors that are necessary for the next generation of leadership to succeed and how these might be different from the past? How do you provoke these behaviors, especially speed?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah. Good question, Carlos. Look, I think the first thing is it's going to be clear to the associates why we want change rather than just asking for it. And so part of the task is helping everyone understand the business necessity of the need for change. As I mentioned earlier, the world is undergoing a lot of structural change and what it's driving towards is a place where the speed at which consumers, customers and the rate at which insights can be generated from data to give competitive advantage is changing such that the cycle of speed, experimentation, and learning will create higher business volume. And firstly, you have to land the idea that you've got an ultimate competitive and business value underpinning rather than I prefer X versus Y. How do you drive it forward? Well clearly, in order to get that done, you do need some technical skills. We'll need more consumer digital engagement-type skills, more e-commerce type skills, more artificial intelligence type skills, and more collaboration type skills. In terms of the behaviors, in order to take advantage of that competitive cycle, you need greater transparency. So we need to push behaviors where the information is made available, more broadly, more transparently, more quickly. We need to keep encouraging a candor of looking at where we really are, opportunities and issues, no rose-tinted glasses because then you get to the insight quicker. That has got to go along with a greater curiosity. We've got to \u2013 one of the dangers being 130-plus years successful is you think you've got the answer to some things whereas we really need to have lots of curiosity about how things could be different, could be better, and how we respond to the way things are changing and then, of course, there needs to be some courage to try new things. I talked earlier about that's got to be managed with risk appetite. All experiments are not born equal and there will be lots of tolerance for doing it in a sensible way and then commitment to making things better. And I think all of that can be created. Of course, the tone needs to be set from the top. We need to put in place the training and the programs and if people understand why, I think you get a much more empowered autonomous organization that is capable of creating a better future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Pablo Zuanic of SIG. Pablo, your line is open.\nPablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Good morning, everyone. When I think of refranchising being completed by the end of the year in the U.S., you're going to end up with a very, very fragmented bottling system which is the opposite of what you have in other parts of the world and in turn has been for consolidation (44:09). So why does that make sense? Isn't that a problem or should we assume that five years from now, that system will look a lot more consolidated? And related to that, the fountain business remains in the hands of Coke. I think it's about 35% of volumes. It doesn't make sense for you to over time to gradually convert the fountain business into RTDs, or is that just impossible to do? Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah. Let me talk about the question around the bottling system and refranchising. Firstly, yes, there are some legacy small bottlers, but principally the U.S. bottling system by the end of this year will be a relatively small number of bottlers distributed in a very logical geographic distribution across the country, which has moved away from the great mosaic of the past of the patchwork quilt. I think what we will have is people who are really strong locally in their marketplaces where they know what to do and the U.S. is not one place, there are lots of local differences, but the important element of the strategy in the U.S. is the putting in place of the structures and mechanisms so the system can act as one; act as one with customers; act as one from a production system; act as one in terms of IT; act as one in terms of really working out what's the strategy. So, it will be a strong combination of local knowledge and the ability to act across the system. It's in place. I think they've done a great job over the last several years in bringing it to life and delivering top-class results in the U.S. environment and I think that's going to continue to be the system of the future.\nOperator: Thank you. That will be the final question. And now, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. James Quincey for closing remarks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thank you, Kathy and Tim. So midway through the year, we are on track. We will continue to transform our business and culture, and we fully expect to meet our full-year guidance. So, as always, thank you for your interest, your investment in our company, and thank you for joining us this morning.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference.

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Muhtar.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. This will be my last earnings call as CEO of this great company. First and foremost, I'd like to thank all of you for your support and collaboration. It's been my distinct privilege and pleasure to serve you and all of our shareholders as CEO for almost nine years now. During this time, we achieved a lot. We delivered $110 billion of share-owner value with continued annual dividend increases and growth in our share price. We embarked on the biggest re-franchising in bottling restructuring effort in our history, transforming our company to a pure and effective consumer and brand business with approximately 50% of our Global Bottling business in positive motion. With today's announcement, we're on track to achieve almost $5 billion in savings from 2008 through 2019, through productivity and reinvestment programs. We completed a net total of around $16 billion of M&A, bringing in some of our strongest and fastest-growing brands, including smartwater, Santa Clara, Innocent, Jugos del Valle, Honest Tea and Fairlife, just to name a few. We introduced almost 1,000 new products and added $9-billion brands, bringing our total to 21. We grew daily servings by nearly 0.5 billion from 1.5 billion at the end of 2007 to more than 1.9 billion today, and we achieved 39 consecutive quarters of global value-share gains. By focusing on our Three W's; Women, Water and Well-Being, we've created the most progressive, sustainable and connected business cycle, empowering 1.7 million women in our value chain through the 5by20 initiative to support economic empowerment of 5 million women by 2020, becoming the first Fortune 500 company to announce that it is replenishing 100% of its global water use and supporting the World Health Organization's guidelines of limiting sugar intake. And finally, we expanded our portfolio to become the largest juice company in the world and strengthened our leadership in straw beverages. Our brands, our bottling system and our various partnerships are the strongest they have ever been, but most importantly, and for which I'm the most proud, in just a few days we will be completing the smoothest and the most seamless leadership succession. The foundation of our company is as strong as it's been ever being. As we move to the next phase, I have every confidence, that our company and our system will accelerate growth under James' new leadership as CEO, and I very much look forward to following and supporting him in every way I can. As I've said before, the future is bright. We compete in a fantastic industry with solid growth prospects. We have the greatest brands, our strength in bottling system is comprised of passionate partners, and we have a great new CEO and a fabulous leadership team. It is with a great sense of pride, therefore, that I'm passing on the role of CEO to James in a few days, and I have great confidence in our future. Thank you for your support and your trust and confidence over the past nine years. So with that, I will turn the call over to James, The Coca-Cola Company's next Chief Executive Officer.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Muhtar. Thank you for your leadership over the last nine years and for your unwavering partnership. It is truly a privilege to succeed you as Chief Executive Officer, and I look forward to your continued support as we take the next steps to further capture the full array of opportunities before us. To do this, for these next steps we've laid out how our strategies and operating model will evolve and provided guidance as to our expectations for the first steps and through 2017. So let me turn, then, to the quarter firstly. Operating results were in line with our expectations, and we are on track to deliver against our full-year guidance. As we anticipated, organic revenue was even in the quarter with solid price mix offset by declining concentrate shipments, and it's worth noting the 3% decline in concentrate shipments was primarily driven by a few factors that will self-correct over the balance of the year. Our first quarter had two fewer days this year, impacting growth by about 2%, and of course, Easter shifted into the second quarter. Additionally, there was a time lag between our unit case sales and concentrate shipments. Price mix, meanwhile, was a healthy 3% with good performance across our operating segments. So the way I think about it is we delivered even unit case volume growth and 3% price mix, so we're running at around a 3% trajectory, in line with our full-year organic revenue guidance. And while revenue growth is a key objective, we also intend to do this efficiently, and so the underlying operating margin expansion in the quarter underscores our commitment to value creation. Now looking around the world, many of our key markets like North America, Europe, Mexico and Japan continue to perform well. We also saw improved performance in China, in part driven by a strong Chinese New Year campaign, and India, while it began the year slowly, performance improved with any remaining impact from the demonetization largely worked through by the end of the quarter. However, consumer demand challenges in Brazil and Venezuela in particular continued to pressure our performance, impacting total company volume growth by over a point in the quarter. Now, let's turn to the actions we're taking against the five strategic priorities we laid out at CAGNY. These are those that will help us realize our goal of becoming a total beverage company and to deliver our long term financial targets. Namely, one, accelerate growth of the consumer-centric brand portfolio. Second, drive revenue growth. Third, strengthen the system. Fourth, digitize the enterprise. And fifth, unlock the power of our people. So as we've made progress, let me give you a few examples. For our portfolio we continue to broaden and innovate with new product launches, reformulations of existing products to reduce added sugar, and acquisitions in on-trend categories like plant-based beverages. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of AdeS, the leading soy-based beverage in Latin America and the latest addition to our growing juice, dairy and plant category cluster. This adds to a list of successful acquisitions, including Jugos del Valle, Santa Clara, and Tonicorp that are building a strong presence in this nutrition-focused portfolio. Within our hydration cluster we continue to expand our premium smartwater brand, driving double-digit volume growth for this brand in Europe, and building off smartwater sparkling's early success in both the U.S. and the U.K., we will soon be launching flavored sparkling smartwater in GB. In the sparkling soft drink category, we're working to drive top-line growth through innovation and reformulation. For example, we've seen the excellent results for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. I told you at CAGNY, we'd be expanding this new and improved formula, supported by a new visual identity, to more markets around the world. In the quarter, we rolled this out to 11 of our top markets, resulting in double-digit volume growth for the brand. By the end of the second quarter, we expect to be in five more markets, with the intent to be in most of our top markets by the end of the year. We're also targeting the adult sparkling mixer categories, a key growth opportunity. We feel Schweppes, our premium tonic water, is relevant and appealing to the growing cohort of adult consumers. So starting in Western Europe, we relaunched Schweppes in early April with the intent to roll out to other markets in Latin America, Africa and Asia this year. In the U.S. we're leveraging our digital capabilities by using data captured through our innovative Freestyle machines to identify new variants and flavors popular with consumers. As a consequence, during the quarter we began bottling Sprite Cherry and Sprite Cherry Zero as the first national launch of new beverages in response to their popularity on Freestyle. Finally, we're looking to add functional benefits where applicable. In Japan we have launched new zero sugar products fortified with fiber, like Coca-Cola Plus and Canada Dry Plus in the fast-growing segment, where ingredients are added to beverages to address specific dietary needs. So these actions, along with others, are part of growing our consumer-centric brand portfolio. Of course, generating revenue and profits for the whole portfolio, new and existing, requires having the right package offering at the right price in the right channel, and that starts with a deep understanding not just of the consumer, but the shopper's needs. For example, in Brazil, we are in the midst of resetting our price pack architecture to hit key price points as consumers' purchasing power has decreased during the country's worst economic contraction. While we are still in early days, we expect by the end of the year, the actions we are taking will return our Brazil business to growth. So having the right portfolio is critical, but so is having the best-in-class market execution to support it. To date this year, we have already achieved several milestones in strengthening our system across Africa, Asia, and the U.S. During the quarter, we reached definitive agreement with ABI on its stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. We are now working through the necessary regulatory approvals and expect to close these transactions around the end of the year. As previously announced, we plan to hold these bottling territories temporarily until they can be refranchised to other partners. Also earlier this month, we refranchised the majority of our company and bottling operations in China to strong local partners. And our two largest bottlers in Japan completed their merger. Finally, in the U.S. we closed several transactions in the quarter, and on the 1 of April, swapped our Southwest operating unit, comprised principally of Texas, for a 20% stake in Arca Continental beverage business. At CAGNY I also talked about the need to create a new, leaner, more agile operating model to enable this growth strategy going forward, which included anticipating the structure of our business post-refranchising. And that to capture fully the opportunity before us, we need to become more category focused to outweigh resources to innovation, IT and digital. So we've made some changes. We've created one new position in the center and elevated two others. Firstly, the new Chief Growth Officer. He will have a clear leadership mandate for global growth across category clusters with marketing, customer, commercial leadership and strategy all reporting into this position. I've asked Francisco Crespo, previously President of our Mexico business unit, to take on this opportunity. Under Francisco's leadership, our Mexico business has shown remarkable strength, driving growth within our existing portfolio, expanding into new categories like value-added dairy, and building a healthy direct to consumer route to market. He is the right person to drive greater connectivity across our business, enabling our growth in each of the five category clusters. Innovation will be critical to our goal for a consumer-centric brand portfolio. We have a need for hundreds of new products and continued evolution of our beverages, packages, ingredients and other areas of our business. To do this, we are separating out R&D and making it a direct report to the CEO. Calling it the Chief Innovation Officer is reflective of the need for greater impact. Additionally, as part of our work to digitize the enterprise, we elevated the information technology function and our Chief Information Officer role which will now also be a direct report to the CEO. Lastly, we're working through redesigning the organization to be faster and more agile. When we first laid out the new operating model in February, we were clear that this is about a new way of doing business. It's about creating an environment that can enable growth for long term. We are well on the way to designing the new corporate organization with a clear understanding of what work will stop, what work will shift to other areas and what that means to our people. As we create a more focused, lean corporate center and broadened enabling services, we expect this will result in approximately 1,200 job reductions beginning in the second half of 2017 and carrying into 2018. While these necessary changes are always very difficult, they will help us to do fewer things better to lead and support our operating units while upholding best-in-class corporate governance. As a consequence of this new operating model and further productivity opportunities across our entire spend base, we now expect to achieve incremental savings of approximately $800 million. This will bring our current program to $3.8 billion, or $4.3 billion including the $500 million of productivity that will transfer to our bottling partners due to the accelerated pace of refranchising. Given the phasing of the initiatives, we expect the majority of the upside to accrue in 2018 and 2019 as we have already included an estimate of the savings we expect to capture in 2017 in the guidance we provided earlier this year. To the question of how will we use this increased financial flexibility, our goal, and we're clear on this, is long term value creation. So to the extent we see reinvestment opportunities to improve our current revenue run rate through further category expansion, we'll take a disciplined approach to make that happen, but we will make the final determination on reinvestment when we move into the 2018 to 2020 business planning process, as this decision will also depend on economic and currency environment. But based on our current expectations of the opportunities, we expect to reinvest at least half the savings. So in summary, we are on track with our strategic transformation plan, and as to the remainder of the year, I'm confident we will achieve our full-year outlook and that the actions we are taking today will enable us to deliver margin expansion and higher EPS growth into 2018 and 2019. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kathy to take you through the numbers.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. As James mentioned, organic revenue growth was even in the quarter. We also continued divesting company-owned bottling operations which resulted in a 12% decline in comparable net revenues. Price mix benefited from positive package mix with immediate consumption packages outpacing future consumption packages across all operating groups. Comparable growth margin increased 120 basis points, reflecting strong price mix and the margin benefit from refranchising, partially offset by increased commodity costs and about a 60 basis point currency impact. And comparable operating margins grew nearly 140 basis points as our productivity initiatives remain on track and we sold off lower margin bottling businesses. Moving to cash flow, we generated $788 million in cash from operations, up 30% driven by the cycling of a pension plan contribution, partially offset by the impact of two fewer days in the quarter and our ongoing refranchising efforts. And we received a $1.4 billion cash inflow from the sale of certain North American and Chinese bottling assets. For 2017, we increased our annual dividend by 6% to $1.48 per share. Our net share repurchases during the quarter totaled $836 million dollar, and for the full-year, we expect to achieve the $2 billion in net repurchases as we communicated during our last earnings call. We expect to return approximately $8.4 billion to shareowners in the form of dividends and net share repurchases for the year. Turning to outlook, we continue to expect to deliver 3% organic revenue growth and 7% to 8% underlying profit before tax growth with momentum building throughout the year as our plans gain traction. In addition, we expect our comparable growth and operating margins to expand as we continue to divest lower margin bottling businesses throughout the year. Due to a strengthening in several currencies including the Mexican peso, we now expect a 3 point currency headwind on profit before tax which is at the low end of our previously provided range. However, currencies continue to be extremely volatile. We remain hedged on the hard currencies, so fluctuations and flat rates will not necessarily impact our P&L to the degree that you might expect. Therefore, we will continue to update you as we move through the year. As a result, we are tightening the range of our full-year EPS guidance. We now expect comparable EPS to be down 1% to 3% this year as we return to a high-margin, capital-light business model. As we model the second quarter, there are a couple of items to consider. First, we expect the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items to be a 17 point to 18 point headwind on net revenue and a 3 point to 4 point headwind on profit before tax. And therefore, we expect this to result in greater comparable growth and operating margin expansion than we saw in the first quarter. Second, we expect that currency will be a 1 point to 2 point headwind on net revenue and a 3 point headwind on profit before taxes. In closing, we are on track and fully expect to deliver our commitment for 2017. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nTimothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.: Operator? Ready for questions?\nOperator: Yes, we are, sir. We'll now open up the line for questions. And we have Mr. Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and Muhtar, congrats. And James, congrats again on your new roles. I guess a quick clarification, James, and then a broader question just on the clarification. When you talked about the global macros, you sounded a bit more constructive, so I wanted to get a sense because we're hearing from a lot of companies, yes, January and February were tough, but March seemed to have improved not just in the U.S. but globally. So just wanted to get a clarification there. And the broader question is, as I'm out in the market and talking to the bottlers, there seems to be some concern regarding the focus outside of CSDs. Not that Coke doesn't need to do it, but there's just too much emphasis outside the CSD business where in fact the bottlers make 85% to 90% of the profit from CSDs. So when you speak to them, how do you reconcile that dilemma? Any context around that would be helpful.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Nik. This is Muhtar. Just let me say a few things on the global macros. Then I'll pass it over to James also to reflect on your \u2013 particularly your second question. And I assume the second question you had was mainly talking to U.S. bottlers, but you can clarify that. The world growth, based on the latest numbers from the IMF or taken from any other organization, is expected to rise in 2017 versus 2016 by about 0.5%, so going from 3.1% to about 3.5%, just under 0.5%, and further expect it to slightly improve in 2018 based on the latest numbers. Now always what we have seen in our business is that Industrial Production Index, IPI, goes a little bit of ahead of disposable income growth, and that's what we are experiencing once again here. So yes, some countries' growth looks better. China for sure. India, with the impact of the currency exchange initiative still is moving out of that, as James mentioned. And as well as Brazil and Venezuela I think we can term as being in deep recession. And then geopolitical factors in the Middle East and part of North Africa probably means the balance of risks remains still tilted to the downside, if you like. But there was a divergence in terms of the Consumer Confidence Index since 2014, and that's narrowing down between the developing world and the developed world, which is a positive that. That means the developing world is getting a little better from a confidence index point of view, and I think we're seeing that in parts of Africa, like particularly big markets in Nigeria. Again, our business in China also is reflecting the improved macros. And then we still see growth in Japan, Korea, in the industrial markets, which is a very positive sign, again, as the emerging and developing markets get better. We see there's still growth coming from the developed markets as in Western Europe and Japan and Korea. So that's sort of what I'd like to just say on the macros. James, go ahead and...\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. Thanks, Muhtar. So, Nik, I think particularly, as your question seemed more U.S. oriented, in the end this is an and answer. Our objective is not to run from one side of the ship to the other. This is an and answer. We need the company and the bottlers individually and collectively to make both work, and I think the U.S. is an example where we have a vibrantly growing revenue line for sparkling and a vibrantly growing revenue line for the other categories. We're engaging the consumers. We're improving our execution. So I think it's about growth. It's about expanding and responding to consumer and customer needs, and I think we have demonstrated over the last number of years that we can vibrantly grow both. And that is absolutely our strategy going forward. And that'll be good for us, and it'll be good for the bottlers.\nOperator: Next we have Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Heard it down at CAGNY and then again today that you're focused on becoming even more of a total beverage company, but it seems like it will be difficult to transform your revenue mix quickly or substantially from an organic standpoint. So A, I was just hoping for any thoughts on how quickly you can shift the business mix over the next few years. Maybe what your ultimate vision is, whether that's percent of sales mix outside of sparkling or mix in low sugar products versus today? However, you'd define it or however you think about the topic? I'll leave that up to you. And then second, how big a part do you think M&A will play? Because clearly that's a way of more rapidly shifting your portfolio? And then within that M&A theme, Coke staying within beverages I think has been sacrosanct at the company historically. How open would you be or what are your thoughts on potentially acquiring outside of beverages? Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thanks, Dara. And I'll probably go with the M&A and then the portfolio question. Obviously we're not going to comment on our outlook on likely M&A. I think we've said three things related to M&A in the past, and I would reunderline them. One, anything we do needs to fit strategically in where we're trying to go. Secondly, it needs to be financially attractive, and that's not always the case. And third, there is some degree of opportunism, because it takes two to tango. You need not just a willing acquirer, you need a willing seller. So I think whilst we have an ongoing view of what assets are out there, small, medium and large that are attractive to us, of course that is something that is not predictable in time. So whilst we imagine we will continue to do bolt-on acquisitions, everything else is not \u2013 you can't predicate your strategy necessarily on that. So we focus on driving what we can organically. We have taken the rest of the portfolio, outside of sparkling, from a single digit piece of our business at the turn of \u2013 when 10, 15 years ago to over a quarter of the business. Of course, we would love to increase the run rate at which we broaden our portfolio, and we will certainly seeking to do so. But the law of big numbers is also true. It's not going to magically change overnight. We need to build winning propositions with the consumers, with the customers, and build the physical infrastructure that economically makes that happen in a profitable way. So yes, more acceleration outside of sparkling. While, and I turn to the answer to the previous question, it's an and (30:13), continuing to grow the revenue of the sparkling category, and therefore we will consecutively broaden out where we get to. At some point, will it be more balanced? Absolutely. Will it be broader? Absolutely. But we will look to do the right things at the right pace.\nOperator: Next we have Mr. Steve Powers from UBS.\nStephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC: James, maybe you could just round that out by talking about just firstly, the cost side of that organic growth push? We talk a lot about the objective, which I think we all agree with, but what's the cost side? Will structural investments and growth in new categories have to accelerate? And if so, for how long? But my broader question was actually with respect to the leadership appointments and really the new operating model that you've announced over the last few months. Can you talk more about just how the day-to-day work is to be impacted and improved as a result? And specifically, what Francisco's role as Chief Growth Officer is going to look like? Maybe how large his organization is going to be? How he's going to interface with the other Group Presidents et cetera? Because I guess at some level, I have always thought of the CEO of Coke as the Chief Growth Officer. So maybe just talk about why separating that function out as a dedicated role I think at the group president level, is set up to structurally improve things? Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. I'm not sure that obeys the dynamic of one question at a time, but I'll give it a go and cover off some of those pieces. On the categories and balancing, of course, as we push into new brands or new categories in new countries, there is an investment curve as you build the brand. But this needs to be a managed portfolio. I mean one \u2013 the fact that a new brand is being launched in country X doesn't mean it's not already developed in country Y. And therefore it's already profitable and generating cash. So we need to manage the total portfolio effect, which is not just across categories, but across the life stage development of any one brand and category across the world, because they're not equally developed everywhere. So there's a portfolio management thing. Of course our objective, whatever the category, is to build brands and positions that are inherently profitable once we get to the appropriate scale. So we're not trying to build things that will never arrive. We're trying to build brands and categories whether it's inherent in the brand or inherent in the package size that can be profitable for us and the bottling system. In terms of the leadership appointments and how the work will be impacted. I mean we've done a number of things. I mean a lot of the impact on the work is, it's the nexus of we're about to enter the post refranchising stage. So we're going to go from well over 100,000 employees to under 40,000 employees by some point next year. There is just physically less stuff that needs to get done at the corporate center to support that organization. Secondly, technology keeps advancing. And what is possible to anticipate and get done using technology and change the way work can be done is a lot more today than it was a number of years ago. We need to embed that in the organization. And then the third thing is the ongoing effort to find new ways of doing the same thing with less resources, or getting more bang for the buck, because we can be innovative in the way we run our processes. So that goes across each of the corporate functions, including the enabling transactions based services. And there's a plan in each place. Now as it relates to Francisco and that organization. I think one of the \u2013 the two points that I base our logic to. The first one is, if our principal operating model is local and geographic because it's a franchise system. I mean you've got to choose one principal avenue to organize against. Anything you organize against will have its blind spot, and then you can mitigate against that. So one of the roles of Francisco's group is to provide the global perspective and the category perspective, because it's the inverse. It's a thing that some of the field might miss. So that's part of why the corporate center exists. The second reason to bring all the pieces together is as brands and experiences are created today and into the future, it's less cleanly delineated between a TV ad or a customer program or anything else. There's a much greater intersection and integration of how to engage your consumers and shoppers. And therefore bringing together in one group the classical marketing pieces with the customer piece, with the commercial piece and with the strategy, underpinned with a digital engagement, is what can allow us to more seamlessly operate in this new environment.\nOperator: Next we have Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.\nLauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning. How are you?\nLauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about Brazil. I know you've talked about addressing price pack architecture and trying to hit key price points, but it just looks like the downdraft in Latin America has significantly worsened this quarter. And I know, again, you said better by the end of the year, but are these kind of technical changes, longer term strategic changes in Brazil that you're making? And any kind of detail would really be helpful. Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. So I think the changes are structural and strategic. We need to reset the price pack architecture. We're going to use more returnables. That's an infrastructure and investment challenge. So we're resetting. It's worth remembering that the contraction in the Brazilian economy \u2013 it's contracted more in the last few years than it contracted in the last decade of the 1980s, and more than it contracted in the depression in the 1920s last century. So Brazil has undergone a major economic contraction. So we're resetting what we're doing in Brazil around pack price architecture, how we go to the market and how we push that forward. So it will take some time to get it in place, and also, frankly, the stabilization of the Brazilian economy will continue to take time. Now, the other thing impacting the Latin America numbers, it's worth underlining that it doesn't always hit everyone's radar screen, is Venezuela. And Venezuela is substantially negative in the first quarter, and I think that really is macroeconomic. It's not about resetting our business. It's about the country is in the state it's in. But the Brazilian thing, just to summarize \u2013 the changes are strategic. They'll take some time. We expect that to play through this year.\nOperator: Next we have Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. So I do have two questions. One is on the cost savings. Excellent that it went up. I want to better understand the drivers of change, and I also want to better understand the drivers of the increase. But I also want to better understand the \"long term value creation\" that you mentioned as well as at this point we expect to \"reinvest at least half.\" Is that of the incremental? Or is that of the $3.8 billion total? Or $4.3 billion total? Is it of the $3.8 billion at least? Because you've cut about $2 billion so far, it sounds like you should be roughly on pace to that in short order at the very least, and almost all of that I think has been reinvested. So if you take almost $2 billion on a $3.8 billion, that's already $1.5 billion. So how much of what's going to be on the come, so to speak, what's going forward, will be reinvested? Is that going to be at least half? Or is that of the total program? So very specific question on that. And then second thing is around refranchising, and if you can talk a little bit about some of the potential delays that may happen in refranchising? If you see anything going forward? Or if that's very much on plan? And importantly, if you see the benefit so far of the refranchised territories from an improvement and performance perspective? Volumetrically, perhaps? But even just overall top line? We've heard on the order of one point as you move from company-owned to noncompany-owned, so would love some inkling of that from your own experiences. Thanks. Sorry for the two.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. So starting with the additional $800 million, the driver of the change, the principal driver, is the reorganization of the corporate center, the 1,200 positions I talked about. That's the majority of the $800 million, or a little over half the $800 million. Then there's some parts in cost of goods and a little bit in marketing. So the majority is in operating expense and in the reorganization of the corporate organization that I just talked about. So that's what's driving it, and it's about the three things I've said. It's anticipating post refranchising, it's the impact of technology and it's the choices on what work we do and doing the work differently. That's what's driving the extra $800 million. Now, the comment around reinvesting half was related to the $800 million very specifically. So that's that one. Obviously, we've seen some margin expansion. Implicit in our guidance this year already is some dropping of the base productivity program through into margin because you'll calculate that the revenue currency-neutral structural is at the three, and whether you take operating income is substantially higher than that. And then obviously that's offset by some negative financing leverage. So 2014, 2015 and 2016, I think you're largely right. In 2017 you're seeing much more drop into operating leverage, and the comment is about the $800 million going forward. A little over half is reinvested. As it relates to refranchising, we still believe we can meet the deadline and get the U.S. refranchised this year. Of course, we're not going to do the wrong deals for the sake of hitting a date, but we think the right deals are possible. And we think that we're still on track with that plan, and as you say, we're seeing benefits in the refranchised territories. I'm not sure I would give a specific number that can be kind of inserted over the top on everything else, but clearly the idea of reorienting and rebuilding the U.S. system so that it's stronger, putting in place the different pieces, the manufacturing, the governance, the IT, the way the system works, support our long-term strategy of rational pricing and some growth for continued revenue growth in U.S. is underpinned by the success of the refranchisings in the U.S. And obviously we closed out on the 1 of April China and the merger of the Japanese bottlers.\nOperator: Next we have Laurent Grandet from Credit Suisse.\nLaurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yes. Good morning, everyone. You specified the sales growth by cluster, and that's great to give us some more granularity of where the growth is coming from. If I may, could you tell us more specifically what's your starting point by revenue, by cluster, by region? And also what are your goals by cluster? And what will be the incentive for the new Chief Growth Officer to achieve those goals?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: So firstly, Laurent, I hate to disappoint you, but we're not going to be disclosing the starting point or breakdown the geographic groups as well by cluster and have all of that laid out. The goals by cluster \u2013 clearly, we have goals by cluster. The more they move from sparkling, the more they move from the things we've been building over the last 15 years, the faster we expect the percentage growth rate, but in absolutes, it is worth remembering that sparkling still in absolute terms provides the greatest incremental amount of revenue to the corporation of any one category. As I said, just let me make a detailed point that growth obviously \u2013 we're not moving to an operating model where we're having global category P&Ls and running the business through global category P&Ls. The operating model is to run the business locally, to drive local entrepreneurship and empowerment of the operating unit. But to use the growth opportunity setup to be strategic to make sure that we stay connected to what's happening when you take a top down perspective or a categories perspective and have the rights and some authority on bringing those insights and those needs and those initiatives to the table so that when we as a corporation \u2013 we're not going to try and run everything for the operating units, but we will make a few strategic bets. And some of those will be driven from the cluster approach.\nOperator: Next we have Mr. Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. I'm sorry. Our next question is from Ms. Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.\nJudy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning. So one is just a quick follow-up to earlier question about reinvestment. The $800 million, half of that going back to reinvestment. How would the nature of these reinvestments differ versus sort of the prior reinvestment that Coke has made? Whether it's different categories, or different activities? Just a little bit color there would be great. And then on the price mix in the quarter in North America sparkling up 1%, I think you called out some timing issues. So can you elaborate on how much of that was a factor? And as it relates to sort of the broader price mix question, if you look at the clusters outside of sparkling, can you just talk about how much the price mix plays a role in growing those segments' revenues?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. Good morning, Judy. So I think that the principal difference on the reinvestment of the half of the $800 million is up to now, I would say the majority of what we've done has gone into the sparkling category business around the world. I think here the clear intent is that this is more directed to some of the newer categories, or some of the other categories to drive growth there. So it is principally orientated around growth of the other categories. That's the headline answer there. Then in terms of the North American sparkling pricing. As you say, as we call that, that's principally timing and it's really related to the different channels. The price, the \u2013 obviously we have a large fountain operation which we run directly in North America, and so the timing of gallon shipments, whether they go through the bottlers or through the fountain business, can move the average price mix by North America. And it's the timing around those gallons that has created that unusually lower 1%, and that's the majority of the difference between what we would expect to happen on sparkling pricing and what actually you see in the first quarter in North America, and that should correct itself.\nOperator: And next we have Mr. Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just one question. And I guess from our perspective we get a lot of questions about the total beverage company model and what it looks like going forward, and it's difficult to see with a lot of the moving parts in the business today. But I guess from our perspective, Western Europe is really the one market or is one of the markets this year where you can really see it sort of in action. So, A, James, do you agree with that? And, B, can you maybe talk a little bit more about sort of your planning with the bottlers in Western Europe this year? And sort of how it's \u2013 this total beverage company model has really sort of been a difference in the planning process now versus maybe prior years?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yes. Look, I don't think I would say this is a kind of a night and day change for us. Look, we've been on a journey to expand our portfolio. I think this is about making a commitment to press further and faster and make the full psychological journey to. This is about a full set of categories and responding to the consumer, not a central portfolio with some periphery. We're making good progress with the Coca-Cola European partners. Obviously there we did a lot of planning last year at the setup of the new bottler and its integration and the plans for the marketplace. I think you've seen a number of actions, whether it's the rolling out of smartwater, the launch of Honest Tea, where we've taken some proactive steps with them in different categories. But also I would underline we've been very proactive with European partners on Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, which drove a lot of growth in GB in this quarter. So we've got a great new bottler that's been stood up. We're broadening the portfolio. We're taking action across more categories, and I think that's part of the future. Now, would I say that's the one place to look at? No. I think if you look at the U.S. or Japan, to take two other examples, you see a broader portfolio, and us continuing to invest and expand across categories and even within categories, re-segmenting each category for multiple different reasons to drive value growth for ourselves, the bottlers and collectively as a system.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mr. Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nKevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: James, I wanted to come back to some of the changes you put in place, specifically with the new Growth Officer and five category clusters. The first question would be, when should investors expect to see tangible benefits from the new structure? Understanding that the macro is very difficult and the company's skew towards sparkling. Or said differently, would you be disappointed if the company couldn't return to 4% core sales growth looking out to next year, even if the environment doesn't change very much, including the macro? Or is this just more of an evolution of the strategy to deliver on the company's objectives? And then related to that, James, do you feel like the company has the right incentive structure in place internally for your leadership to balance the growth agenda with profit objectives? Or do you see any potential conflict that may exist there? Thank you.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning, Kevin. I'll go in reverse order. The incentive structure is balanced between the top line and the bottom line today. Having said that, we're going to take this year to have a fundamental relook at our total compensation approach. That may result in no changes whatsoever. We may end up going, no, there's no perfect solution, and the one we've got is the right one. Or we may make some tweaks. That is yet to be determined. But it is worth noting the incentives are half top line, effectively, and half bottom line. In terms of the tangible benefits we're obviously not going to provide guidance for 2018 and 2019 and beyond at this stage. Having said that, we've been pretty clear that we want to be in a long-term growth model in terms of the top line and have some leverage within that. So to the extent that we've guided for 3% this year, we would be disappointed if the opportunities in the marketplace and the macros offered us an opportunity to get back into our range, and we did not achieve it.\nOperator: And our next question is from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus.\nMark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: One question, James. On the larger subject of cost cutting and whether it's $800 million or some added number a year from now or three years from now, could you just characterize how far you believe the organization has gone and might yet go in the area of budgeting costs? Whether it's on a ZBB basis or some other basis to help us understand how you think about the opportunity to do what you're doing today as a habit, so to speak, versus something you do day one, so to speak, as a new CEO?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. We've been steadily learning and getting better at zero-based work over the last number of years. I think we've been getting better at doing less one-off events that then don't necessarily always stick. And getting much better at making it part of our discipline of going, how do we use the resources available to the best means possible to get the results we're after? So I think that's been a steady organizational learning process that's been going on. And the latest changes are just another iteration. The $800 million is another iteration of that. Every year we look at it. At the back end of last year we looked at the strategy evolution coming up, imagining the post-refranchised world, the impact of technology. And we just considered what we could do and how we could do things differently, and that's reflected in the strategy. And as part of the strategy it's reflected in the organizational changes we are making and the increased productivity savings. We will continue to run the zero-based work process, and be clear that the efficient use of resources is one of the ways to drive the top line and to enable long term value creation.\nOperator: And our next question is from Amit Sharma from BMO.\nAmit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning, Amit.\nAmit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): A couple of quick questions. Number one, James, can you clarify your comments about M&A? You talked about bolt-ons are always in play, and then I think you didn't rule out if something larger, bigger came along, you would look at it. That's number one. And number two, from our retailers, you're hitting a lot more focus on pricing and maybe more promotion, private label. Are you hearing anything different from the retailers about price rationality that we have seen in the CSD category? Just to rule out that that's not at risk here in North America.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Well, on M&A we have a track record of doing bolt-on acquisitions over the years. I think there should be a reasonable expectation that they will continue at some sort of similar rate. Larger opportunities I think obey the logic of they have to be strategic, they have to be financially viable and they have to be available. As and when things meet those three criteria, we will look harder at them and that's as much as I can say at this stage. In terms of retailers in the U.S. Look, I think they are looking, they have their \u2013 each one has their own strategies, their own positions slightly differently, so I don't think one can look at them in an aggregate and say they're all trying to do the same thing. I think pricing rationalization is certainly our strategy. We're engaged with customers in, you know, how it fits their strategies, each one individually. And largely I would say that you know, we're finding how to create value together. Are there risks that for comparative reasons by customers or competitive reasons by our competitors, something happens in some quarters to knock that off course. Yes. But that risk has existed, and still exists. But we're clear on where we're trying to get to.\nOperator: And our next question is from Mr. Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge Research.\nBrett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC: Thanks, guys. Two questions. Within your clusters, can you talk about where you have scale or the ability to lift and shift as sub-category from one country or region to another? Where you see the most work needed? And then maybe as a reference for us, can you talk about the evolution of profitability in juice as you built that out to a global leadership position? Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. I think, look, in \u2013 we talked at CAGNY, we have about a 50% share of the sparkling category, and of all the other categories we're somewhere between a 10% and 15% share on a global basis. But even that's a very average number. You know, you can go to some parts of the world and we are clear market leaders, at the same sort of share levels that we have in sparkling, and other parts of the world, we are not present. So there's not a short answer, except to say that we have \u2013 we are going through, and have gone through, and always update the process of looking at where are the next stages of growth both bottom up, each country going, look, I think I need to go to grow out this category or that category. And top down, both a global view and the category view saying look, if we want to progress, actually, we think we need to push out smartwater into more countries or tea, for example, Honest Tea into more countries and that's the intersection of the global growth perspective and the country perspective. And then evolution of profitability in juice. Probably depends whether we built the business through bolt-on acquisitions or whether we did it from scratch. Either way, the evolution is as you'd expect, as we build a good either leadership position or a close number two, we tend to come into a much more attractive profitability status which is why if we have small positions in categories, we've either got to get up or have a clear path to leadership or a some number two, or not over invest because being sub scale is not a part of profitability.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back to Muhtar Kent for any closing remarks.\nAhmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thank you. I think James is going to do them this time. So thank you.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thank you, operator. Thank you, Kathy, Tim, and thank you Muhtar for your leadership over the past nine years for the solid foundation created under your watch. I look forward to continuing our partnership as you remain Chairman of the board. We've already been on a transformational journey under Muhtar's leadership over the last few years as we completely reshape our bottling system. Jump started growth in our flagship North American markets. Increased productivity and launched hundreds of new brands and products. Even so, we know there is more we can and must do. We led a clear path to transform the company to be bigger than our past, to be a company that is bigger than just the Coca-Cola brand, to be a total beverage company that is well-positioned across a wide range of beverage categories, and we are successfully beginning to execute that plan. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.\nOperator: And that concludes today's call. Thank you very much for your participation. You may disconnect."}], "2019": [{"symbol": "KO", "quarter": 4, "year": 2018, "date": "2019-02-14 14:01:26", "content": "Operator: At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to The Coca-Cola Company's Fourth Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. All participants will be on listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations Department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Leveridge, Vice President and Investor Relations Officer. Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.\nTimothy Leveridge: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chief Executive Officer; Kathy Waller, our Chief Financial Officer; and John Murphy, our incoming Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report. As a reminder, we will be hosting a separate modeling call at 10:30 AM this morning to review our 2019 outlook in greater detail and allow sufficient time to address questions pertaining to guidance. We posted schedules under the Financial Reports and Information tab in the Investor Section of our company website. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion, to results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. Finally, during today's call, when our senior executives refer to comparable performance, they are referring to comparable performance from continuing operations. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first and then reenter the queue. Let me now hand the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. 2018 we concluded another quarter of solid operating performance capping off a successful year. The nonalcoholic beverage industry was stronger in 2018 as emerging and developing markets accelerated from the prior year while the developed world held hits volume trajectory on top of stronger pricing. Our business performed well across all key dimensions in 2018 as we leveraged our transformation as a total beverage company. Most notably, we gained global value share and those share gains were broad based. We held or grew value share across each of our geographic segments. Organic revenue grew 5% versus our goal of 4% driven by strength across all operating segments. Underlying operating income grew 11% versus our goal of 8% to 9% as we built momentum through the year while accelerating the capture of productivity savings. This resulted in an approximate 170 basis point expansion in the underlying operating margin. And comparable EPS grew 9% in line with our guidance of 8% to 10% despite absorbing $600 million in stronger currency and structural headwinds than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. Our results reflect actions taken over the past several years to transform our business for long-term success. Execution is getting better. We set ourselves up for the future with an energized bottling system that is bringing a renewed focus on execution around the world and in particular several key markets including North America where we have completed our refranchising activities. Pricing power is improving. We are delivering accelerated top line growth as we continue to implement revenue growth management initiatives in markets around the world and marketing is becoming sharper. We are focusing on innovation that leverages brand edge and retro building, with increased efforts to digitally connect with consumers. And we have begun embedding a productivity mindset across the organization. Now let's talk specifically about how we drove disciplined growth this past year. First, we strengthened our sparkling soft drink portfolio leveraging brand edge and innovation to build consumption rituals by offering people what they want, when and where they want it. Trademark Coke grew volume 2% driven by solid performance in brand Coke and supported by innovations such as Coca-Cola Plus Coffee and Coke orange juice as well as strong growth in our no sugar variants. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar delivered yet another year of double-digit volume growth globally and in North America we reinvigorated Diet Coke with the brand growing retail value 3% after multiple years of declines. Very much Sprite also performed well growing global volume 2% through premium innovations such as Sprite Plus Fiber in China. Second, we rapidly scaled successful brands like Fuze Tea, smartwater and AdeZ across more markets. With the launch of Fuze Tea in Europe we delivered over 100 million incremental cases in EMEA offsetting the volume loss from the dissolution of Beverage Partners Worldwide. This enabled us to gain leadership positions within the ready-to-drink tea category across 11 European markets highlighting what an aligned system can accomplish. Of course driving disciplined growth isn\u2019t just about expanding our beverage portfolio, we need to allocate resources to those brand and strategic initiatives that are delivering the highest returns. To that end, we eliminated over 700 underperforming zombie SKUs. By finding ways like this to reduce complexity we ensure that our system sales force is focused. Our supply chain is efficient and our latest innovations get more space and visibility at the point-of-sale. Third, we expanded our portfolio through M&A and strategic investments. This included smaller investments like BODYARMOR, one of the fastest growing beverage trademarks in the U.S. Of course our biggest announcement was the acquisition of Costa which we closed on January 03, this year. Costa platform will give us the ability to scale within the $500 billion global hot beverage category and create a world-class global coffee business allowing us to better serve our customers and strengthen our ready-to-drink portfolio. All of this shows how we've been pursuing the vision we first shared with you a couple of years ago. Now, one of the most important aim of this work is having the right leadership team and operating structure in place. In 2018 we appointed a President and Chief Operating Officer to bring accelerated focus on execution and talent development. We are now in orderly transition for the CFO with Kathy' retirement and John's shift from Operations to Finance. We added two new Group Presidents with considerable experience and we created a new group, Global Ventures to ensure we connect and globally scale key acquisitions, investments and partnerships like Costa Coffee and Monster. The changes we made are significant and they help set us up for more success in the years to come across our geographies. Looking around the world we are already delivering better performance in key markets. In EMEA we grew organic revenues 7% delivering a second sequential year of accelerated top line growth. We accomplished this in part due to revenue growth management initiatives that focus on small baskets and pack sizes. These were phased into multiple markets over the years. As we continue to build all these actions in 2019 we expect continued group performance. In Asia Pacific good results across several large emerging markets drove our strongest organic revenue growth in over five years. We had a stronger innovation pipeline, solid digital initiatives and steadily improving execution by our bottling partners. For example, in India, 25% of our revenue growth came from new products. And in China, digital initiatives coupled with a robust innovation pipeline resulted in solid performance. During the fourth quarter our B2C business capitalized on Singles Day, the massive online shopping holiday. Both our digital B2C and B2B businesses grew over 40% for the year and now account for over 5% of the system revenues in the market. And collectively across the group, our bottling system opened approximately 1 million new customer outlets. Turning to Latin America, we delivered 11% organic revenue growth for the year as we continued to execute against the fundamentals amidst varying macro environments in argentina. The economy tipped into recession in the back half of 2018, so we adjusted quickly our plan to maintain affordability and protect our consumer base. In Mexico, our business continued to perform well amidst a volatile backdrop and in Brazil the operating environment became more certain after the elections with turnaround of our business there is taking hold and our strategies are driving improved performance. Finally, in North America we continue to deliver strong performance in the marketplace and gain value share supported by a stronger, fully refranchised bottling system. During the year we undertook a significant package resizing initiative across our chilled juice and tea portfolios and implemented pricing actions across our sparking soft drink portfolio to mange through a challenging cost environment while adding over $1 billion in incremental retail value to our customers for the brands the Coke system sells. Due to the strength of our brands and increased investments from our independent bottling partners, we were able to capture price mix in the marketplace while beating historical elasticity. So, lots of activity across our various regions. Overall, there is a consistent thread in what's driving better results across our territories. We strengthened our brands including Coca-Cola through strategic innovation and more disciplined ritual building. And our bottling partners have increased investments and improved execution and together we are aligned with the system on how to capture the growth opportunities before us. Before moving on to 2019, let me provide some context on the fourth quarter. We continue to grow global organic revenues 5%. The composition of the growth changed. We delivered stronger sequential price mix while unit case volume was flat. Volume was impacted by slowing economic conditions in some countries like Argentina, plus decisions to focus on value of our volume in certain margins. However, we have seen a good start to 2019 with more balance to volume and price mix and this is consistent with our expectation for the full year. Looking ahead, we're seeing the impact of some increasing uncertainty and volatility in global macroeconomic conditions. Consumers are under more pressure as we head into the New Year. However, demand for our categories remained healthy and our business is built to perform even if the tailwinds behind us moderate somewhat. Ultimately we will focus on what we can control taking steps to manage the business as we become a total beverage company. Further lifting, shifting and scaling entr\u00e9e brands like Fuze Tea, smartwater and Innocent across markets, reformulating products to reduce sugar levels, rolling out revenue growth initiatives across additional territories to improve performance within our sparkling soft drink portfolio, connecting costs across many of our business units build a leading global coffee business and leveraging digitization to build a business for the future. Therefore, we feel confident that we can deliver against our 2019 guidance. Finally, I'd like to thank Kathy. Kathy has made significant contributions to our company, our systems and our people, working her way from financial analyst all the way to the most senior finance role in the company, truly a testament to the value she has brought through every phase of the journey. As CFO, she has steered the company's financials through an extremely complex refranchising process and she is leaving a strong foundation for John to build upon. Finally, she has been a critical partner to me and I appreciate all of her valuable support. With that, let me turn it over to Kathy.\nKathy Waller: Thank you, James and good morning everyone. During my time as CFO, I've met personally with many people who are on the call this morning, from analysts who follow our industry to investors in our company and many of our associates and partners that I know are listening this morning. I thank each and every one of you and many others for your help, whether it was in the form of guidance, support, plotting or accounting. Each encounter helped me to be a better CFO and a better representative of this company that I love. Effective March 15, I retire after 30 plus years at the Coca-Cola Company. From the very beginning with my start in accounting research I've had amazing opportunities to learn and grow and eventually become a leader in the company. I am very proud to have been a part of this company and this system. Coca-Cola is about experiences and making lives better for everyone who touches our system, from the smallest shop or kiosk owner to the largest customer, those who simply enjoy drinking our products. It has been my privilege to be a part of this extraordinary business and it would be my pleasure to watch Coca-Cola continue to grow and evolve under the leadership of James, Brian, John and the rest of the leadership team. Along with the hard work and support of the 700,000 people who are taking this symptoms into the future. And with that, I will hand this call over to the future. I'll let John take it from here.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, Kathy. You've been a great partner over the years and you leave behind a tremendous legacy. My congratulations to you on our retirement and my appreciation as well for your many contributions over the years to the company and especially to many people in the company. Now I look forward to partnering with James and Brian to drive the business going forward, and before I begin, let me just take a moment to talk about my key priorities going into this role. Number one, will be rise, healthy top line growth leveraging our expanding portfolio. Number two will be to improve margins in all our operating segments. Number three will be to optimize our balance sheet and allocate capital in a disciplined manner to our highest return activities. Number four, will be to drive a culture of agility and productivity across the enterprise. And number five will be to develop our people and build the capabilities that we need in the company going forward. Ultimately, I will be looking to push our enterprise to find opportunities to sustainably maximize free cash flow and returns. Turning to our financial performance, as James said, 2018 was a good year. We delivered 9% comparable EPS growth due to momentum in the underlying business, accelerated productivity, and a favorable tax rate. Our press release covered our fourth quarter results in detail so I will focus on our 2019 guidance. At our high level we expect 4% organic revenue growth, double-digit comparable currency neutral operating income growth, comparable EPS to range from plus 1% to minus 1%, and free cash flow of at least $6 billion. Now, let me touch on the key considerations and assumptions embedded in our outlook. We expect global growth to be slightly lower than in 2018 with continued growth in the developed world and macroeconomic challenges in certain emerging markets. However, there is a significant amount of uncertainty and geopolitical tension which could result in further changes in this macro environment. That said, we focus on the things we can control and the actions we've taken over the past few years has set us up for continued success despite shifting macros. We expect organic revenue growth to benefit from our continued focus on lifting, shifting, and scaling products such as good quality of sugar and Fuze Tea, as well as implementing revenue growth management activities across lower markets. In addition to the solid organic growth we expect an 8 to 9 point benefit to revenue from net M&A and structural activity. We completed our North American franchising efforts and divested our company owned bottlers in Uruguay and Guatemala last year. We also took full ownership of our Philippines bottler in the fourth quarter. And earlier this year we closed the acquisitions of both Costa Coffee and the remaining stake in Chi, Africa's leading value-added dairy and juice company. We expect the net effect of these transactions to result in lower comparable gross margins for the year driven by the Philippines bottling operations. In the U.S. while freight costs are expected to remain above historical levels, we do not expect to see the same level of year-over-year increases as we saw last year. And we have $600 million remaining in growth productivity to capture in 2019. A portion of these savings will be reinvested in the business. Recent investments are generating a good return as evidenced by our strong top line relative to most CPG peers. So all in, we expect solid pricing, a continued focus on expense management, and a net benefit from acquisitions to deliver 10% to 11% comparable currency neutral operating income growth. We expect currency to be at 6% to 7% headwind to operating income as we faced strength in dollar and cycle hedging gains in 2018. Below the line we expect the leverage driven by higher net interest expense and we expect an effective tax rate of 19.5%. However, this rate could vary from quarter to quarter. So in summary, we expect double-digit, comparable, currency neutral operating income growth, but the impact of currency along with higher interest and taxes will lead to the standard range of plus 1% to minus 1% or comparable EPS growth in 2019. As you model the flow of the year there are a few items to consider in terms of phasing. The first quarter will have one less day than in 2018. Easter will fall in the second quarter this year compared to the first quarter last year. Due to the timing of fed rate increases the year-over-year increase in interest expense will be more heavily skewed to the first half of 2019 than the back half. And similarly because of when the dollar strengthened last year we expect a more significant currency headwind in early 2019 which will then begin to moderate as we move through the year. As James said, we created a new operating group, Global Ventures. This will be a new reporting segment in 2019 and will include Costa Coffee, [indiscernible] tea, Innocent and Monster. As such we will provide the revised operating segment financial information reflecting this change before first quarter results are released. There are times our company can be complex to model. For example our M&A and structural changes impact several of our operating segments this year. Our investor relations team will hold a call at 10:30 this morning to answer any further questions as you build out your models for the year. So in summary, we delivered against our EPS guidance in 2018 amidst stronger headwinds than anticipated at the beginning of the year. We maintained a disciplined approach to the use of capital and we are well positioned to capture growth opportunities as we enter 2019. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, good morning everyone.\nJames Quincey: Good morning, Bryan.\nBryan Spillane: And Kathy, just to get in one more time, just congratulations on a great career and wish you all the best as you move on.\nKathy Waller: Thank you, Bryan.\nBryan Spillane: So I guess James, just my one question is really around EPS guidance this year being flat and I think previously we've talked before about kind of a commitment to dollar EPS growth. So I guess one is that's still sort of a commitment going forward, but more importantly maybe could you maybe talk about some of the considerations? I understand the currency headwinds being a big part of it this year, but just what other trade-offs you might have made in terms of what you are choosing to invest this year versus maybe dropping more to the bottom line?\nJames Quincey: Sure, good morning Bryan. Firstly, the whole idea of the in a way the three-legged stool is still absolutely valid and important and just to recap what I meant by that. This is a business that predominantly wins all those, but our focus is on wining in the local marketplaces. We focus on getting the consumers and growing customer value in each and every country and so there is very much a focus on getting that to work and I think over the last few years you've seen accelerated performance of us able to drive the industry grow and capture share within that and that's a starting point of value creation for the Coke company to work on that and making sure the operating margins of how we do that are all the same or better, such that we turn that revenue growth into profit growth at the local level. And then as you said we have in more recent years had a more intense focus on making sure that sum of the parts is more than just the sum of the parts and the lever is necessary to turn that into U.S. dollar EPS earnings after a number of years where currency had eroded that and the EPS had effectively declined. That's still our going in objective. The guidance is where we stand today, it's a really strong operating plan for 2019. I think we are being cautious about the macroeconomics and how that's going to be a little softer than 2018, but a strong plan behind the marketing, the execution and innovation. And absolutely we are reflecting here in our guidance where currency and interest rates and tax sit today which are the three in a way non-controllable factors. There is a long way to the end of the year and they could change markedly. But our focus will remain and our mission will remain to end the year with positive EPS growth. We would be disappointed if it wasn\u2019t positive. But we wanted to share with you where things stand today and we will focus on pulling the levers that we can pull to get to the result that we want.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thank you, good morning.\nJames Quincey: Good morning, Lauren.\nLauren Lieberman: Hey, I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit about North America this quarter. So the flat organic sales growth looks pretty different than what we'd seen in the Nielsen data. So I think a big question would be kind of what drove that gap and if you could give us any updates specific to North America outlook I think everyone is worried about is you had a resurgence set of competitors, is that driving an impact or even how you're planning for that as you look into 2019? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure, yes, we were a little softer in the fourth quarter in North America and I think part of that is we took the medium price increase going into the \u2013 or in the middle of the summer and it took a while for it to flow all the way through to the consumers. That's a really \u2013 I think it was more fully in the marketplace by the end of the summer and obviously then coming into the fourth quarter. So I think you saw a little of the effect of the price increase more actually in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter when the system was taking it and I think that kind of combined with a little bit of consumer outlook malaise in that period of time, so a little softening of the volume. But then it started to pick up and so we started the year well, this year in terms of North America volume and price mix was also continued to be positive through the back of the year. I know it's only comes through as 2% in the fourth quarter for North America. There remain - this carries with it some of the oddities of which business system was growing because the juice business which is finished goods business where we were rightsizing the packaging and seeing volumes go down, obviously finished goods versus the sparkling which is concentrate and it has that mechanical effect that the faster the sparkling business grows the more it actually affects mix in a negative way, but that does not affect profits and it does not affect the marketplace. So there's a little bit of mix and the freight and all the noise, but let's draw a line because the good news is 2018 has ended. The freight accounting issue is disappeared for 2019. The marketplace pricing is clear and positive going into 2019 and the businesses started with a foot forward and so we are confident we have the right strategy for North America and that we will see the benefits of that strategy flowing more simply and more clearly through the results in 2019.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJudy Hong: Thank you, good morning.\nJames Quincey: Good morning, Judy.\nJohn Murphy: Good morning.\nJudy Hong: And Kathy, again congratulations from my end as well. I guess James, just your comment about good start to the year, was that specific to North America as you alluded to the prior question? And then as you kind of think about the comment about increased volatility in the global macro environment maybe you can talk a little bit about some of the key markets where, some of that concerns persist and how much is that sort of factored into that 4% organic revenue guidance? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure, my comment about good start to the year was both about North America and globally. We have started the year only six weeks. It's a long year, but the \u2013 what is good is it started off well in terms of volume and therefore we see ourselves start the year with a good balance of volume growth and price mix that is very consistent with having a balanced contribution to driving the top line guidance and as I said, North America is good. We have seen to have had a good Chinese New Year. You never quite really know until the end of February, but it seems like it has been a strong Chine New Year. Brazil is looking a little better. Mexico seemed to have started well given some cold weather at the back end of last year. You heard about the European outlook today this morning. So we think we started well, a long year to go, great plans. Also that will need managing no doubt and the volatility, so we baked in what we know today. Clearly there are places where weakness is apparent. Argentina went down quite strongly in the fourth quarter and that's likely to continue in the first half of this year. Turkey, very similarly, some parts of the Middle East. We've baked in what we see and what we believe is likely to be the softening of the global macro outlook and in the countries which are more apparent. Clearly the visibility is more apparent in the first half of the year than the second half. Hopefully the world will turn a little and the second half will improve and that will certainly help us reap even more benefits from our strong plan. But that's kind of where we stand today.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nAli Dibadj: Hey guys.\nJames Quincey: Good morning.\nJohn Murphy: Good morning.\nAli Dibadj: I think you may have missed the memo on lowering 2019 expectations. So we are all kind of thinking Pepsi would do that tomorrow and not Coke today. And so I'm a little confused about the drivers of it and if we start with top line, you're saying approximately 4%. Not too long ago you insist on quarter 6% being the right number. Then you have a big gap from that to 10% to 11% OI which seems aggressive, so a big improvement there. And then I'm still confused about the move from 10% to 11% OI to flat EPS, even with FX at I guess, I think it was 6 to 7, that does not jive as what we're seeing from a currency level today, so you are assuming things are getting worse. I see the taxes change that you're describing I don\u2019t really know why. So I know you've tried to explain in bits and pieces but there are a lot of moving parts and I want to understand the moving parts. I don't want to wait until 10:30. I don\u2019t think any many of us do, so to at least understand the drivers of why we're getting so disappointed her both on top line and on the EPS? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Well I think at the highest level the story is a simple story. We started off last year, well obviously we had the long term growth model of 4% to 6% on the top line. We've been delivering within that range for the last six quarters. We are being prudent in our outlook for 2019 given the multiple reductions in global economic growth outlook for 2019 and our own experience in some of the emerging and developing markets. I think 4 is a prudent number. We have a strong plan that's backed up by the marketing, the innovation and the execution. So I think we're going to be in great shape on growing, continuing to grow the top line and I think that number will end up being at the higher end of consumer products companies in terms of revenue growth for 2019 in the same way the number for 2018 was at the high end of consumer products companies. You're seeing then the benefits of a lot of our actions over the last number of years in terms of productivity, in terms of our focus on smaller packages, and revenue growth, and innovation, and premiumization of our portfolio such that we are getting operating leverage. Operating leverage is not just driven by productivity, but by better work on the portfolio, and you see that flowing through obviously with some of the tailwinds from the acquisitions and the divestitures. A small piece, so that we're getting excellent leverage from our revenue growth into our operating income growth at the 10% to 11%. Obviously the currency is where it is. That is currencies as they stand today we're not making a forecast as to what the currencies will be by the end of the year. There is a piece of that that we're cycling hedging gains in 2018 as we commented earlier. But the number of the 6 to 7 is as things stand today. How it will stand at the end of the year we will see. And then of course we're losing some leverage from operating income. Finally down to EPS through the higher tax rates which the Fed has taken through the year and through the changes in the tax rates. The interest rates from the Fed and the tax rates, the tax rate is going to be slightly higher in 2019 than it was in \u201818. So that's pretty straightforward. Clearly that's leading to EPS growth. That is not what we aspire to. We're going to focus on controlling what we can control and driving the business. We'll be pulling the levers as I talked about earlier on the call to make sure we focus on our aspirations of turning our winning local plans into growth of dollar EPS. But we want to be prudent in our outlook guidance given the macro environment, despite a strong good momentum winning plan and to put the FX as it stands today. The only thing that is for sure is it will be different tomorrow and we will update it as we go through the year.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hi guys.\nJames Quincey: Hi, Dara.\nDara Mohsenian: So I just wanted to quickly clarify your answer to Bryan's question earlier. I understand that 2019 underlying profit outlook is solid ex-items if in fact you deliver it. But I think you had intimated before that you were really looking to drive earnings growth even in the face of FX pressures. So obviously we've talked about 2019 guidance already, but as we think about the earnings trajectory post 2019 is it more in line with the long term algorithm that you guys have outlined plus or minus currency or do you still think there's some levers that you can pull over time that even if FX continues to be unfavorable, you can hit your earnings growth targets? I don't know if that will count as my question or not, but first maybe clarify that and if I can ask another and you're ready to be generous, go ahead if not move to the next person. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Okay, I think it sort of seems all wrapped up in one burst of the same idea. We are committed to growing the earnings of the company. I mean, in simple terms, the earnings of the company are the fuel to pay the dividends of the company and drive the stock price and reinvest back in the business. So without dollar increased earnings of EPS it is not going to be a growth company and therefore we reaffirmed the long term growth model at some of our previous investor presentations, the 4 to 6 on revenue and the growth in EPS. Yes, there'll be years where currency will weigh on it more heavily. We certainly have the aspiration that there will be no negative years. We have said we will not do things that are irrational just to get a positive EPS, but we will focus on trying to pull levers to get there. But as you look out into the future, we absolutely expect to keep focusing on coming back to the long term growth mode. Now, to the question well what happens if the dollar always gets stronger? Well, then that simply put assuming that there still is a global trading system that will export inflation to the other parts of the world. And therefore, if we enter some very long extended period of dollar strengthening then we will logically expect to see higher pricing in other parts of the world that will compensate for some prolonged ongoing strengthening of the dollar. So either way we want to get back to our long term growth model in dollars realized for the shareholders.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nSteve Powers: Thank you very much. Kathy, thank you from me as well, and best wishes for the future and John, my congratulations again on the new role. James, for USA good job and I'm actually my gift to you is I am going to ask Kathy and/or John a question, related to the to the free cash flow guidance for next year. It implies another year of about two thirds conversion of net income to free cash flow which is below the company's 90% plus target. So I'm assuming there's still a good number of structural costs flowing through with respect to refranchising and the recent acquisitions, but can you help us get underneath those dynamics at all and paint a picture of what it will take to get back to that or get to that 90% plus conversion ratio on a consistent basis and can we can we look to 2020 to be that year of inflection?\nJohn Murphy: So let me start, for 2019 while your cash from operations is expected to increase at least 10% it's going to be largely offset by increased CapEx from a free cash flow standpoint and that's increased CapEx is primarily due to three factors. One is the acquisition of costs and some CapEx related to investing for the future there. Secondly, with BIG [ph] taking on the Philippines and then thirdly, we have a couple of strategic initiatives in the digital arena and in our concentrate business to invest in 2019. As we go forward, we do have a clear line of sight to get to the 90% to 95%. One area of focus is going to be to drive greater efficiencies in working capital productivity. Secondly, it would be to reduce the cash flow impact from the timing of payments of onetime items related to restructuring and re-franchising. And then finally, we would love to see some of our upfront CapEx investments scaling back. So whether it's 2020 or 2021, I think it's too early to say, but clearly the focus is to have that number back to the 95%, so I think we have a very clear line of sight as to how to get there.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good morning everyone. I wanted to circle back to your top line guidance which James you did mention is prudent. So I guess, I was hoping you could drill down a little further and give us a sense as to how fast you expect your different category questions to grow over the next year and then maybe where you see potential for faster growth? I guess I'm just trying to understand how we should think about your sparkling cluster growth for instance versus some of the other clusters like tea and coffee, especially everything that you've done last year and then possibly touch on your juice and dairy? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I think that, well firstly, before I jump into the clusters, I think that some of the prudence is being derived from developing and emerging markets, whether it - that be some of the ones like Argentina or Turkey, aforementioned Middle East and some parts of Africa as well. So I think the prudence on the softening is more geographic based than it is cluster based. Having said that, I think we are expecting to see in 2019 continued growth of the sparkling category. We've clearly aimed going into the future to see a strategy that is more price mix than volume in the developed markets and more perhaps volume centered in the developing emerging, so as we look out into 2019 I expect the sparkling business to continue to grow and I think we'll see a little more price mix than volume given some of the things that are happening in the developing markets. As we move through some of the other categories, I mean clearly coffee is going to grow much faster because of the incorporation of posture and as we start to realize that synergy plans. But that's not driving obviously the 4% organic which is like for like so it doesn't include the acquisition in that sense. In terms of tea, we're expecting to do better in tea in 2019 than we did in 2018. 2018 has the kind of base effect of pulling out of the beverage partners worldwide joint venture which where we counted volume but we didn't count revenue, and then obviously that sort of made it very hard to cycle the volume in 2018 but made it easier to get the revenue. As we go into 2019 we expect to see continued growth in tea in Fuse and leverage Gold Peak in the U.S. which should see a bit more balanced growth. In juice will come off the period of the rightsizing of the packaging in North America. And so I think we will see a better performance from the juice business particularly the premium end of the juice business that speculate may be part of the world where we will question some of the juice drinks and the values that they bring. Obviously in aggregate juice will do better because we'll have the incorporation of tea which is a great business in West Africa. But that's not part of the organic growth drivers. And then in hydration we'll be focused on more of the premium parts of hydration whether it be sports drinks, leveraging our partnership with BODYARMOR, driving things like Topo Chico and smartwater or smartwater with its new variants like alkaline. We still may see some backing off of very low value water in some parts of the world. So I think you'll see positive results in the in the different clusters going forward and I think versus 2018 you're likely to see a continued strong picture across the portfolio. I think the places where you would see some, places where we would sacrifice some volume would be the lower value end of water and juice drinks, but otherwise a strong focus across the portfolio and balanced growth.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.\nLaurent Grandet: Yes, good morning James, Kathy, and welcome John. Kathy, I mean congrats on your extremely successful carry out Coke proscenium [ph]. I'd like to thank you for helping me head back into the Coke system a few years ago. Really a question about Costa, you mentioned at the time of the acquisition that Costa would be a slightly accretive to earnings in first full year, in the current context of the UK economic and political situation and a potential hung Brexit looming, did that change? And if you can update us more on the Costa integration and the expansion plan and specifically we'd like to understand if you are planning to refranchise this still 51% fully owned stores? Thank you very much.\nJames Quincey: Sure, look on the Costa thing obviously we managed, the team did a great job in closing the acquisition well ahead of schedule in January rather than April and we're now in the phase of the transition period of really connecting, it in a systems sense and also being able to finally sit down with management and bring together that kind of base underlying growth plan with our views on synergies and acceleration. That's a process that's going to take a little bit of time to work through to really validate all those synergy plans. Once we got to the end of that process of course we'll be able to come out and be more specific about how we see the cost being rolled out against our coffee strategy of driving coffee against the pillars using the stores that we have as the experience, serving as a provider of a total beverage portfolio in foodservice, whether it's beans or machines or the vending, selling the coffee at the at home and of course the potential for ready-to-drink. So that's the strategy remains clear. We're putting more flesh and detail on the bones of the plans as it rolls out. And then of course you know Brexit will be Brexit. I'm not sure anyone knows how it's going to end at this stage. We clearly have contingency plans for this business and for our other businesses in the UK and in the European environment. It's something that will be have to manage through, but it will be, whatever it is going to be, it is likely to only be a short term disruption effect if indeed it ends up in that scenario and we will manage through it.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nKevin Grundy: Thanks. Good morning everyone.\nJames Quincey: Good morning, Kevin.\nJames Quincey:\nKevin Grundy: I wanted to come back to advertising and marketing levels in the 2019 outlook and what's embedded in your guidance because as was alluded to earlier in the call, the market widely expects higher investment from Pepsi, this year likely directed at North America Beverages and we'll find out less than 24 hours whether that's true or not. So can you talk about advertising and marketing levels for fiscal \u201819? Does that look similar as a percent of sales, higher as a percent of sales, many companies in CPG will guide on that. So I'm not sure if you can comment on it. And then number two to that, have you left adequate cushion in your guidance should you need to react to higher levels of investment spending? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Look we grew advertising spend in 2018. We expect to grow our advertising spend in 2019. Of course, we continue to work on how to drive productivity in our non-working marketing investments and to leverage our scale with our advertising partners and with our property. So we're going to continue to invest in advertising. I think it's also worth saying that we are being even more disciplined as we look through the framework of leader, challenger and explorer. Obviously is our leader brands which are the brands that make best use of TV commercial, advertising spend. As we drive the challenges and the explorer brands, there in some other parts of the marketing mix that often become a more predominant element of making them work. And then, if our competitors are going to increase investment, you know what it is going to increase the growth of the categories. Ultimately, if there are more competitors investing, it drives more market growth. We believe that we have strong brands and strong plans. And I think net-net it's going to be overall beneficial to the industry.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Hello. Hi. So thank you and good morning. Kathy, I wanted again to thank you for your leadership and legacy and all the best to you and John in the new role. So thank you. So I was hoping if you could revisit the 2020 operating margin expansion targets that you outlined at CAGNY last year of 34% plus. I realize there have been a number of key changes in accounting and acquisitions and FX is there, but with the guidance that you have now implying operating margins now year-on-year in 2019 and the noise like the puts and takes, but how should we think about the reinvestments and other moving pieces that relates to the 2020 target?\nJames Quincey: Yes, so the 34% target that was outlined is one that was outlined I think at the time to provide guidance to the refranchising process and today we are on track to get to that 34% over the next couple of years. We've had some margin expansion over the last couple of years and there's implied margin expansion in our 2019 numbers. However, given the fact that we have new businesses coming into the mix, I would like to really focus on improving margins across all of our different business segments as we go into 2019, 2020. Maintaining the underlying objective outlined in the 34% margin target, but being a lot more focused on making sure that our core business, our Global Ventures business and our BIG business are delivering margin expansion as they develop their respective portfolios and businesses.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great, thank you very much. Over the last year, year and a half or so, you've been more assertive on taking price and driving that in North America and then in Europe and we see some of the results. But I was wondering if you could kind of stand back and give us an assessment of what you've learned from that change in tactics or strategy if you will. And in terms of your brand equity and need to perhaps tweak investment in certain areas, your bottler execution in terms of executing on those price increases and then obviously kind of the general customer demand suggests you know kind of big picture what you've learned from the price initiatives over the last year or so? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure, Robert. Look, I think the simple conclusion is the following. If we just think we can depend on headline rate increases in the absence of other everything else then we're very likely to see high elasticity. And therefore what we've learned and I guess relearned is that it's really important that pricing become part of our strategy. A strategy that starts with the right brands, the investment behind the brands to build equity with the consumers and then to provide the consumers the innovation not just in the brands and the product, but also in the packaging that allows pricing to be taken sometimes with the headline price, sometimes through mix. And there's the sum of all those pieces backed up by good execution that creates the willingness of the customer to go with the plan because it creates more value for the customers in their stores often the beverage industry then grows faster than the average, and so the learning and the relearning it's the complex task of pulling all the pieces together that earns you the opportunity to drive price mix, perhaps ahead of where we had been. And I think that's something that we and the bottling partners have dedicated ourselves to even more over the last number of years, I think it's showing through in some of the headline numbers that you see and we absolutely are going to stick to strategy.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Carlos Laboy with HSBC. Your line is now open.\nCarlos Laboy: Yes, good morning.\nJames Quincey: Good morning.\nJohn Murphy: Good morning.\nCarlos Laboy: James, your Brazil business looked unbelievable last week. Lots of innovation and new SKUs, but how do you see beer in Brazil and the importance of keeping these Coke bottlers competitive on beer? And while on the subject of M&A if you could just give us a quick update on the refranchising process in general and the urgency to see through the sale of the remaining properties?\nJames Quincey: Sure. Well thank you for the feedback on the Brazil business. I'm sure the Brazil team will be pleased with that. They have had a number of years trying very hard to adapt and update the business and bring the affordability and the innovation in line with the marketplace. And I think with the improvements in the macro conditions in Brazil that business is starting to do a lot better and it's a multi-channel business and they distribute the beer only in some of those channels. So that's a work in progress as the relationship with Heineken is a question. And I think as we see the refranchising business or the refranchising strategy, we've largely refranchised the world. We're down to just a small percentage of the volume. It's been very successful whether it was North America, the creation of bottlers like European Partners or the Japan bottler. And so we think that has been very successful. Clearly, we're still working on our beverages Africa, in terms of refranchising started it has obviously been slower than anyone would have liked. I think some of that has been process and macros related. We're still working on that one. And that leaves us obviously with the Southeast Asian set of bottlers. Obviously, we'll be thinking about what's the right strategic direction for that part of the world. But the ongoing, you know curation of refranchising is not refranchising for the sake of franchising. It's in the service of creating a stronger and more energized bottling system that is aligned set of partners with the company to drive our collective business with more growth and with better margins into the future and that takes different forms and places and of course we allocate capital within the process whether it's owning bottlers or having stakes in bottlers. We drive that process with the objective of using capital as and when necessary, sometimes yes, sometimes no, to get the most energized bottling system out there and bringing new partners in. That's an ongoing management as we curate our remaining bottling operations and some of our other investments in bottlers.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference.

Now, let me turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We've had another solid quarter that has included a number of notable developments, from M&A to changes in our leadership team. And I'll come to all of that shortly, but let me start by focusing on our quarter and our year to-date performance. We are gaining share in a growing industry. Industry growth has improved from last year, driven by better results across both developed and emerging markets. Some large emerging markets like China, India and Brazil, are clearly doing better. Others like Argentina, South Africa and the Middle East, are not doing so well. But collectively, we are seeing solid results. We've been capturing more than our fair share of growth as we've continued to execute on our transformation as a total beverage company. And notably, the industry has seen better performance within the global sparkling soft drink category, delivering both volume and value growth year-to-date. Turning to our operational performance, we are managing our business well across key dimensions. Organic revenue is up 5% year-to-date, driven by strength across all operating segments. Unit case volume is up 2%, led by Trademark Coca-Cola, which grew 3% globally. Comparable EPS is up 8% year-to-date, in line with our guidance of 8% to 10% for the full year. This is despite significantly stronger currency headwinds than we anticipated at the beginning of 2018. We accomplished this through a combination of top-line growth and productivity initiatives as driving underline margin expansion even as we continue to invest back in the marketing and face a rising cost environment. Finally, our top and bottom-line growth is broad-based. Developed markets have grown organic revenues low single digits year-to-date, and our emerging and developing markets have grown double digits year-to-date. Turning to our geographic performance in the quarter, in EMEA, we grew organic revenue 9%, benefiting from solid operational price/mix as well as from geographic mix. During the quarter, we saw strong growth across Europe, driven by Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Fuze Tea and innocent, all helped by good weather. In some of the emerging and developing markets like Turkey and the Middle East, the macroeconomic environment is tough, but ongoing packaging and pricing initiatives are helping us deliver solid revenue growth while staying affordable. Turning to Asia Pacific, despite cycling a more difficult comparison period, strong performance in China and India drove another quarter of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for the segment. In Japan, a solid innovation pipeline was overshadowed by natural disasters in July and September, which included a flood that destroyed a production facility for our bottler, impacting our capacity. Looking ahead, we'll continue working closely with our bottler to minimize the impact and protect our position in the market. In Latin America, we delivered 19% organic revenue growth for the quarter as we continued to execute against the fundamentals amid a variety of macroeconomic environments. Now worth noting, 9 points of that growth is due to the timing of concentrate shipments in Brazil, which will reverse out in the fourth quarter. However, even after adjusting for this timing element, we still delivered double-digit top-line growth in the quarter. In Brazil, our business continued its recovery, with volume growth accelerating to 3% in the quarter, driven by positive performance in all category clusters. Argentina, on the other hand, faces increasingly challenging macro conditions, so we're focusing on expanding our returnable packaging infrastructure and adjusting our price/pack architecture to maintain key price points and affordability. It's a playbook we understand, even one I've personally managed before. Mexico. Mexico continues to perform well, benefiting from new product launches and strong growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, supported by solid execution from our bottling system. Finally, North America, we continue to deliver strong performance in the marketplace and gain value share. During the quarter, our system took a price increase to address pressure from higher import and transportation costs. As a result, our price/mix improved 3 points sequentially, resulting in a slight positive price/mix for the first quarter this year. And we continue to deliver strong performance, especially within the Zero Sugar portfolio. This, in turn, led to accelerated organic revenue growth of 2% and comparable operating income growth of 5% in the third quarter. Now, let's talk a bit about how we're driving disciplined growth in the business. Of course, it all starts with the consumer. Over the last few calls, we've discussed how we've been leveraging innovations, like Coke with coffee, to grow our portfolio by addressing key consumption occasions. And also how we're lifting, shifting and scaling successful brands, like Fuze Tea, across multiple markets. However, there are times when we need or want to look externally and leverage M&A to drive our total beverage portfolio. M&A, of course, is not a strategy in of itself. It's an enabler of our strategy. And while the focus of M&A continuously evolves, what's consistent is we remain disciplined about our allocation of capital and about the mission of M&A as an enabler. Over the last few months, we've announced quite a few acquisitions and investments. Each one is part of our larger strategy to broaden our consumer-centric portfolio, but don't read too much into the number of transactions in a single quarter and extrapolate that as the pace of activity going forward. We, of course, use M&A for many purposes: to fill gaps in our portfolio, yes; enter emerging categories; or even obtain capabilities or platforms that complement our existing strengths. And we look for opportunity to create value by scaling brands to be bigger and better than they already are. In North America, we invested in BODYARMOR, a premium sports performance and hydration brand that's one of the fastest-growing beverage trademarks in the United States. In Australia, we purchased Organic & Raw Trading Company, which gives us MOJO, our first company-owned kombucha brand. And we invested in the Made Group, which is known for products like cold-pressed juice and high-protein smoothies. In Europe, we purchased Tropico, which gives our French business a strong foothold in the still fruit-flavored beverages. We believe these brands that have strong edge will eventually allow us to gain quality leadership in the respective categories. And, of course, our biggest announcement in the quarter was our pending acquisition of Costa. What we get with Costa is more than just a brand. It's a platform that will give us the ability to scale within the $500 billion global hot beverage category. Despite the size of Costa, our approach will be similar to the other deals, like innocent and Honest. We'll aim to preserve Costa's unique capabilities, while adding the strength of the Coca-Cola system. As with all our M&A, completing the acquisition is only the first step. What is critical is accelerating our results and executing with precision. To ensure we properly connect and globally scale key acquisitions, investments and partnerships, we have created a new group, Global Ventures, to be led by Jennifer Mann. In this newly-created position, Jennifer and her team will focus on ensuring we get the maximum value from acquisition and investments like Costa, our partnership with Monster Beverages, et cetera. This group will also partner with colleagues around the world to identify and nurture the next series of fast-growing opportunities. As you'll recall, this was just one of the organizational changes we announced in mid-October. Now, more than ever, we must constantly adapt our business to the changing marketplace. The leadership changes we're making over the coming months are significant, and I believe that they will set us up for success in the years to come. Beginning January 1, Brian Smith will become our President and Chief Operating Officer. In this role, Brian will bring an accelerated focus on the execution of our initiatives in the field, while I'll focus on the overall success of the company, as well as our long-term strategic direction. Brian is a valued business partner with tremendous experience, most recently as Group President for Europe, Middle East & Africa. At a time when our business is fast-changing and more complex than ever, it's important to have a skilled executive who can focus intently on the success of our field operations. I can't think of a better fit than Brian. We've also announced a succession plan for our Chief Financial Officer. Kathy, who's had a tremendous 32-year career at the company, will retire as CFO in March of next year. She'll be succeeded as CFO by John Murphy, who will begin the transition to his new job by serving as Deputy CFO starting January 1. John currently leads our Asia Pacific group and is a great choice for the vital work of overseeing our Finance organization. John's extensive experience includes financial, strategy and operational roles, so he's a natural fit to step in. And, finally, we elected Nancy Quan as Chief Technical Officer. Nancy will join my leadership team to focus on product supply, strategic sourcing and technical governance as we evolve as a total beverage company. These changes led to a number of others that we also announced. And I'm pleased that our deep bench allows us to move a group of diverse, talented and experienced leaders into new roles quickly. So, in summary, the global economy is still growing, but remains volatile. Some markets are getting better, while others are struggling as the economic cycle moves to a different phase. Our industry is growing, driven by both developed and emerging markets. And we are winning with momentum in our business. So, despite currency moving against us, we remain focused on delivering the earnings guidance we laid out at the beginning of the year. Finally, I'd like to thank Kathy. While Kathy will be with us through next March, I would be remiss not to take a moment to thank her and acknowledge her outstanding career. Over her 32 years here at the company, Kathy has made significant contributions to both our company and the system, working her way from Financial Analyst all the way to the most senior Finance role in the company, truly, a testament to the value she has brought through every phase of her journey. And as CFO for the past five years, she executed the company's financials through the extremely complex refranchising process and she is leaving a strong foundation for John to build on. And, finally, she has been a critical partner to me and I have appreciated all her valuable support. Thank you, Kathy.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. It has been a tremendous honor to serve as the Chief Financial Officer of The Coca-Cola Company. During my tenure with the company, I have seen our business evolve and grow from a sparkling beverage company with three principal brands to a total beverage company with numerous billion-dollar brands that span across all beverage categories. It has also been a pleasure working for first Muhtar and now James. I'm excited for the future of the company. We have a great leadership team that will continue to build on and execute the company's strategy. And I'm particularly excited about the incoming CFO, John Murphy. John's experience and capabilities will allow him to be a great partner to James and a great leader for the Finance organization. So, I'm looking forward to working with my team as we close out the rest of 2018, and I look forward to working with John to ensure a smooth transition as he takes over in 2019. Now, turning to our performance in the quarter, as James mentioned, we saw strong underlying growth, building on a solid first half. We delivered 6% organic revenue growth, driven by 4% concentrate shipments and 2% price/mix. Concentrate shipments outpaced unit case volume growth by 2 points in the quarter. This was due largely to Brazilian bottlers building inventory as a precaution to any further supply disruptions in the country around the presidential elections and ahead of changes in local tax regulation. We anticipate this inventory build will reverse in the fourth quarter, as the elections are now completed and the tax regulation has been phased-in. So strong organic revenue growth, combined with ongoing productivity measures and the timing of expenses, drove 20% underlying operating income growth in the quarter. While the underlying results are strong, as you know, our reported financials continue to be affected by accounting changes enacted at the beginning of this year, and from cycling bottler refranchising activity from last year. Our comparable operating margin increased 575 basis points due to refranchising and strong underlying performance, partially offset by an approximate 130 basis point impact from new accounting standards and currency. Productivity helped drive a roughly 400 basis point expansion in underlying operating margins, with actions across all of our operating segments. However, we saw a particular benefit in our North America and Corporate segment due to Lean enterprise initiatives. The accounting impact from the change in revenue recognition was roughly in line with our expectations. It's important to note that the impact varied significantly by operating segment. For example, Latin America saw over a 400 basis points benefit in its margins, while North America's margin was impacted by roughly 250 basis points. So I recognize that there are a lot of moving parts, but if you were to neutralize each of these effects, our underlying operating margins expanded about 400 basis points in the quarter and about 200 basis points for the year-to-date period. Below the line, we benefited from a lower tax rate. In order to bring our year-to-date effective tax rate in line with our revised full year expectation of 20.3%, we recorded an effective tax rate of 19% in the quarter. So all-in, good operational performance, coupled with a timing benefit and a lower effective tax rate, resulted in comparable EPS of $0.58 in the quarter, up 14%, which includes an 8% unfavorable impact from currency. So before turning to the fourth quarter, let me provide an update on bottler transactions. I am happy to announce that with the sale of our company-owned bottler in Canada at the end of the third quarter, we have now completed our North America bottler refranchising process. We've set ourselves up for the future with an energized bottling system that is bringing a renewed focus on their local markets. In Asia, we expect to acquire 51% of our Philippines bottler from Coca-Cola FEMSA during the fourth quarter. This will become part of our Bottling Investments Group, which is now comprised primarily of Southwest and Southeast Asian bottlers. These two transactions should roughly offset each other, resulting in a minimal structural impact in our P&L in 2019. In Africa, we are moving forward with the sales process for our company-owned bottler, but we now expect to sell an equity stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa in 2019 rather than in the fourth quarter of 2018. Now turning to the remainder of this year, considering our performance year-to-date and despite an increasingly challenging currency environment, we are maintaining our guidance on organic revenue and comparable EPS growth. Specifically, we continue to expect organic revenue growth of at least 4% and comparable EPS growth of 8% to 10%. However, there are two elements within that guidance that are changing and then there's a third element that impacts phasing. While these balance each other for the full year, due to the timing of each, they do result in a shift between quarters. So first, we expect the third quarter inventory buildup in our Brazilian bottlers to reverse in the fourth quarter. Second, we now expect to sell CCBA, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, in 2019 instead of in 2018. As such, a $0.02 structural benefit that we expected to receive from this transaction will now shift from the fourth quarter 2018 into our 2019 earnings. Third, we now expect an effective tax rate of 20.3% for the full year versus our original estimate of 21%. Now while this will be a slight benefit to our fourth quarter earnings, it was a much larger benefit to our third quarter earnings. And this was because we needed to bring our year-to-date effective tax rate in line with our revised full year expectation. So as such, we recorded an effective tax rate of 19% in the third quarter. Now, taken together, these three changes represent a $0.03 unfavorable impact to fourth quarter earnings, while the full year does not change. As always, our Investor Relations team will be happy to walk through each element in more detail as you build out your models for the year. Turning to cash flow, we continue to expect to generate cash from operations of approximately $8 billion. And we remain disciplined in our capital allocation. We continue to expect to reinvest $1.7 billion in the business through capital expenditures. And we will return free cash flow to shareowners through dividends of approximately $6.7 billion and an expected $1 billion in net share repurchase. So in summary, we delivered solid financial performance in both the quarter and year-to-date periods, and we remain focused on delivering full year comparable EPS within our previously-provided range of 8% to 10%. So, Operator, we're now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, good morning, everybody.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning, Bryan.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And, Kathy I want to wish you all the best. Thank you for all your help over the years.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thank you.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So I guess my question is related to CCBA. And I think in the press release, there's a write-down that's been described there. And so, I guess my question is a couple of things. One, what's driving the write-down in CCBA? And how should we think about maybe how you're thinking about structuring a deal going forward? Is that just lower the price? Or you're thinking about different types of ownership structures? Just any update there would be helpful.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah, want me to start? So, yeah, so the actual write-down was a function of the impairment indicators. So for accounting purposes, we have to look at all of our investments. And we do that at a certain time of year. And based upon the indicators, what happened with the macro environment, and particularly the currency devaluation in South Africa, drove us to have an impairment that we had to write down, basically. And it's not a function of trying to change the price to sell in the future. It's merely an accounting impairment.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah, and I'm not sure that that radically changes how we're thinking about structuring the deal. We've got a number of conversations ongoing with different parties about how we might create a stronger system in South and East Africa. If you invest in the emerging markets, you don't always expect a straight line. And that's kind of what's come through in the impairment driven by the macros, and as we've adapted to the sugar tax in the second quarter. But our view of the long-term attractiveness of Africa, or the youngest billion, remains undimmed. And we think it's a very exciting asset. And so we're working with different parties on potential setups.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nStephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, everyone, good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Steve.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning.\nStephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Congrats, Kathy, on a great career from me as well.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thank you.\nStephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, James, I, too, was hoping to maybe step away from the quarter a moment and just ask a question on how new initiatives are being prioritized across the system under the total beverages company strategy. And specifically, how you've been able to streamline potential points of friction between yourselves and your bottling partners. Over the years, I guess, it seems to me, at least, like there have been many good intentions, but oftentimes, the systems may have been bogged down in debating who should spend what portion of new initiative costs; conversely, who should reap more of the benefits. Just everyone seems to have a different definition of what equitable means. But today, just by virtue of how fast the system is bringing new ideas to market, both organically and now, as you highlighted, through M&A, it seems like you've been able to maybe cut through some of that red tape and focus more on the end consumer. So again, maybe just talk a little bit more, if you could, about the changes that have been made. Maybe how the new Global Ventures group may fit in going forward. And then, ultimately, how should investors, in fact, think about what portion of the costs versus what portion of the benefits accrues to KO versus the bottling partners? Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Well, that is indeed a broad question. I think, firstly, it would be fair to recognize that the system is benefiting from the experiments and the things we've been doing over the last 10-plus years around the world to try and expand into a number of other categories. So we've been experimenting and learning and identifying what's good practice and what's not so good practice for a good number of years now. And you're seeing that base of knowledge and expertise growing, that's allowing us to have a foundation to move faster. Clearly, the end of the refranchising process and having a kind of a clear partnership network with well-funded partners who want to invest and want to win in the marketplace, combined with a greater degree of organizational clarity and focus on empowerment and accountability and getting things done on the company side, whether that be the marketing, the innovation, the M&A, whichever piece of the puzzle is required, has clearly helped. And then, I think the Global Ventures is another step in that direction. We've had acquisitions in parts of the world. We've had venturing emerging brands units in different parts of the world. What we've not been so successful at is tying that together across regions, across the groups, if you like, and I think that's what this represents in terms of the Global Ventures. So rather than letting something be successful in one group and it taking forever to get to another group, this unit here will be there to help push and drive the agenda for greater speed going forward. At the end of the day, how do we get faster? We get faster not just because of all those things, but because there are exciting, interesting, financially-attractive opportunities that the system can capture. The relative economics and the capital needed differ by category. They differ depending on the starting point of the different systems in the different part of the world, what's already been built. And, of course, what we've learned over the years with our partners is how to move quickly to a place where it's attractive for everyone. At the end of the day, if it's not attractive for everyone, it's not going to go very far, and that's us, our bottling partners and, ultimately, the customers and down to the end consumer. So, it just needs to be organized, so the incentives are clear and attractive.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And congrats, Kathy.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thanks.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, I wanted to focus on emerging markets. There's obviously been a lot of market concern over the slowing macros in China. There's been the election volatility down in Latin America. You mentioned a number of emerging markets, some of which are looking more positive. Some of which aren't looking as positive. So, I guess, James, can you just give us a bit of an update on your perspective on the macro outlook here in emerging markets as you look around the world; not so much a review of the quarter, but sort of what you saw sequentially as you moved through the quarter in October, and any forward-looking thoughts? And while we're on that subject, obviously, a stronger dollar sort of reflects those emerging markets concerns. So, any thoughts on sort of the FX pressure for 2019 earnings based on where we stand today would also be helpful. Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah. Kind of in reverse order; it's a little early to provide FX guidance for 2019. But I think that, look, when you stand back, clearly, there are some emerging markets that got better. If we'd been talking two, three years ago, we were having a tougher time in China, Brazil, recently India. But those have all improved over the last 6 to 12 months. And we have good growth in all of them, including Brazil. But in the meantime, it's got tougher in a number, whether that's Argentina, Turkey, South Africa and the Middle East. So I think there's clearly some additional volatility in the emerging markets. I think you can see that in the GDP numbers. You can see that in the GDP forecasts. At least the IMF and some of the others are coming and going, oh, okay, it's getting a little softer. And I think that's representative of the U.S. dollar's strength in recent months. Exactly what the path forward would be is hard to predict exactly at this point in time. We're clearly moving to a slightly different phase in the economic recovery, and I think that will bring some ups and downs. But net-net, we've got a portfolio across 200-plus countries. We're seeing growth in the developed, in the developing, in the sum of the emerging. And at the end of the day, we could do a lot of crystal ball gazing, but what's really important is we focus on what we can do, on what we can control, which is about staying close to the consumer, understanding what drinks and packages they want, working with our customers to work out how to create value for them, provide the right marketing and the right innovations, so the system can execute with excellence, and that will deliver us a winning formula in good days and in bad days.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.\nVivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning, Vivien.\nVivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: So last month, there was public commentary that you guys are closely monitoring the non-psychoactive CBD category. So, James, I was hoping that you could expand on that comment and discuss what, if any, regulatory changes you would need to see to become more interested in the space in the U.S. and also internationally? Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Well, I think that's a simple one. We don't have any plans at this stage to get into this space. So that's kind of where we are.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Bonnie, your line is now open.\nBonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning, Bonnie.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning.\nBonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Congratulations, Kathy. I, too, wish you all the best.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thank you.\nBonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I have a question for you guys on your marketing spend in the quarter and so far this year. In general, I'm wondering if you're seeing the lift you expected from your spending. And then, could you give us a sense of how much your spending has increased this year or not, and how we should think about that evolving in the future? I guess I'm assuming as a percentage of sales, it would likely increase, given your lower revenue base, but on an absolute dollar basis, how should we think about this going forward? Will you plan to increase spend in the future? Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah. I think, clearly, there are some mechanical parts to the P&L as we sell some of the bottling and refranchising has come to a close. But we have been pursuing a steadfast strategy of reinvesting in our business for a number of years. And so I think there's no big discontinuity happening or seen out there at this stage. So I think the marketing spend, I think is producing good results. We are winning in the marketplace. We're growing the soft drink category in revenue and volume. The Coke Trademark's growing. Coke Zero Sugar's growing. We're seeing the sales and volume and transaction uplifts, engagements by the consumers with the brands, so we think we're in a good place in terms of what are marketing is delivering for us. So leaving aside the mechanical effects of refranchising to the P&L and the percentage of DME, then I think it's relatively steady as we go. So yeah, I think you can see those examples.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nLauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about competitive dynamics in North America. Latest Nielsen came out today and shows that Pepsi still does not appear to have moved on pricing. So if you could just talk a little bit about what you're seeing actually in the marketplace, because I know Nielsen is not always the most representative. Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah. So clearly, we've taken some price increases this year in the U.S. marketplace, whether that be in the juice category by changes in the packaging, in soft drinks, in the number of channels. And, clearly, we've been pushing that through over the years under the headline of we're doing a lot of things to engage the consumer with the various categories in our portfolio from the marketing and the packaging, working with our customers to create value for them. We think this is a strategy that has worked for us over the recent years and will continue and is continuing to work for us going forward. So, I'm not sure it makes that much sense for me to comment on short periods of competitive pricing activity. We've always said, look, we're going to follow a rational pricing approach with a few points of pricing, which is what's happening on an underlying basis. In the U.S., it won't necessarily be a straight line for all sorts of reasons, but we're going to stick to our strategy. And I think that's the one that will see us through to the right place.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning and best wishes to you, Kathy, from me as well.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thank you.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So, I guess my question is just on the guidance. So, one is just clarification, so for this year, if we think about all the moving parts, on the comparable EPS, really the only thing that's changing is the tax rate coming down, which is about $0.02 or $0.03 benefit to your guidance. And then, I know you're not giving 2019 guidance, but as we think about, James, your sort of commitment to continue to grow comparable EPS even with some of the FX headwinds, you've got tax rate benefit going away next year, FX probably another 2 or 3 points headwind. So maybe conceptually, what are some of the P&L levers that you can continue to focus on to really drive growth and comparable EPS? Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Do you want to start with it?\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Certainly. So, yes, there's the tax benefit for this year. And given that the structural is slightly worse than we said at the beginning of the year, and then, frankly, currency is worse than we said at the beginning of the year. We are going to stick to our 8% to 10% guidance.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah. And 2019, it's too early to get into 2019. But in the end, we said we're going to follow three pillars in trying to manage the business going forward. We need to grow the top line by doing the right things for the consumer in terms of the beverages, the marketing, the packaging, the innovation. Create value with our customers, have the right refranchised bottlers to execute in the marketplace. That will drive local top line in each of the 200-plus countries we operate in. We'll focus ourselves and as a system on being efficient stewards of the P&L and the capital, such that the margins, again, locally, will be appropriate for that business and for driving growth. And then, of course, the piece that we have to bring together as the portfolio management is paying attention to what that translates to in comparable EPS earnings. How are we going to put that puzzle together for 2019, we'll come back to in a future date.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Congrats as well from me.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thanks.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So, you're delivering pretty well on fanning out the portfolio to effectively to meet consumers' needs, including with M&A. Could you talk more about the pace of activity from you and I guess the size of activity we actually should extrapolate then for the company going forward? And also, how specifically has management incentive expectations and structure kind of changed all the way throughout the organization to really make sure that these investments work and allow these brands to come in and be successful within your relatively complex ecosystem, without this, what we often see and I think what you guys have suffered for in the past, some sort of organ-rejection issues. And then also from a strategic perspective, you've stuck to nonalcoholic ready-to-drink so far. What are your views about alcoholic right now? Clearly, there are some experimentations where your CFO is leaving \u2013 or your new CFO will be leaving from, but are you open to that world as well in the short term? Thanks a lot.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thanks, Ali. Look, I think the pace of M&A, clearly, the third quarter was a more active quarter than normal. When we look at M&A opportunities, it's obviously a function of, are we seeing things that work for us in terms of a role for that in our business, whether it be a role in the portfolio, a role in the capabilities, providing us with a new entry into something? So clearly, we've got to be focused on what does it do for us. Then, of course, there's a question of price and a question of availability of the things that we want. So I'm not sure that extrapolation does make sense. And I think that's just something we'll have to cover as we go forward. We've made a number of statements as how we want to see the total company structured in terms of growth, in terms of leverage, in terms of returns to the shareholders. So I think it's the management of the business that will need to go forward, but we've got some guardrails on how we think about the total. And then, as we bought in some of these companies a little, as I talked on one of the earlier questions, we've learned over the last number of years on how to bring them in and what's the best way and what are the models that best work for different categories in different situations. And that's allowed us both to do better as we bring them in, in the place that we're buying them, whichever part of the world that is, but also then do better in lifting and shifting and scaling them to other parts of the world. We're not as good at that as we would like to be or are perhaps as fast as we would like to be, better said, which is why we're bringing the Global Ventures organizational unit into being, to just give an extra twist to accelerating that piece of the strategy of lifting, shifting and scaling. And we'll learn more. And we'll learn more. And that's, of course, tied back to the incentives. We have general incentives to the broad population against revenue and profits and cash flow, which obviously link back to the M&A strategy. And then, for those teams specifically doing M&As, we have deal-specific incentives.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open.\nWilliam B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning, Bill.\nTimothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning, Bill.\nWilliam B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And congratulations, Kathy.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thank you.\nWilliam B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Actually, James, wanted to talk a little bit about the management transition. Just a few things. One, why now? I mean, I guess, Muhtar, for a while, didn't have a COO. And so it seems an interesting time to add that. And two, looking at all the hires and all the kind of leads, they all seem to date back to your time in working in Latin America. And so is this kind of a getting a band back together? And with that, are you trying to replicate something or expand something that happened in Latin America to across the company?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: So I think, the management changes, why now is, I think it's a simple function of we've ended a phase. We had some initial reinvestment going back in brand KO. We set out the refranchising. We've brought that to a conclusion. We built on our foundations of the last number of years in setting out Beverages for Life with a clear vision for where we want to go. We've added flesh and bone to that vision over the last 12, 18 months. And what's clear is we've got a lot of things to do. And so that's why I think bringing Brian in as COO will allow us to be able to execute against the leadership agenda with speed. Of course, we could just go slower with less people, but we need to be able to execute at speed and be able in a world that's volatile. And we're in a lot of places, we need to be able to lead the enterprise forward. And I think Brian just brings that extra capacity with a focus on the field operations that allows me to look across the whole company, and we'll be able to work as a double act to bring a lot of that going forward. And so I think that's why it's the right time to bring Brian on. On are we putting a band back together, I wish I was good at music. I'd love to be in a band, but there was zero chance of that happening. So here I am. I think what you're seeing is executives being promoted across a broad section of the global talent pool. Yes, Brian spent some time in Latin America, as did John. Brian's also been in Europe. He's been in the U.S. John's been in Asia. So what I think you're seeing is people who've worked around the world coming up through the organization taking on strong roles. Nancy, who hasn't worked in Latin America, worked in Corporate, worked in North America, she's come up. You've seen the new Group Presidents, like Nikos [Koumettis], come up through the European business, worked in Canada as well. Manolo [Arroyo], who's gone to Asia, spent most of his time between Europe and Asia. You see Jennifer Mann, who has come up through the U.S. I think you're seeing a lot of people come up through the U.S. organization, come up through the organization and take different jobs, and the new business unit presidents, you know Galya [Molinas] has gone from Turkey to Mexico via the U.S. So you're seeing a lot of movement. And I think it's testament to the talent pipeline around the world and our ability to have people grow by giving them different experiences in different parts of the world and different types and business situations that makes them stronger leaders, that then allows us to deploy them to the best use and the greatest opportunity for the company.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie. Your line is now open.\nCaroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Kathy, we will miss you. Good luck in the future.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thank you.\nCaroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: And my question is around impact cost pressures. I'm assuming they are largely in North America, and just trying to understand what your hedges look like, how much you've been affected so far by transport costs, PET, aluminum and what you're seeing in the fourth quarter, what you're expecting.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: You want me to take that?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Please.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: So on commodities, pressure on input costs, yes, we are seeing that primarily in North America, given the structure of the businesses there, the foodservice business as well as our Minute Maid business and in our BIG segment, is where we will primarily see that pressure from commodities. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate it to be much in line with like we have seen year-to-date, with freight pressure continuing for North America into the fourth quarter. Basically, we have hedges on our primary input costs, input commodities, but I don't anticipate the fourth quarter to be significantly different from what we've seen year-to-date.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge. Your line is now open.\nBrett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC: Congratulations to you, Kathy, as well.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thank you.\nBrett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC: Question on business performance or cluster performance, right, if we look at that year-to-date or in the third quarter, the numbers don't necessarily bear out the diversification of your business. I know there's been efforts to rationalize SKUs and so forth and so on. There's pricing and mix impact, so I don't know the best way to go through it, but can you talk about how you see the business progressing year-to-date or over a longer period of time in terms of diversification that may not bear out the numbers that you report within the release? Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. Yeah, look, we grew. I'm just going to go through the clusters to make it easy. Sparkling did really well this quarter year-to-date. We saw strong growth around the world in all the groups. In Trademark Coke, in Diet Coke in the U.S., and actually Coke Zero Sugar had its best quarter of growth in 10 years. So clearly, a lot of what we're doing in sparkling is working, is engaging with consumers. And that's very pleasing. As we go into the other categories, what we see in water is a change to the recent trend. So in the last number of quarters, we were actually declining or doing worse in water. And this time, we've done better because we're kind of moving out of the phase of deprioritize something in the low value water, and starting to see some of the benefits of our focus on the premium waters, whether that's China, some of the innovations in Mexico around CL, (48:35) or even North America with smartwater and with Topo Chico. So, I think you're starting to see growth coming back into water as we've done a bit of deprioritizing and moved more into premium and innovation. In the case of juice, the juice category, that is down this quarter. A lot of that is driven by a couple of pieces. One, we've talked about before, which is the North American resizing of the juice; and secondly, the macroeconomics in the Middle East, in particular, have hit our Aujan juice business quite hard. So, there's a clear macroeconomic impact. So, what we're doing as, in fact, we've done across each of the categories is focus on if there is bits of the business that need to be deprioritized or rightsized or reshaped, so that we are going to drive revenue growth in an attractive business, we need to get that done, so I think you're seeing some of that adjustment still going on in the juice business. Where there is a stronger foundation with the right structures for the business and attractive consumer propositions, you saw good growth. So, in Mexico, Western Europe, India, Brazil, we saw strong performance in the juice, dairy and plant cluster. So, it's about us still focusing on getting some bits right. And, lastly, tea and coffee; coffee was up in the quarter, driven by growth in Japan. Coffee, at least for now, is largely a Japanese story. And we had not done as well as we had wanted recently. We've not kept up with the innovation. We brought more innovation to the table that allowed us to do better in the third quarter. Clearly, the natural disasters and the destruction of the plant is going to be a problem, but we think we're back on the right track. And then, tea, actually we've done really well in tea with the completion of the globalization of Fuze, but we have decided to sell less of the non-ready-to-drink tea. That was a focus in Turkey. So, what you're seeing is growth in underlying businesses across all the categories, building better positions from which to go forward on. And, of course, there is some netting with things that we are deprioritizing or where macros are impacting us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nKevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations, Kathy.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thank you.\nKevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: James, I wanted to drill down a bit on the sports drink strategy now for KO, following the announcement of the BODYARMOR relationship. So, specifically, maybe talk a little bit about positioning of the brand versus Powerade, any potential friction you see there, balancing investment at the BODYARMOR level versus what maybe incurred at KO or by bottlers' growth opportunities for the brand as you see it outside the U.S. And then, lastly, with respect to the path to ownership, because limited detail has been provided, anything you can share there, even sort of a rough timeline would be helpful. Thank you.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah. No. So, what we've announced in terms of any future stages of timeline are not there yet. But I think the first important point is to recognize this is a minority investment for us and it's going to be run as a separate business. So, the BODYARMOR team are going to make the decisions about how to grow the brand, what innovations and formulas and packages to bring to the marketplace. We have a clear agreement on how they will go through the Coke bottling system, and that will take place. And the Powerade team will continue to focus on Powerade. I think it's fair to say the two sit in quite different positions today. BODYARMOR is clearly coming from a more premium space with a different consumer proposition in terms of the ingredients and the setup of the drink. So, I think there's space for both. And we expect to be able to go forward, but I think it is worth noting that they are going to be run as two parallel and separate businesses at this stage. And ditto, that goes for any expansion outside the U.S. That's a decision that BODYARMOR needs to make.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nAmit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning\nTimothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning, Amit.\nAmit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): James, you talked about the coffee category is $500 billion. Can you just flesh that out for us a little bit in the context of the Costa acquisition? I mean, understanding that potentially, you're not going into the retail side of the business, where else do you see opportunities? Is it RTD? Is it single-serve? And if it includes single-serve, like, where is Costa today from either a percent of sales or partnership basis?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. Look, I think there's a number of exciting things that can be done as Costa becomes part of our global coffee platform and our ability to grow in coffee. Obviously, ready-to-drink is an opportunity that makes a lot of sense for us to focus on. I think the other pieces where we can for sure grow our coffee business is in being a better beverage partner to the many customers out there in the many different channels, whether that be through the use of a bean to machines relationship within their facilities, or the use of the Costa vending machines, which is a bit like our Freestyle machines on the Coke side. There are a lot of ways to work with immediate consumption customers to bring a coffee offering from The Coca-Cola Company, whether in the brand, and the drink and the machinery. And, of course, then there's the at-home market, whether that be pods, capsules, loose beans, there is a substantive opportunity to grow that space as well.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.\nLaurent Grandet - Guggenheim Partners: Hi, everyone, and, Kathy, I wish you all the best for the future. It has been a pleasure working with you.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thank you, Laurent.\nLaurent Grandet - Guggenheim Partners: So like to focus on pricing, could you please help us better understand the price/mix increase in the quarter, whether that's coming from price increase, promotional activity or packaging or category mix. And also you had an off cycle price increase early in the summer to cope with some commodities increase. Are you planning still to increase price early next year? And what will be the magnitude of it? Thank you.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: I presume you're talking just about North America rather than globally. And, obviously, we're not going to provide a guidance or indications on what we're going to do next year on pricing. I think when you look at the North America pricing, of course, you look at it and then perhaps it's easier just to look at the year-to-date. You see that we're down a point in terms of price/mix in North America year-to-date. And then, obviously, we've been taking pricing in the marketplace. And it generated the question last quarter, and whilst it's moved in the right direction this quarter, it's still the same sort of gap. What's happening is, firstly, we had the conversation about the freight costs, which are a deduction to revenue in the way that we're looking about this. That's a point across the year-to-date. Depending on the quarter, there's been some timing of promotional items. The last quarter, it was a headwind. This quarter, it was a positive. On year-to-date, it's all in balance. So let's just ignore that for a second. Otherwise, it gets very confusing looking at the minutia of each quarter. The big picture is it's been down one on freight. Timing and promotions is a intra-quarter issue. And then, the biggest gap between what we report as pricing and what you see in the marketplace and what the bottlers report, is the business mix of the different business models in our North American business. Unlike the rest of the globe, the U.S. has a big portion where we have finished products, so Minute Maid, juice, the fountain business, but we also sell a lot of concentrate on sparkling to the bottlers. And, therefore, you can end up with a curious mathematical situation, where you take price increases, and prices are going up in each of those three business systems, and yet the average is going down because of the different average prices per gallon of the different business models. And the reality is because of the rightsizing we did on juice, that which is a higher revenue per gallon business, it produces this curious mathematical effect, which is why I keep underlying that what's going on underneath is we have been taking price, given the input costs and given what's going on in the U.S. marketplace, and to support the reinvestment in the business, and that strategy remains true. And it's helped us win in the marketplace.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Okay. I think we're at the end of the questions. So thank you very much, everyone. To conclude, we had a solid quarter. We're on track to close out the year per our guidance. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us today. Thank you.

Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.\nTimothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Waller, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report. We posted schedules under the Financial Reports & Information tab in the Investors section of our company website. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to from time-to-time by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles.

If you have more than one question, please ask your most pressing first and then return and reenter the queue. Now, let me turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying and underlining that we're winning in a dynamic and vibrant industry. The global beverage industry is growing faster than last year, driven by better results in the emerging and developing markets and also the sparkling soft drink category. We're gaining value share as we execute on the strategies we laid out for you in early 2017. And importantly, our operating performance is accelerating as a result. So 2018, at the halfway mark of the year, we're seeing good momentum in our underlying business. Organic revenue is up 5% year-to-date, driven by a good mixture of volume and price/mix. Global volume is up 3%, which is the strongest we've seen in five years. And comparable EPS is up 5% year-to-date, despite stronger currency headwinds than we anticipated at the beginning of 2018. And, as we noted at the start of the year, we've always expected EPS growth to be back half-weighted and that has not changed. So operationally, looking around the world, we delivered strong top line growth in the first half of the year, driven by continued strength in our international markets. In Asia-Pacific, strong performance in key emerging markets like China, India, and Vietnam drove mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for this segment during the first half of the year. And while we continue to expand our total beverage portfolio across all of our Asian markets, our sparkling soft drink portfolio led our top line acceleration. Turning to Latin America, even in the face of headwinds, we delivered high single-digit organic revenue growth for the first half as we focus on the fundamentals. Mexico continues to perform well, driven by solid growth across our sparkling and dairy portfolios. In Brazil, a 10-day transport strike in late May put a virtual halt to the economy. Prior to that, we were on track to deliver the third quarter of sequentially improving volume growth. Our system worked hard to recover momentum. And by the end of the quarter, we had bounced back to pre-strike growth rates. In EMEA, we grew organic revenue 7% year to date through balanced volume and price/mix. We see solid momentum in the emerging and developing markets, with notable strength in Central Europe and Turkey. And in the developed markets, we continue to expand our total beverage portfolio through additions like Fuze Tea, Honest Coffee, and AdeZ plant-based beverages across Europe. In North America, we're delivering strong performance in the marketplace year to date. According to Nielsen, our U.S. retail sales are up 3% in the second quarter, driven by both volume and pricing. We are pleased with the performance of our innovation and brand-building initiatives. Our no-sugar sparkling soft drink portfolio delivered 7% retail value growth in the quarter, thanks to the recently restaged Diet Coke and strong growth of Coke Zero Sugar. Our hydration and coffee portfolios drove strong results as well. POWERADE ZERO, DASANI Sparkling, and our coffee portfolio each grew volume double digits. These efforts combined with the improving execution from our bottling partners have enabled our system to continue capturing strong value share gains. Now, let me turn to the pricing environment in North America. Stepping back, the overall market remains disciplined, and we remain focused on executing revenue growth management initiatives to grow our price/mix over time. However, as you can see, reported price/mix in North America continued to differ from market-level performance. This was principally due to three factors. First, freight costs remain a challenge, were slightly worse than our initial forecast. And as we noted in the first quarter call, outbound freight costs are reported in price/mix for 2018. Secondly, the timing of deductions, which net out in the year, between the second quarter and the third quarter put a point of pressure on price/mix. Lastly, business mix put two points of pressure on reported price/mix, as our concentrates sparkling business grew faster than our finished goods business, particularly the juice and tea. Combined, these factors put approximately four points of pressure on the reported price/mix, driving the vast majority of the difference you see versus the growth in scanner data. We're taking pricing actions alongside our bottlers on our sparkling beverage brands and expect to see positive price/mix in the second half across the portfolio in aggregate, as our package downsizing and our marketplace pricing actions are fully implemented and the timing items reverse. These factors, along with the continued execution of our strategy, will result in stronger financial performance in North America in the back half. So to summarize, our emerging and developing markets are accelerating, with double-digit organic revenue growth year to date. And our developed markets are performing well, delivering low single-digit organic revenue growth. Now, turning and talking a little bit about how we're driving disciplined sustainable growth in the business, obviously, first, it requires a solid understanding of the consumer to build the right portfolio in each market. Over the last few calls, we've discussed how we're expanding our portfolio through innovations, acquisitions, and lifting, shifting, and sustaining successful brands across markets. But disciplined growth also requires that our existing brands retain and sharpen their edge by connecting better with consumers' needs. We're working diligently to increase our capabilities in this area because satisfying key consumption occasions allows us to attract new drinkers and ultimately achieve quality leadership. One example of this is Georgia Coffee in Japan. Georgia has historically had a strong male consumer base in Japan. So we recently launched a new variant called Craftsman with recipes, flavors, and packaging designed to appeal more to the new consumer segments, in particular younger adults and women. Craftsman's drinks come in premium, glass-like PET bottles that are resealable, making them portable and easier to consume. This is a change from the traditional cans, opening up new consumption occasions that were previously untapped. We're off to a good start, with our coffee portfolio in Japan reversing recent trends and growing volume mid-single digits. This kind of discipline of taking a very tailored approach to consumption occasions and channels is also one of the ways we're attracting new sparkling drinkers. For our flagship brand Coca-Cola, we're leveraging the brand's edge, which is centered around uplift and energize, to build consumption rituals through consumers with strategic innovation. An example, Coca-Cola with coffee, this product started as a trial in Australia. Other markets are now introducing it, but with twists based on the learning. In Vietnam, for example, the brewed coffee category is very large, so we introduced Coke Plus Coffee there with great coffee cues like aroma, with less sugar, positioning it as an alternative pick-me-up for the traditional coffee drinker. Execution was targeted and deliberate, focusing on specific occasions and channels, like the mid-afternoon pick-me-up, in coffee shops and at work. And the early results are very promising, delivering incremental growth for the Coca-Cola brand with very little cannibalization. While this is just one specific example, it is indicative of the broader strategic approach we are taking to reinvigorate the sparking category. It's about leveraging brand edge and innovation to build consumption rituals by offering people what they want, when and where they want it. Actions like this around the world have helped us accelerate the performance of Coke trademark, with global volume up 2% year-to-date. Of course, driving disciplined growth is not just about expanding our beverage portfolio. It's about shaping quality leadership for sustainable revenue profit and cash flow growth. Therefore, it is critical that we reduce complexity to ensure our system sales force is focused, our supply chain is efficient and our innovation pipeline gains more space and visibility at the point of sale. To that end, we've been identifying and killing zombie brands and SKUs while focusing our teams on the work that matters most. Many of you have asked what we mean by zombie brands and where the opportunities are. So let me try and give a few examples. Earlier this year, our Middle East and North Africa business unit identified more than 125 underperforming SKUs to eliminate. To-date, we've discontinued 60% of those and intend to delist the rest by the end of the year, allowing us to reallocate resources to brands and strategic initiatives that are delivering the highest return. Given the benefits we're seeing, of course, we're embedding the elimination of zombie SKUs and brands even further into existing routines, instilling this discipline deeper into our business units. This taking a more disciplined approach to our portfolio is only one of the ways we're looking to reduce complexity in the business. We're also constantly focusing our teams on the work that matters most, driving a productivity mindset in the business with the aim of both funding reinvestment and driving cash flow improvements. For example, after a recent review, we've significantly reduced the number of strategic projects in one of our largest business units to ensure that we are sufficiently allocating resources to the highest return on investment projects, rather than targeting too many actions at once. This is building on the previous productivity actions we've laid out and helping us to drive strong 8% underlying operating income growth for the first half of the year, while continuing to reinvest behind our brands, because ultimately it's not just about growth for the sake of growing. Growth must translate into solid returns for our investors. So taking a step back and looking at the remainder of the year, global economic growth remains robust. Now, of course, there is some level of uncertainty from geopolitical risk and escalating trade conflicts, but our industry remains vibrant and growing. And we are winning and we have momentum in the business. At the same time, the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly since the beginning of the year, increasing our currency headwinds in the back half. So all-in-all, with increasingly currency headwinds partially offset by momentum in the business, we remain focused on delivering the earnings guidance we laid out at the beginning of the year. Let me now turn the call over to Kathy.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thanks and good morning, everyone. As James mentioned, we saw strong underlying growth in the quarter. We delivered 5% organic revenue growth through balanced growth in our volume and price/mix, giving us confidence in our top-line acceleration. The solid organic revenue growth, combined with our ongoing productivity measures, drove 8% underlying operating income growth in the quarter. While the underlying results are strong, as you know, our reported financials continue to be affected by accounting changes enacted at the beginning of this year and from cycling bottler refranchising activity last year. Our comparable operating margin increased more than 300 basis points due to refranchising and strong underlying performance, partially offset by an almost 200 basis point impact of the new accounting standards and currency. Productivity helped to drive the underlying operating margin expansion, with actions across all of our operating segments. However, we saw a particular benefit in our corporate segment due to the Lean Center initiative we began during the second quarter of last year. The accounting impact from the change in revenue recognition was in line with our expectations. It's important to note that the impact varied significantly by operating segment. For example, the impact to operating margins was the most extreme for North America, resulting in over 200 basis points of compression in that segment's margin. Below the line, performance was as we expected, allowing us to deliver comparable EPS growth of $0.61, up 3% in the quarter. So as I turn to the remainder of the year, considering our strong performance in the first half of the year and for reasons James spoke to, we are taking up our guidance on organic revenue and underlying operating income growth. Specifically, we now expect organic revenue growth of at least 4% and underlying operating income growth of at least 9%. At the same time, the expected currency headwinds to full year operating income is now expected to be 4%, an increase of three to four points since the beginning of the year. And, as James mentioned, we remain focused on delivering full year comparable EPS growth within our previously-provided range of 8% to 10%. Turning to cash flow, we now expect to generate cash from operations of approximately $8 billion. This is down from our initial outlook of at least $8.5 billion, largely driven by higher than anticipated tax payment related to an amendment of the prior year's tax return and stronger currency headwinds. And we remain disciplined in our capital allocation. We now expect to reinvest $1.7 billion in the business through capital expenditures. And we will return our free cash flow to shareowners through dividends of approximately $6.7 billion and an expected $1 billion in net share repurchases. Finally, we are on track to pay down approximately $7 billion in gross debt, as previously discussed. So as you model the flow of the year, there are a few items to consider in terms of savings. We expect currency headwinds to negatively impact both net revenue and operating income in the second half of the year. We expect the change in revenue recognition to benefit operating income in the third quarter, which is a reversal of the headwind we recognized in the second quarter. And we expect structural impacts to moderate as we move through the remainder of the year. Finally, we expect our comparable EPS growth to be higher in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter, due to an additional day in the fourth quarter and cycling the impact from last year's natural disaster. As always, our Investor Relations team will be happy to walk through each element in more detail as you build out your models for the year. So in summary, we delivered solid financial performance year-to-date and we remain focused on delivering full year comparable EPS growth within our previously-provided range of 8% to 10%. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nLauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thank you. Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Lauren.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Lauren.\nLauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I was hoping we could talk a little bit about the sports drink category because you called out POWERADE as particularly strong in the U.S. this quarter. We can see in the Nielsen, it's been gaining share. And I remember it being called out, the business in Mexico, in particular, as being called out as a case study at the Analyst Day. So I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about POWERADE's position maybe like in the rest of the markets outside the U.S., the big ones that matter, kind of market share growth trends, relative importance of the category, because it does seem that it perhaps has greater legs maybe than people tend to think. Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. Yeah, I mean, as you say, firstly, we've had a very successful run with POWERADE in Mexico. We told the story about that on the Investor Day and I think it's a great example of where you can bring innovation and long-term patience to going from challenger to leader. Clearly inspired by some of those learnings, we've been looking at that in the U. S. We've done particularly well with POWERADE ZERO as well in the quarter. We made some progress. We got a lot of opportunity ahead of us. It's a very big category in the U.S. I think whilst we're happy that we're going in the right direction, there's much work to be done. And obviously, one of the things that's been helping drive POWERADE in the U.S. and, indeed, globally, in the second quarter was, of course, its link and the activation related to the FIFA World Cup event, where it's one of the brands that's both advertised and present, and so we did a lot of marketing programs on that. So I think part of what you're seeing is the payoff of the marketing programs and the linkage into football. As you look at the rest of the world, POWERADE is charactering (19:33) relatively well. The sports drink category is much bigger in the Americas than it is in the rest of the world. You tend to see more everyday hydration. We have brands like Aquarius, which is big in a number of parts of Europe and does well in Japan. So the rest of the world is not as big in sports drinks as the Americas is. But we had a good quarter. Good execution, good innovation, good link to marketing, but there's a lot more opportunity for us.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nSteve Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thanks. So, there are, obviously, a lot of moving parts in the business with all the structural items, the accounting changes and FX. But the reported gross margin this quarter was just a little light, at least of external projections. So I was wondering if you could just get underneath all the changes and talk about how the underlying gross margin might be trending. It looks to me like maybe they're down modestly year-over-year, which would be consistent with the business mix away from CSDs and towards stills. But then again, sparkling has been kind of trending in line with the total company growth, if not a little bit ahead, year-to-date. So I'm not sure that's the full explanation. So maybe you could just talk about where gross margins have landed year-to-date versus your own internal expectations and how do you expect them to evolve from here? Thank you.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Hi, Steve. So, underlying comparable gross margins expanded about 90 basis points. That really is driven by structural. So 300 basis points is due to structural and then that's offset by some currency and about 200 basis points from the accounting changes, as you said, a lot of moving parts in the quarter. Underlying is under pressure and it's basically it's still moderate pressure, but it's under pressure due to \u2013 we said as we're expanding into other categories and you said yourself as we go into more finished goods businesses, that we were going to have margin pressure. So it is basically within our expectations, because we always said we were going to offset that through our operating margin. So, yes, there is margin compression, but it's very moderate, as we said, as we talked about at Investor Day. And it is within our expectations and we are managing it.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nAli Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. So I had two questions. One is just a follow-up on the previous question on the 300 basis points of comparable operating margin expansion. Can you quantify how much of that was actually productivity in this versus structural change? And then the other question I had, which is not a follow-up, is digging a little bit deeper into North America tea and juice. Clearly, you downsized there metro volumes down, but it didn't really seem to show any price/mix pickup. And maybe downsizing was just commodities and it was a smaller deal, but if you contrast that to when you were chaining the pack architecture in a bigger way or downsizing in sparkling, the price/mix elasticity was much better. You got more transactions, so the volume wasn't down as much. So I want to understand a little bit more the strategy around downsizing. Is it purely commodities, or is there something from a pack architecture in juices and teas? And then also looking forward for that, will that continue to be a drag for the next several quarters in North America? Thanks for those two.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Okay. Let me focus in on the North American tea, juices, et cetera, et cetera, because that of course links to the price/mix. It's probably a slightly longer answer than just tea and juice because it ladders up into the overall price/mix question. And of course, here, there's a temptation to just look at the trees and miss the forest. But I'll try and come from the detail up to the strategic answer. So what's happened in tea and juice, particularly juice, there's clearly some cost pressure. The cost of orange juice inputs, the cost of the packaging we use for our juice business, in particular our chilled juice business, had a lot of cost pressure. So we took, I think, the right strategic decision to try and contain the absolute level of price points in the store by downsizing some of the packages, which we did essentially at the beginning of Q2. What did that cause? It caused us to go down in volume obviously, but we actually got positive pricing in orange juice. If you go to the Nielsen numbers, you can see that pricing in orange juice is up. And so I think what you see is volumes are down, prices are up. Competitors and the retailers, on balance, didn't follow us overnight. They probably followed us closer at the beginning of the third quarter, so that's starting to come through. So we had probably a larger volume impact, which is unfortunate, but traditional for the price leader. And so that's the story in juice. I think the juice thing will start to improve as we get into the back half. We'll do better competitively. And I think the consumer environment will adjust to the new packaging and the new price points. Now, what's interesting as you do modeling is it's really important to remember that in our numbers, we are combining the finished product business of chilled juice with the concentrate business of sparkling. Why is that important? The finished product business has a much higher revenue per unit than the sparkling concentrate business does. So in fact, what is actually happening in North America is we have positive pricing on juice. Our pricing is up, not just the market pricing. Our pricing is up on sparkling as well as the market pricing. Then you're going to ask the question, how can the overall be down. It's because juice is declining, there's a mathematical effect where the weighting of the juice decline counts for more \u2013 the loss of the juice volume counts for more than the fact both are going up. So you can actually have an averaging problem, whereby both categories' pricings are going up, but the average is going down, which is the 2% headwind that we talked about coming from category mix. That will normalize itself out as juice does better into the year. And obviously, it's not really an operating income problem because you're mixing apples and pears with the finished product business and the sparkling business. That's why as you start to look through what's happening in Q2 in North America, it can be distracting to look at all these negatives. But when you layer it up to what's really going on, we're doing the right strategic actions in each category. We're downsizing the juice category. We're focusing on low and no-sugar in the sparkling. We're focusing on smaller pack sizes, all of these allowing us, with the exception of juice in the short term, to get some volume growth, definitely get some transaction growth, getting price/mix in each category. That will layer up over time to generate value for the customers and to realize pricing in the marketplace. And so as these temporary factors play out, you'll start to see the North America business go positive in the second half. It's all about our long-term strategy of engaging with more consumers with smaller packages, more frequency, more frequently to drive value with our customers to have a better, more valuable consumer franchise. We've been executing that with our bottlers over the last few years. We've been winning in the marketplace. We're winning in the marketplace so far this year, and our strategy is on track. And therefore, I think it's important to look at those North American effects and to see them for what they are, and they are not a deviation. They're temporal and we'll be back on track with our strategy in the second half.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nNik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Nik.\nNik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: The question is on Diet Coke. Given the importance of the brand, maybe you can just give us some metrics. I mean really trying to understand the sustainability of what is happening right now. Is this just distribution pipeline fill, or are you really seeing consumer metrics, new consumers coming into the category or into the brand, et cetera, et cetera? Thank you.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. Clearly, we're doing better with Diet Coke the second quarter than the first quarter, the first half of this year than we've been doing for good number of years. And I think we were flat in the first quarter. We were minus 1% in the second quarter on volume. Clearly, Diet Coke was growing in terms of revenue second quarter and year to date, so it's materially better than we were doing before. What's it doing? Firstly, we've got packaging innovation. We've got the marketing innovation. We've got some flavor innovation. These are both allowing existing consumers to stay and continue to enjoy the franchise, and it's getting people to try it. It's not growing in aggregate yet, so there's still work to do. But it's certainly causing a reconsideration of the Diet Coke brand, and the flavors and the packaging and the marketing are part of that. I think as you ladder that up to the overall strategic answer, the interesting thing is that the success and the turnaround of Diet Coke or at least the work in progress of a turnaround of Diet Coke is not coming at the expense of Coke Zero Sugar. Coke Zero Sugar is also growing double digits in North America volumetrically, clearly high teens, double digits in terms of revenue, such that we're getting strong first half overall revenue growth and volume growth with our Zero Diet portfolio in the U.S., which is a part of our strategy to go forward. So, good numbers, much better than before, work left to do.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Bryan.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Bryan.\nBryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I had just a couple of questions around cash flow. I think the cash from operations guidance for the year has come down a little bit, so just some color in terms of what's driving that. And, Kathy, I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about still the commitment to paying down $7 billion of gross debt. And it looks like, at least year-to-date, there hasn't been that much done. So is there any connection between the cash flow and the ability to sort of hit that goal of paying down debt over the balance of the year?\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Hi, Bryan. The cash from operations, the reason we took the shift from $8.5 billion down to $8 billion is really based upon two things. That's one would be the worsening currency environment of about three to four points that we talked about. And the second really is basically this impact of an unanticipated cash tax payment that was related to two prior year tax returns and that's a timing. So that will not reverse in the current year, but we'll get that back in subsequent years. So that was why we changed the guidance. The cash from operations basically is we build it up from bottoms up. So we've got the line of sight to get to our new number. And it does not impact the $7 billion that we're going to pay down on the debt. That's how we plan to come from existing cash. That paydown, so far, you're right. We paid about $2 billion down so far this year. It is basically we're going to pay it down as it matures. So we've got maturity through 2019 to get to that $7 billion. So we are continuing and we're on track to pay down the $7 billion and the tax guidance does not impact that at all.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning, Judy.\nJudy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So I guess I wanted to dig a little bit into the EMEA performance. I think the price/mix actually was pretty strong, even though Western Europe volume was a little bit down. Obviously, the weather was positive, but you also had the UK sugar tax into France that's been kind of a tough market, so just going through maybe dissecting performance from Western Europe versus the rest of the EMEA markets and then kind of the drivers of the improved price/mix in the quarter versus what we saw in the last quarter.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. We'll try and go through those various pieces. Look, I mean, EMEA had a pretty good quarter. We had some strong performance. Now, I mean, taking some of the various factors you called out, yeah, weather was good in some places. It was actually bad in other places. It tended to be hotter and drier in the north, but rainier in the south. So I think weather is pluses and minuses on the countries, but overall it's not the biggest driver of what's going on in EMEA. In the second quarter, we had a number of very positive things occur. First, I would call out the broad scale launch of Fuze Tea across 37 markets in the EMEA group. As you will remember, we ended our joint venture with Nestl\u00e9 on BPW. We still have Nestea in a couple of countries, but, basically, we ended the joint venture, which, of course, meant from the beginning of the year, we have to have our own tea in EMEA or in the large majority of Europe and Russia, which we launched at the beginning of the year. It's driving strong performance and we're very pleased with the launch so far. The other thing that's going really well across EMEA is Coke Zero Sugar getting double-digit teens volume growth and double-digit teens revenue growth. I mean, clearly EMEA is a football part of the world. The World Cup was hosted in EMEA as well in Russia. And so we had a lot of marketing programs on Coke the trademark, which has been helping us a lot on execution behind the World Cup across EMEA, which has been helping us do well. Clearly, some of the countries we've adjusted to the sugar taxes, like the UK, but overall, I would say it was a strong quarter for the execution of the portfolio, for execution of the marketing plans. And clearly, there was some ups and downs in terms of some of the countries.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nBonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you. Good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning.\nBonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I have a question on pricing in North America. I was hoping you could give us some color on your price increase that went into effect earlier this month. I know it's early, but how confident are you that this pricing will stick and that you won't need to promote much of it back? And then, I'd be curious to hear what the general response from the retailers and then your competitors has been. Thank you.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Look, I mean, it's an off-cycle price increase, but not generally popular for a whole variety of reasons. And clearly, it's disruptive for us. It's disruptive for our customers. But I think the conversations have been about how is this going to work for each and every customer. Obviously, whilst they may understand the cost pressures are out there on freight, on the increases in steel and aluminum and other input costs that affect the bottling system and affect some of our finished products, clearly, these conversations are difficult. I think it's working its way through. We're finding ways of getting it to be implemented. I think the pricing will, in large measure, go through. I think you're starting to see that come through in Q3. And so I think it's going to be one of those things that goes through into consumer pricing. I mean, ultimately, the beverage industry is not the only industry that is facing pressure from changing imports and the need to take pricing, whatever has been the driver of those input costs. And I think that that's partly just the general environment. So it's going through. It's been difficult, but I think the systems done a good job of helping the retailers. And in the end, we're focused on coming back to our central story, which is, okay, yeah, this is a price increase, but our focus is on helping you grow revenues and profits in your business with our brands and with the beverage categories that we often lead. And so I think it's positive.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Chappell from SunTrust. Your line is now open.\nWilliam B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Bill.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Bill.\nWilliam B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: A quick quantification. Did you or could you quantify on the Brazil strike kind of what that impact had on the top-line in the quarter? And then on the pricing in North America, just trying to understand of the four kind of issues that hit 2Q, are you just pricing for freight? I mean, or are you pricing for more than freight? I'm just trying to understand how much you need in terms of to offset that in the back half?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Look, we're not calling out numbers on Brazil. All we said is that we were slightly negative and we would have probably been positive if it hadn't been for the strike. So let me talk about the North American one. Bear in mind that there's multiple types of price. The price increase I just talked about on the last question is predominantly the price increase from the bottling system on the sparkling brands in particular, which faced a whole series of input costs: freight, yes; plastic resins, yes; metal in all its various forms for many reasons, including tariffs. So there is some broad-based push on input costs that have kind of come in and affected us and many other industries as well. And that's what's driving the price increase that we took in the middle of the year, which was kind of the off-cycle price increase. When it comes to the North American business that is in our accounting, obviously, the sparkling price increase the bottlers take will eventually flow through to the concentrate business on our sparkling side. The price increases that I talk about on juice, we took that effectively in the first half of the year, which is already planned with the retailers and the change in the packaging size that came into effect around the beginning of the second quarter. So there are a lot of moving pieces here on pricing in North America and I think it's important to disaggregate them. But again, once you disaggregate them, step back and come back to the overall picture, which is the categories are getting positive pricing. We've had positive pricing in the U.S. for several years now. We're focused on pricing, growing transactions, growing revenue, helping the customers grow and winning in the marketplace with more consumers.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Dara.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Dara.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, Kathy, just one detailed question first, can you give us a sense for how much the FX hedging from 2018 is helping offset the EPS impact from currency? I just wanted to get a sense of the potential headwind in 2019 as the hedges unwind. And then, the real question is on Latin America. The results were obviously strong in the quarter. We've seen a lot of political currency and economic volatility in the region recently. So I just want to get an update on your level of confidence if the momentum can continue in the second half and I guess your view of the potential impact on your business or any risk in that region from the external environment here.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Which one do you want? The gains?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Do you want to do the gains?\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. So, hi, Dara. The hedging gains in this year, actually we're cycling hedging gains from the prior year, which are impacting us in this year, particularly in EMEA. So they are obviously hedging gains are helping to offset to some extent. But really they're more of a cycling issue for us for this year. And so therefore, the next year, which I think was your underlying question, next year, I really don't anticipate that there will be much impact with us having to cycle hedging gains from 2018 into 2019.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, and then on Latin America?\nTimothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.: That sounds like a second question. We'll come back to it.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Do you want me to do that? I'm feeling benevolent.\nDara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: The first one was an easy one.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: I don't believe it.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: So you're going to answer it, wow.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Maybe I'm feeling benevolent. I don't know what's going on here. Latin America, look, I think partly \u2013 we had a good start in Latin America, no doubt about it. We did call out \u2013 Latin America is one of those places where you need to look at a few quarters averaged together because it can be volatile. And the outlook there is there are some clouds on the horizon, but you know what? The thing can also turn positive. I think sometimes the fears of what might happen are much greater than actually what happens. That may be true of Mexico. I think the Mexican environment looks like it's going to be stable and positive. Brazil, the strike is over. Clearly, the Brazilian economy is doing better than it was doing last year and the last few years. Argentina is looking a little more tricky. But look, we've been here before in Latin America several times. I don't think there's something that says everything suddenly all going to go wrong. So I think we've got a good plan for the second half in Latin America, together with our bottling partners. We're focused on growing the business. It's a part of the world we all understand, and I think we've got great plans to engage with the customers and the consumers.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAndrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you and good morning, everyone.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Hi, Andrea.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nAndrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hello, how are you? So you have discussed at length how the refranchising has helped improved performance, in particular in North America. And now, as you're starting to lap more and more territories, are you seeing any signs that trends may be slowing in some of these markets? And if not, because of tough comparisons, or are you still seeing the solid momentum building? Thank you.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. I think the short answer is we've got continued momentum. We have volume growth in the U.S., which we didn't have for a long time. We've got positive pricing there. So I think the execution of the bottlers continues to be strong. Our partners remain pleased, exciting. Arca announced a big investment recently. So I think there's a lot of belief that we can continue to do well in North America. We have a good strategy. As you look around the rest of the world, we had a very good first half in China. We refranchised the system in China. We've now got two really strong partners with COFCO and with Swire. And we had a much better start to the year in China, good volume growth, good revenue growth. And again, as you go around, look at either the refranchisings we've done or new bottler combinations that are coming to being around the world, and even honestly some of our existing bottlers who want to be part of the refranchising continue to invest and continue to grow. So the system remains strong. Of course, there are countries here and there that are challenging. The system remains strong. It's executing, and so therefore, collectively we're all doing better. I think the headline growth by the company is symbolic and a proxy for the fact the system, this bottling system is also doing better.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Pablo Zuanic with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.\nAatish Shah - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hi. Good morning. This is Aatish Shah on for Pablo. Just one question, the price/mix in LatAm increased 12% in the quarter versus 6% in 1Q. But margins fell in 2Q after increasing in the prior quarter. Can you provide some color on that dynamic regarding that pricing cost versus margins?\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yes, so pricing was up 12% in the quarter and that was driven from strong price/mix in Mexico, Brazil, South Latin. So operational price/mix was up as well as then the timing of some deductions that were reversing from Q1 of last year. So when you talk about margins, though, the operating margins are down 120 basis points. Comparable operating margins are down, but year-to-date margins are up 80 basis points. And that is driven pretty much from structural. So we had structural in this year as we are refranchising a couple of bottlers in Latin America, and that's offset by some currency and a little bit from the accounting change. But the underlying business in Latin America expanded and is doing well. So most of that 80 points of year-to-date margin expansion is due to the underlying business and the strong price/mix.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie. Your line is now open.\nCaroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Hello.\nCaroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the fact that there was a bit of over-shipment in the first quarter and continued slight over-shipment in the second quarter. Does that reverse in the back half, or what are inventories like overall? And how does more finished good product affect that, just a little discussion around timing of shipments and what to look for in the back half?\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. Overall concentrate CSD sales, at the headline level, in line with unit cases, and of course there's one day less in the first half, which on a straight line basis is about 0.5 point, one day in 180. So it's not a massive difference. In theory, it will reverse itself in the second half, which in a way is a small headwind in the second half. But I think I wouldn't over-engineer the thing. There's no big buildup of inventory of concentrates or finished products. It's largely a building ahead of a strong summer, a strong marketing program with FIFA. Therefore, I think it evens itself out over time. We may be fractionally ahead in the year-to-date. Maybe it'll come off in the remainder of the year, but it's always in the bounds of what we're expecting.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.\nVivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning, Vivien.\nVivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: So we recently got the biannual use consumption data for the U.S., which, not surprisingly, showed consistent declines, which you've been seeing over the last decade, for high school past week soda consumption. But we don't, as far as I know, have this data for any international market. So, James, I was wondering. Can you just comment on what's happening on with like use soda consumption in like other developed markets? Thanks.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Yeah. I mean, look, the Coca-Cola sparkling beverage category is in developed countries is in slight volume growth with positive pricing. Our strategy is to focus on transactions. We'd rather have more transactions, even if that meant flat or even slightly less volume, but more transactions with less calories and with more revenue. And we think that'll create a stronger franchise. And I think that's what you're seeing in the numbers across the developed markets. And I think when you look at incidence rates, as we would call them, by young adults, then I think you see people starting to reengage with the category as we bring out smaller packages, as we bring out zero sugar options. And so I think we're starting to see that trend in the U.S. come to a different place and that's the strategy that we're following. We think it's going to play out over time. Now, the reality is the reason we're doing Beverages for Life is also because it's not going to go back to what it was 40 years ago when there were relatively limited choice about the number of beverages. When you look at any consumption patent data across the developed world or, in fact, the developing or the emerging, the two biggest factors to call out is people continue to come into the commercial beverage market. Incidence rates for commercial beverages continue to go up. Yes, they're trying to have less calories, but total incidents of commercial beverages is going up. But it's more diversified. Therefore, if we want to have and engage with the vibrant industry that's growing, we need a bigger portfolio. So we need to do justice and maintain the relevancy of the sparkling category, which is about consumer engagement, the marketing, but also smaller packages and the zero calories and some innovation, but also about winning in some of the other categories we've chosen to focus on. Consumers are buying more beverages, but they are buying it because of diversity.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nKevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Good morning.\nTimothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.: Hey, Kevin.\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Good morning.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Morning.\nKevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: A couple, if I could slip them in, James, could we get an update on the timing for the CCBA transaction? I think last we heard, it was going to be, or at least the thinking was, end of September, which would suggest we could have heard something by now, but it's been relatively quiet. So an update there would be helpful. And then, Kathy, a quick point of clarification on the EPS guidance, just as we sort of like tumble through the numbers that's enabled the company to maintain the 8% to 10% EPS growth. So FX, freight, commodities, it worsened. Perhaps investment levels are higher in North America to match Pepsi. You can comment on the last one, if you'd like to, but top line better. Price increases in operating leverage. What else has come in sort of a bit better? Is it on the productivity side that's enabled the company to offset the higher FX rate, et cetera, for the year? So if you could comment there, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: You want to take the last one?\nKathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. So on the EPS guidance, obviously, the underlying business continues to perform well, as evidenced by us taking up our OI targets. I think the thing you're not focusing on is first, there's less deleveraging below the line than we previously talked about earlier in the year. So given the way currencies have moved, that impact is actually less on profit before tax than it is on operating income. And then, we also have, as you remember, there was another accounting change that moved pension, split the pension cost, and part of it is now below the line, which also puts a little bit more volatility in other income, but that's helping some of that deleveraging below the line, so below operating income. So all-in, we feel good about the underlying business and then we've got enough other things that are helping us to stay within our guidance.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nRobert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI: Thank you very much. And congratulations on another strong quarter.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Thanks, Robert.\nRobert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI: One area that you haven't talked about too much recently is Africa. And perhaps you could give us a little bit of sense to how the business is operating in South Africa and then the rest of Africa. And then maybe touch on the CCBA situation. If there's any kind of new issues or any things that have come up that perhaps weren't expected at the beginning of the year. Thank you.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: Sure. So, I mean, Africa is doing well. We had some pretty broad-based growth in Africa in the second quarter and in the first half of the year. We've always had a good business in Africa. We're one of the biggest private businesses, ultimately, with our bottling partners, in Africa. We make a lot of investments there. We think it's got an excellent long term future. And we continue to invest. I mean, just in the second quarter, we did well in Nigeria and some of the other kind of northern and eastern countries in Africa. As it relates to South Africa, I'll say something about South Africa and then I'll relate it to the CCBA because it's not related. In South Africa, we didn't do so well in the second quarter. That was anticipated because of the implementation of the sugar tax in South Africa in Q2. We had a reasonably good plan. I don't think we perhaps were as aggressive on the reformulations as we should have been. Competitors were more aggressive. And so we quickly course-corrected in the quarter and now we're better. So in the short term, the biggest thing that's happened in South Africa is the implementation of the sugar tax and we've adjusted and are sorting ourselves out for that. And things will get better into the second half. Nothing that's happened in the second quarter is related to the timing on CCBA. Everyone knew that the sugar tax was going to come in. As was previously commented, we talked about trying to sort this out by the back half of the year. Clearly, the process was a little slower at the beginning for a number of regulatory and approval reasons, slow in getting started. It's up and running. We've got a number of interested parties, existing bottlers, potential new South African partners. The data rooms are up and running. The management presentations have happened and we're expecting to get back indicative proposals in the coming months. And of course in the end, it goes back to what it always will be. Once we've got those, we'll be asking ourselves the question, do we have the right partner, with the right philosophy, with the right investment plan? And can we do this at the right price? We're looking to sell, of course, at the price that sets them up for success, but recognizes the value of the asset. And hopefully, that will all come together in the coming months and we'll be on track, but we are going to do the right thing for the business there. Hopefully, we'll get the right answer, but we're going to focus on making sure we continue to invest for the long term in South Africa and the rest of Africa. It's a vibrant continent and we're very positive on the growth of each and every country there going forward.\nJames Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.: So with that, let me say thank you very much to everyone for joining the call. To conclude, we had a strong first half of the year. Our performance reflects the ongoing cultural shifts in our business, embracing change, focusing on growth with discipline and becoming increasingly entrepreneurial in spirit. This has resulted in an acceleration in our business and we remain focused on delivering our full year EPS guidance. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us today. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. All participants will be on listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations Department if they have any questions. I\u2019d now like to introduce Mr. Tim Leveridge, Vice President and Investor Relations Officer. Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.\nTim Leveridge: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Waller, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report. We have posted schedules under the Financial Reports & Information tab in the Investors section of our company website. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during the morning's discussion, to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. Finally during today\u2019s call when our senior executives referred to comparable performance, they were referring to comparable performance from continuing operations. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one question, please ask your most pressing question first, and then reenter to the queue. Now let me turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Tim, and good morning everyone. 2018 is of to a good start back by strong financial performance and volume acceleration. Our results build on our continued execution against the strategic priorities that we first shared with you more than a year ago, accelerating ad transformation into total beverage with a broad consumer centric brand portfolio and asset light business model and a performance driven growth culture. Our strategies are working and while our quarterly facing will be lumpy, we\u2019re on track to deliver our plan this year. Improving global economy help non-alcoholic beverage industry grow a little faster and our actions enabled us to gain global value share. During the quarter, we delivered 5% organic revenue growth driven by growth across all our operating segments. Concentrating shipments grew 4% driven by an acceleration at developing and emerging markets as well as the timing of shipments during the quarter. And price/mix was 1% trending lower than our recent rate largely due to timing across multiple markets as well as the few factors impacting North America during the quarter. Those of you who followed us closely will know that our organic revenue composition was driven more by volume and less by price than last year. While I expected top-line composition, however, to be more balanced between volume and price/mix over the remainder of the year, I am encouraged with the stock for this year and the sustainability of that growth. Importantly, I am also pleased that we converted top-line growth into 9% underlying operating income growth even in the face of arising cost environment. As such I am confident in our ability to achieve our bottom line outlook. Looking around the world, organic revenue growth and volume growth were broad based we\u2019ve grown across every operating segments. In addition to momentum in the business, volume benefited from the timing of Easter and Chinese New Year this year. We also saw revenue and volume growth in each of our category clusters as we continue to focus on our total beverage platform. Even as we evolve our portfolio, our foundation is strong. For example, Trademark Coca-Cola led the way growing volume a healthy 4% globally due to improving trends in our developing and emerging markets along with strong momentum in our low and no calorie beverage. In North America, organic revenue grew 1% as stronger volume growth was partially offset by 1% decline in price/mix. We delivered solid performance in the marketplace gaining value share, innovation across our multiple category clusters including sparkling and Zero Sugar portfolio drove strong consumer update. North American price/mix declined 1% as positive low single-digit underlying price was offset by a few factors which Kathy will walk you through. We have given the change in reported price/mix; I want to be clear our pricing strategy have not changed. We have seen clear benefit in our move from volume centric to value centric mindset and that velocity have not changed. You can see evidence of this as we achieved positive retail pricing in Nielsen all measure channels even with these during the quarter and since then we have seen retail pricing accelerated. We remain committed to take the actions needed to earn the price and value in the marketplace and we expect to achieve low single digit price/mix for our total beverage portfolio in North America again this year. Now looking at markets outside North America, Europe delivered strong organic revenue growth as we launch new products like FUZE TEA while continuing to drive revenue growth management initiatives. China and India have accelerated top-line growth in the quarter and we also saw better performance in some of the markets that have been struggling, notably Brazil and Argentina. And let me just talk a little bit about some of the actions we have taken to achieve these results. Across all our markets and especially in the development markets, consumers are seeking more beverage choices while looking for products that fit different needs, moods and moments. To meet these desires, we are shaping and expanding our portfolio through innovation, expansion of the list, shift and scale model and bolt-on M&A all being driven by disciplined approach to growth. For example, the global ready-to-drink tea category represents $60 billion in retail value and is projected to continue growing solidly as consumers seek out more natural beverage choices that can deliver functional benefits. Our tea portfolio has grown over the past several years cheaply behind the strength of brands, FUZE TEA, Ayataka and Gold Peak as well as strong local and regional brands such as Honest Tea. Earlier I mentioned the launch of FUZE TEA in Europe. At the end of last year, FUZE TEA was available in almost 50 countries, but not yet been launched in Europe. At the beginning of this year, we initiated a complex rollout. This required a flexible and agile approach as we successfully launched the brands in 37 countries in a single day, but we still have a lot of distribution to build, we are ahead of plan. With this expansion, we have effectively doubled the value of the FUZE TEA brand globally. This is a great example of how we can rapidly lift and shipped proven successful brands and scale them quickly. We are also working to get high growth brands we have acquired. Last October, we have acquired the U.S. rights to Topo Chico premium sparkling mineral water for Mexico. With that with the intent of using our venturing and emerging brands unit as an incubated guide the expansion in the brand\u2019s distribution footprint. By the end of the first quarter, our first full quarter of ownership, we increased distribution coverage within the highly valuable convenience retail channel by 25%. Finally, we continue to innovate in our core brands. I\u2019ve spoke before about our success with Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. During the first quarter, the Brand continued its trend of strong double-digit volume and revenue growth globally. And in North America, we've been working hard to reinvigorate the Diet Coke brand through an integrated approach. We introduced new packaging, a new marketing campaign and new flavors designed to appeal to the next generation consumers. We\u2019ve got off to a strong start returning Diet Coke to growth in North America. Now, we recognized it's still very early in the process, but we are encouraged by the initial consumer response. Importantly, I'm pleased to see the team take bold action to change the trajectory of the results. Our strategy is to focus on specific growth disciplines and capabilities. Digital marketing is a capability that helps us to build strong connections with younger consumers. For example, during Chinese New Year, we launched a digital marketing campaign with one of the country's largest online and mobile payment providers. This integrated campaign connected brand Coca-Cola with a cultural rituals of Chinese New Year through an augmented reality shopper\u2019s smartphone [ph] experience. Packaging innovation is another capability that plays an important role in building and maintaining relevance, particularly when coupled with broader marketing campaigns. Again in China, we created sleek cans with localized labels portraying cities across the country. We partnered with leading Internet providers to create an integrated digital experience where consumers learn more about these cities by scanning the counter on their mobile devices. This premium price revenue growth initiatives has been very successful in interacting a new generation of Chinese consumers. The two digital initiatives I just described are help to generate nearly 1 billion consumer impressions and supported the strong performance of Brand Coca-Cola in China where volume grew over 20% in the quarter. With so much going on in our business, it\u2019s kind of sounded to be challenging to setback and see the commonalities of driving \u2013 that is driving our performance across the various categories and geographies. However, when I think about it, the shift in our culture, one that is moving faster, taking more risks and approaching growth with discipline, this is the single largest driver of our performance. For example after launching FUZE TEA in Western Europe, we had an opportunity to enhance the attractiveness of our packaging to work with Coca-Cola European partners to revamp the packaging just launched, revamp the passion graphics in less than eight weeks. At the end of the day, speed and agility are critical for the success in this rapidly changing consumer landscape. Of course, all of this is supported by a stronger global bottling system. Our bottling partners are energized. They are investing in capabilities and assets, driving enhanced execution and focused on bringing a total beverage portfolio to the customers. Looking towards the reminder of the year, there's a lot of activity ahead. We are implementing new revenue growth management initiatives in several countries, launching new products across geographies and adapting to new taxes in certain markets like the U.K. and South Africa. With that said I'm confident in our overall plan and with the guidance we laid out at the beginning of the year. Specifically, we expect to deliver 4% organic revenue growth and 8% to 10% comparable EPS growth this year. Kathy, over to you.\nKathy Waller: Thanks and good morning everyone. We delivered solid underlying financial results slightly ahead of our expectations due to the timing of shipments with 5% organic revenue growth and operating expense leverage driving 9% growth in underlying operating income. This translated into strong comparable EPS growth of 8%. And based on where we stand today, we remain confident that we can deliver our full year guidance of 4% organic revenue growth and 8% to 10% comparable EPS growth. Today, I will cover three topics: price/mix, our comparable results and our outlook. Starting with price/mix, as James mentioned, our consolidated price/mix turned at lower than our recent run rate largely due to timing as well as a few factors impacting North America during the quarter. However, as we move through the year, we expect the timing factors to reverse into a net benefit and for the pressures in North America to moderate, resulting in stronger global price/mix. In North America price/mix during the quarter was unfavorably impacted by the timing of new product launches, incremental outbound freight costs and the shift of the Easter holiday. Like other CPG companies, we faced significant headwinds in North America this year. Historically, we have accounted for the cost of outbound freight as reduction from revenue. Therefore, it impacts our price/mix calculations. We estimate that this will be a 1-point impact on North America\u2019s full year price/mix or be more front loaded due to the timing of when freight costs began increasing last year. Outside of North America, emerging and developing markets outpaced developed markets in both our Asia Pacific and EMEA operating groups, impacting price/mix at the group level. However, at the local level, we generated positive price/mix in most of our markets. And in Latin America, we continued to benefit from strong price/mix in our Mexico and South Latin business units while operating in an overall low inflationary environment. Turing to our comparable financial performance in the quarter, as I mentioned on our fourth quarter call, there are two factors creating noise in our comparable financial performance this year, with varying impacts by quarter and by operating segment. So first, structural. We expect comparable revenue and operating income to decline on an absolute basis. The growth in operating margins to improve as we cycle exiting lower margins, capital intensive businesses last year. Second, [indiscernible]. As we mentioned on the fourth quarter call, two new accounting standards went into effect this quarter. The first required companies to split out net pension expense, keeping these service costs and SG&A and moving other components of pension expense to other income. So in accordance, we issued reclassified 2017 quarterly and full year financial information on April 3rd and now to you are comparable. The second pertains to revenue recognition. The primary impact this quarter is that certain revenue and costs and contracts that were previously netted together in revenue are now grossed up into the revenue [indiscernible] components. We expect this to result in higher growth in both comparable net revenue and cost of goods sold, with no material impact to gross profit or operating income for the full year. However, this will mathematically affect the calculation of growth and operating margins. An example is outbound freight. We just now, after the implementation of the new revenue recognition standard, accounted for as part of cost of goods sold. As I said earlier, this was previously recorded as a reduction to revenue price of the customer includes outbound freight. However, we applied this accounting change perspective does not restate our historical financial statement. Therefore, in organic revenue, we have adjusted for that change to make our 2018 quarterly results comparable to the 2017 compared to the period. As a result, both our organic revenue growth and price/mix will continue to be impacted by the outbound freight costs this year. So looking at our performance in the quarter, comparable net revenue declined as organic revenue growth and benefits from the new accounting standard and a currency tailwind were more than offset by a 26% structural impact from cycling bottler refranchising last year. However, comparable operating margin increased 600 basis points due to refranchising and strong underlying performance, partially offset by an almost 100 basis point impact from the new accounting standards. Below the line, higher net interest expense offset higher other income and equity income in the quarter and our lower effective tax rate and net share repurchases contributed to comparable EPS of $0.47, up 8% in the quarter. Finally, we generated approximately $340 million of free cash flow, up 5% driven by reduced capital investment needs as we divest bottling operations, partially offset by the impact of one less day in the quarter. Now looking at the remainder of the year, our full year guidance remains intact, 45 organic revenue, 8% to 10% comparable EPS growth and at least $8.5 billion in cash from operations. As you model the flow of the year, there are a few items to consider in terms of phasing. Consistent with what we said on the fourth quarter call, we still expect full year EPS growth to be driven by the second half of the year, primarily due to the timing of expenses and productivity initiatives. Also in the first quarter, concentrate shipment outpace the volume growth, particularly in our EMEA operating segment. This pulls some revenue and profit into the first quarter. As we move through the remainder of the year, we expect this to normalize, with full year concentrate shipment running in line with unit case volume growth. Now there are also a few things to consider specific the second quarter. We are adapting to new sugar excise taxes in both the U.K. and South Africa while cycling strong results from Western Europe last year. While we feel confident in our strategies and ability to adapt our portfolio to the new operating environment, we expect some level of impact, particularly as consumers first adjust to the new prices. And we are cycling a low SG&A base last year due to the timing of expenses. From a nonoperational perspective, we expect a 4 to 5 point headwind from structural items and a 1 point headwind from currency on operating income. And we expect to change in revenue recognition to be a 1 to 2 point tailwind to revenue. And while we still expect the revenue recognition to have no impact to operating income for the full year, we do expect a 2 point headwind to operating income in the second quarter that reverse in the third quarter. So these considerations taken together will put pressure on comparable EPS in the second quarter relative to our full year targets. As always, our Investor Relations team will be happy to walk through each element in more detail as you build out your models for the year. So in summary, we delivered solid underlying financial performance in the quarter. This translated into strong comparable EPS growth and we are on track to deliver our full year guidance of 8% to 10% comparable EPS growth. Operator, we are now ready for questions?\nOperator: Thank you, speakers. We will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s conference. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nDara Mohsenian: Good morning.\nJames Quincey: Well, good morning.\nKathy Waller: Good morning.\nDara Mohsenian: So I just wanted to touch on the mix of your organic sales growth in the quarter. Clearly, we saw shift away from price/mix more to volume growth, which is opposite of what we've seen in the last few years. And don't get me wrong, it was great overall result, but I just wanted you to sort of flesh that out a bit more. A, on the volume front, are you feeling more comfortable there with the good Q1 result? What drove the pickup? How sustainable is it? Maybe can touch on emerging markets there. And then B, on pricing, should we expect more modest pricing going forward? And why? And I heard the comments about underlying pricing being solid in North America for Coke. But with your key competitors seeing weaker pricing in scanner data and some pushback we've heard from retailers around pricing across the CPG landscape, I'd love sort of an update on the competitive environment commentary in the U.S. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure, let me start with the volume. I mean I think volume has accelerated across the board. As I mentioned in the comments, it's not just broadly geographically based. It's broad in terms of the categories. So there is no silver bullet or one lever there. It's really the sum, the right strategies, the innovation, the programs, the execution by the bottlers that are creating value for the customer. It's really a broad-based effort that has been ongoing across the system. Yes, the macros in some of the emerging markets have improved slightly, and of course, that is helping a little bit. So I think it's broad-based for the right reasons. And I make that point because, actually, what we're doing in pricing is also consistent with the strategy and what we've been doing for the last number of years. So actually, the two things are working together. But let me make a couple of points on pricing. Firstly, now that we've refranchised so much about bottling revenue, the revenue of us as a concentrate business or largely a concentrate business is further down the supply chain. So some of these timing impacts of shipments or other things tend to be a little magnified but more magnified than they were in the past when you look at some of the groups. I think that's just worth bearing in mind going forward. And then when you look at pricing on a global basis, as we talked about, underlying pricing in the marketplace is good. It's very consistent with what we've been doing over the last few years. But there are certain types of timing effects that have reduced how that looks in the P&L. So the marketplace has the pricing. In a way, our operational pricing through to the marketplace is consistent with what's going on in the marketplace. But globally, that has been reduced coming into the P&L for a couple of timing things. One, some of the gallons that we sold in the first quarter, which were ahead of cases, were particularly in some of the developing and emerging markets where the average price tends to be a bit lower. And so that kind of mechanically brings down the price. That's a quarter-to-quarter effect that will wash itself out. Similarly, we had a timing effect that brought out more revenue reductions into the first quarter. So again, that will wash itself out in the rest of the year. Some of the stuff that is more ongoing geographic mix, the developing, the reemergence of the developing and emerging markets, which is good for volume, tends to be a little more pressure on price/mix. And a lower inflation in Latin America, those perhaps is a little more contained. But we absolutely believe that once you look past these kind of quarter to quarter effect, you will see good global pricing going forward very consistent with what we have been doing over the last few years. And then specifically, our North America, the minus one is not consistent with where we expect the full year to end up. There are a number of things in North America. One is the timing is much more -- the Easter is much more in the first quarter. The freight that Kathy talked about and then we're giving a kind of an old accounting comparison where is a deduction for revenue, and that will mitigate as we go into the rest of the year. And then we're cycling some of the big innovations in the first quarter over last year, which drove up price per gallon and some of the packaging stuff we're doing. All of these things will moderate in North America for the rest of the year. And so we haven't our strategy. You can see in the Nielsen's that we're getting pricing in the marketplace. We fully expect that to continue for the rest of the year. And so low single digit is much more likely for North America, and that's our expectation. So we have an outlook of 4% globally for the full year. We expect that to be balanced between volume and price. And so we look through these quarterly of the timing of things, which as I said a little more magnified now given that business model. We are on track with our strategy and execution.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nBryan Spillane: Good morning everyone.\nKathy Waller: Good morning.\nJames Quincey: Good morning, Bryan.\nBryan Spillane: I guess, James in your prepared remarks you have mentioned or Kathy I guess, you have mentioned Great Britain in the second quarter and the sugar tax. And now that it's in the market, can you just give any sort of early read, not so much on performance, but just how the consumers reacted to it, how you feel like your marketing, your messaging around the preparing for this has resonated with consumers? Just any sort of early sort feedback I guess if you will in terms of it being in the market and how consumers are responding to it? It would be helpful.\nJames Quincey: Bryan, good morning. I honestly think it's too early, but let me tell you what we've been doing and what's been happening. The U.K. sugar tax, unlike some other countries, is actually a tier tax. So at the certain level of sugar, it\u2019s one level of tax. You go down and sugar, it's a more moderate tax and then below a certain level, there's no tax. But we have done a number of things. We have reformulated a number of our major brands that reduced the sugar level. We have really pushed hard on the One Brand strategy for Coca-Cola. So we still have Coke original there, but we put really hard on Coke Zero and really hard on the invigorating Diet Coke such that about two thirds of that total portfolio will not pay the sugar tax because of the way we have adapted the reformulations for the GB marketplace. On top of that, we've put a lot of emphasis on smaller packaging in the GB marketplace and changes in packaging sizes to try and accommodate this in the way that shoppers actually go for the occasions and the rituals that they are part of in the U.K. So we've been building towards this. This is obviously something that's been in the works for long time [indiscernible] tax that we have adapted. So the first thing is I think about we actually the rest of the industry and the retailers have adopted a lot of this regime. So I don't think it's going to be as disruptive for the marketplace as perhaps some of the other ones. Yet, it is also going to reduce calories effectively. And that's been in the marketplace, I guess, now for three weeks. It is worth nothing that in the course of those three weeks, it's been like the hardest Easter like for a long time. It was like 29 degrees centigrade last weekend in the U.K. So I'm sure the beverage industry is pretty well in those first three weeks kind of irrespective of pricing. But it's way too early to call. I think the GB team has done a great job with Coca-Cola European partners in preparing for this. I'm sure it will have some disruption on Coke original in Q2. The rest of the portfolio is set up to continue with the pricing strategy we have before. So I don't think it is going to be too disruptive, but I think there will be some impact.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nNik Modi: Yeah, thanks. Good morning everyone.\nJames Quincey: Hi.\nKathy Waller: Hi.\nNik Modi: Maybe some thoughts James from you on early metrics on the Diet Coke relaunch. I know it's still early. I know, obviously, it did well in terms of retail display activity, et cetera. But maybe you can just key us in on what you're seeing at a consumer level in the early innings.\nJames Quincey: Sure, yeah, I mean \u2013 I am not a big fan of drawing a trend line through one quarter. Look, we did three things. We've been learning over last couple of years. The team has been learning on what is going to help a great ramp like Diet Coke reengage with some of the last consumers and with new consumers. And I think this round, we came up with some good marketing, soma reinvigorated packaging, shapes, sizes and looks and, obviously, the flavors -- the innovation on the flavors. And I think the combination of those three things was bold enough and interesting enough to not just engage some of the people who, perhaps that blast from Diet Coke but also millennials and even some of the people who are, perhaps, drinking flavored sparkling water. So I think, when you look at where the change in volume trend is coming from, it's those three groups, which is good news for a brand like Diet Coke. I don't know what\u2019s going to happen in Q2, I hope the trend continues. As we say, we put a lot of our effort in Q1. But whichever way it goes, whether it continues or softens a little in Q2, I think we are learning some interesting things about what it takes to reinvigorate Diet Coke and brand. And so I'm encouraging the team to continue to learn and be bold with the next round of actions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlos Laboy from HSBC. Your line is now open.\nCarlos Laboy: Yes, good morning everyone.\nJames Quincey: Good morning.\nKathy Waller: Good morning.\nCarlos Laboy: James you have touched on this throughout the call, but with another quarter of experimentation done, can you expand on some of the examples that would inform us externally that the firm is becoming a bolder consumer-centric brand rather than brand-centric company?\nJames Quincey: Yeah, I think clearly, we\u2019re pushing the idea of experimentation. Not experimentation for the sake of experimentation, but in the service of the consumer, in the service of wondering what will connect and engage with the consumer. And I think several of you heard me being use the old adage of never say never. And I think that was the main goal of doing anything that's great and it's about reconnecting with the consumer. And I think that's allowing us to go I think beyond our previous boundaries; whether it's the campaign that I just talked about on Diet Coke; whether it's the rapid expansion around the world of AdeS, which is the soy-based plant drink that we bought in Latin America and we've taken to Europe; whether it's the speed with which we've tried some of the reformulations on sugar reduction in Latin America or even some of the beverage innovation in Japan. I mean, it's all about trying to connect with the consumer. And then when we got something, let's not be shy about moving it around the world quickly, sometimes we have had good successes. We've been shy about moving them around the world. We've got to lift them. We've got to shift them. We got to scale quickly. And examples of that are things like smartwater and FUZE TEA. And the last thought I'll leave you with on experimentation is we've got to be willing to kill the zombies. We can't have experimentation that is either success or continuation. There has to be, no, this is a great -- it was a good idea. It didn't work for whatever reason, and it needs to be -- it needs to be pulled out because that's also a key part of experimenting is redirecting the resources to the next idea or doubling down on something that works.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Powers from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nStephen Powers: Thanks. Good morning.\nJames Quincey: Hi.\nStephen Powers: Hey, so a question on North American operating income. It looks like growth there was down noticeably in the quarter. Segment margins, I think, were down 400 basis points if my quick math is correct. And I just hoped you could bridge those year-over-year movements for me. How much was elevated freight effector versus accounting changes, the innovation and the Easter-led investments you mentioned? Just I would have thought that the underlying pricing ongoing productivity, the strong sparkling performance that we saw from a mix perspective would have all benefited margins more than we might be seeing. And maybe just a part of it, but just specifically the release says that profit was unfavorably impacted by a 6 point headwind from intercompany profit eliminations, elimination benefits last year, just can you remind us what that was? Sorry for the rambling question, but I guess, what I'm trying to figure out is the 21% segment margin that we\u2019re seeing this quarter is that representative of what we might be seeing going forward or is it artificially depressed by some of the factors that we should be taking into effect? Thanks.\nKathy Waller: So, good morning, Steve. So, yes, margins for this quarter were compressed. And one part of that is that intercompany profit elimination that you talked about, that was a 6-point headwind at operating income. As you remember when we transition territories, we take onetime benefit from being able to recognize the profit that we originally had to eliminate when they became intercompany. And that went to the numbers last -- fourth quarter of 2017, and now we have to cycle that and the same amount went down the P&L. So it's one amount of revenue, and it's the same amount of operating income, but it has a different impact at operating income, so the 6 point headwind at operating income. And then the other factors as we talked about revenue recognition, that's about 150 basis points margin headwind in North America although dollars are not compressed, but that is a margin headwind. And then there are a couple of other things with some timing of SG&A in the quarter. And then there are cost pressures that we talked about earlier on inputs and things like juice and then there are freight costs. So all of those things are the factors that you\u2019re seeing in the compression for North America.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJudy Hong: Thank you. Good morning.\nKathy Waller: Good morning.\nJames Quincey: Good morning, Judy.\nJudy Hong: So, James, I guess I wanted to get a little bit more color on Latin America. I think it was one of the regions where it was going to be, perhaps, a swing factor this year in where it was going to be, perhaps, a swing factor this year in improving off of the 2017 base. And you saw a little bit of an improvement in Brazil, but it sounds like maybe there's more to go there. So just a little bit of color broadly there. And if I kind of hear your comments about revenue growth expectation for the full year of 4%, seems like if Lat Am comes up even more, there's maybe a little bit of room to do better. At the same time, maybe your comments on Europe is a bit cautious, tax issues, weather comp issue, et cetera. So just kind of reconciling those two comments. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure, I think Latin America clearly improved particularly Brazil and Argentina. I think as a point of reference or contract is that we're doing good last year but it\u2019s not that we've gone from okay to great. It's we've gone from bad to okay, and there was modest volume growth in Brazil and Argentina. Now that's not to under appreciated work of the teams and to the bottlers in those countries, but they've been tough micro economically. They've been working very hard on revamping hard on revamping the packaging, revamping the execution, revamping the marketing. And they're starting to get some reward for their troubles. But it's still not out of the woods in the case of some of those countries. And no doubt, the improvement will be a bit lumpy. But we're starting to see that plans they put in place, the returnables in Brazil and the return to growth in sparkling working and some of the category growth working in Argentina. So there's volume growth, which -- I mean, most of last year, we were declining in Latin America. So we\u2019re going to gain on the volume, maybe a bit lumpy, but we're going again on the volume. It's worth saying that inflationary pressure is coming down in Latin America. So off -- you've got less pricing, perhaps, than we had over the last few years in Latin America, but a better volume performance. So I am not sure it\u2019s going to get an outsized change in trend from what we're seeing, but I think it\u2019s a better underlying fundamental. So I am not sure, I would see that balancing back that Latin America because one thing is sort of offsetting the other thing, but it's kind of a healthier mix.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning.\nJames Quincey: Good morning.\nKathy Waller: Hi.\nLauren Lieberman: I wanted to go back to freight again, separate from how the accounting change is impacting the presentation. But I was just curious, I guess, how much freight is up kind of year-over-year in North America because I'm just -- I guess I'm surprised by how much it's still impacting you, given refranchising. So maybe, in that context, it'd also be helpful to just articulate what you still distribute yourself because I know there's quite a bit but it\u2019s not a 100% refranchising. How freight is actually flowing through the impact of the business as much. Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yeah, so I will start and if doesn't work that well, then Kathy will help me out. Freight in North America is up like 20% or something. I mean freight is up a lot and that\u2019s a consequence of the change in regulation in terms of number of hours that the drivers can drive, et cetera, et cetera, and the way the organization of the freight is put together, and there've been changes to regulations. And that does to some extent reduced the number of drivers or reduced the number of hours. And so freight is up 20%. Why is freight relevant for us? While, we still have some in North America, even postre-franchising, we still have two bits of the business where we are kind of selling to customer, that\u2019s the business, where we\u2019re selling direct to them. So we still got freight involved there to the final end user. And we provide a lot of the hot fill products to the bottling system and direct to some of the wholesale business. So again, we have freight. This is much, much more like the \u2013 much \u2013 and not like the rest of the world. This is very specific to the U.S. So that's where it comes in. Now I would just point out that we, in a way, have taken the more asset version of category price/mix, which is under the old accounting standards where it's a deduction from revenue. In 2018 and going forward, freight is actually in cost of goods and not reducing price/mix. So that is -- if we have taken it out, price/mix would have been better, but just to make it apples-to-apples and make it easier for people to understand, we left it under the old scheme, but it's worth about a point of price/mix, and it's going to start washing out by the time we get into the second half.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nBonnie Herzog: Alright, thank you. Good morning.\nJames Quincey: Good morning.\nKathy Waller: Good morning.\nBonnie Herzog: I wanted to actually circle back on your price/mix in North America, which was negative in the quarter and you touched on. But I guess, I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of your performance in the different channels. For instance, I'm wondering if the immediate consumption channel showed any signs of slowdown in the quarter. And then could you guys touch on pricing across different category clusters? It seems like you're getting healthy pricing in sparkling, driven by innovation and smaller packs, but maybe less so in other category clusters. So if you could touch on this, it would be helpful. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Yes, great. Look, in terms of the channels, I think, actually, volume was pretty broad based. I mean, we grew the bottle business grew, the fountain business grew. The Minute Maid business grew. The venturing and emerging brand business grew. All of them grew in volume terms. And so whether it was large grocery, convenience, QSR, I mean, the volume performance was broad based in terms of channels. It was broad based in terms of categories. Virtually, every category grew in volume terms. The one \u2013 the main one that didn't was juice, but that was actually a conscious decision to change the packaging size, to some extent, to downsize the packaging, given the pressure on juice COGS. And there we did see slightly less volume, but that was kind of a known part of the plan. So our broad-based volume in terms of channels, broad-based in terms of categories. And then pricing, as we talked about, the marketplace pricing looks good across the channels, and we have a clear expectation that our pricing strategy of creating value for our customers are capturing some of that ourselves by innovating in the marketing, innovating in the brands, in the categories, innovating in the package sizes will help to create value for everyone. And therefore, that's our strategy going forward in terms of our expectation for the year in terms of pricing. And we're going to continue to look for a way to earn price with our customers by doing the right things in the marketplace. And so, I think a continuation of what you've seen is what we're after.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nJames Quincey: Not, Ali? Hello?\nAli Dibadj: Can you here me?\nJames Quincey: Yes.\nAli Dibadj: Okay. So I'm still receiving lots of investor questions about price/mix in freight and the pendulum swing there. I'm not sure you're going to say more, so I have for you I kind of have questions instead. One is about the margin expansion to 600 basis points this quarter, which is obviously strong. Could you break that out in terms of how much was productivity versus how much was structural? It felt like most of it was structural and not a lot of product to be this quarter and what we should think about ramping that up for the rest of the year and ongoing? And then second question is around EMEA share. You only mentioned gaining share on juice, dairy and plant-based beverage clusters. And related to that, it looks like Turkey and South Africa were really good volumes; Nigeria and Western Europe not so great volumes. I don't think that's just a one quarter phenomenon. So how does that in particular inform your decision-making on CCBA and the bottlers who own those particular regions of Turkey, Western Europe, Nigeria as you think about your September kind of \u201cdeadline\u201d?\nJames Quincey: I think that looks like about four halves, Ali. There would you like us to focus if you don\u2019t want us to choose. Ali\u2026\nAli Dibadj: You can\u2019t answer this.\nKathy Waller: So I think we have answered the freight. I am not sure I can add much more on that one. Do you want to say something about the\u2026\nKathy Waller: Sure, on the operating margin, yeah. So the consolidated operating margin has increased of about 600 basis points. That is significantly structural, structural drove about 600 basis points. And then there is an \u2013 underlying business is positive, operating margin. And then that's offset a little bit by the mechanical impact of revenue recognition, which was about 100 basis points. So basically that's the drivers behind the operational \u2013 the operating margin...\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carline Leavy from Macquarie. Your line is now open.\nCarline Leavy: Thank you. Good morning. Can you here me?\nJames Quincey: Yes.\nKathy Waller: Yes.\nCarline Leavy: Great. My question goes around margins, but it's a longer-term question. As you see the growth in things like teas and other nonsparkling drinks, it just seems that investment cost is higher. Your market share comps dominant the way they are in carbonated soft drink. So how can one have confidence on the longer-term story that you get to your four thoughts hopefully revenue growth globally? Over time what drives margin improvements? It would be really helpful if you could, perhaps, walk us through some areas that could be the pluses or minuses?\nJames Quincey: Yes, okay. I think part of this -- market share is clearly important by category and not just by category obviously, that then is important whether it's in an average across the world or whether it's concentrated in the few places. So clearly, market share matters, and the quality of the leadership versus the rest of the competition also matters in terms of scale and margins check. We are managing a broad portfolio. There are -- and clearly, as we are in some of the more challenging and explorer situations by category and by country, yes, it does require more investments to make progress. But as I say that it's a portfolio effect, we have the task of managing the portfolio of where we\u2019ve clearly got quality and managing those places where we are investing to create more positions and leadership. And in a way as some of those graduating to leadership positions, we can cycle the investments into newer challenges and explore. So it's a portfolio management challenge. And even without having the same kind of shares on a global basis as we have in sparkling, there are places where we have got good positions in some category country combination, and they are able to achieve margins comparable with our sparkling business. So it's not leaving aside a couple of categories, which have inherently different economics and they tend to have high-dollar returns even if it's the percentages are lower like chilled juice and stuffs like that. The inherent economics of the different categories is possible to achieve attractive margins in each category if you can get to a quality leadership. So give an example, tea, which has done pretty well in a whole number of countries around the world and was getting \u2013 it wasn't requiring outsized investment and was trying to look better in terms of margin, we rolled that out across Europe this year. Yes, we've invested more money with it as we've got into the year. So clearly, investing more of a case if you like but more of a dollar of revenue than we are on the sparkling, but as we get that scale and we effectively double the value of the FUZE brand, we will be able to build the equity around the brand, can keep it relevant for consumers, keeping innovation going. Then that it will allow us to get the scale ultimately in the margin structure to make it comparable to sparkling. And of course, then, we will likely choose to reinvest in the next brand we're growing to make it simple.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Sharma from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nAmit Sharma: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nKathy Waller: Good morning.\nJames Quincey: Good morning.\nAmit Sharma: James, from all this discussion on pricing, can you just comment on how are you seeing it from consumer health and retailer perspective? Because your CPG peers on the food and HBC, they are not as confident of being able to get positive pricing, especially in North America. So can you just talk about like what you are seeing and how Coca-Cola and overall beverages are doing better than your CPG peers?\nJames Quincey: Yeah, a couple of thoughts, Amit. Firstly, beverages are growing faster than the average of consumer staples on a global basis. It's clearly one of the more attractive categories in total \u2013 the total consumer staples landscape, driven by the investments, driven by the innovation, driven by the marking, driven by the execution. Secondly, beverages are more diversified in terms of channels. So it's not all concentrated in one place. And especially ourselves, we have a global business that we're not \u2013 the things that are going on and things that we need to adapt to and evolve against. We are in over 200 countries and we're in over 20 channels. So we have a broad presence that that means we could adapt to changes in pressures in any one channel and in any one place without stabilizing all system, which then of course, goes back to one of the reasons why we are able to kind of mitigate some of these segments and remain an attractive, attractive category. Now having said that, we have to respond to the ongoing pressures in the marketplace. And just to kind of typify a couple of them, you've got consumers doing a number of things that you see happening in the channels are moving away from with the middle in a way. There are trends towards premiumization because, in a way, they're responding to trends around the types of ingredients that people want and the types of the manufacturing that tend to lead to more of a premium product, premium packaging, but there are also people looking for value. And beverages and what we can do with products and packaging allows us to offer \u2013 to create offerings across a broad spectrum and really provide that choice in each channel and for every channel, and I think that's what's allowing us to do a bit better.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein from Evercore. Your line is now open.\nTheo Brito: This is Theo Brito for Robert. I am wondering if you could give us some more details on the growth in China this quarter. I think you said volumes are up over 20%. Wondering how much of that was a benefit from timing of Chinese New Year or, perhaps, a renewed kind of accelerated growth and new trajectory for your business there. Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. China had a good quarter. And clearly, some of it was the Chinese New Year was more fully in this quarter than the previous quarter. Secondly, the 20% I mentioned was brand Coke, not the total business, actually the total business was slightly less because we made some decisions around some of our low-value water to back off on some of those. So we actually sold a little less water than we, perhaps, we did last year. But that was a clear decision to go for building consumer franchise and value. Net-net, we're doing better in China. We've got some more effective brand communication. As I talked about, we've got some innovative digital campaigns. We've got some packaging innovations and premium offers around sleek cans and some value offers. And newly refranchised bottlers are taking that expanded portfolio. And really, Costco and Swire are really working well with some of the key channels to drive the business in China. So it's been a strategy that's been in implementation for a while. And we are starting to see the benefits come through again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you, and good morning. James, if I want to go back to the Latin American question from Judy, you have been having obviously an impressive balance in Brazil. It sounds in the mid-single-digits and after two years of declines a similar CAGR. So I was hoping if you can elaborate more on pricing mix in Lat Am on an environment of low inflation, as Kathy highlighted. So in other words, if your price/ mix was up by 6% in the region, but mostly \u2013 if it was mostly driven by Mexico, so I'm assuming price/mix is still negative in Brazil because of returnables and affordable juices. So in other words, are you starting to see a lift and shift in Brazil in mix, in particular, in the new high-end juice launches as well as Coke Zero? So \u2013 or in other words are you betting that consumers will take longer to premiumize again after two recession years? Or should we think of Brazil more of an offset of the decelerating trends in Mexico? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Look, I think a few thoughts on Latin America. There are a number of things that are happening here at the same time. One, the macros are improving in Brazil and Argentina in terms of GDP, but that's coming with slightly less inflation, perhaps in Mexico, it\u2019s being a bit of a softening at the back end of last year and into this year. So it's one, the macro environment is important. Two, we are seeing less inflation. I wouldn't say there's low inflation. Inflation in Latin America continues to be above the U.S., for example, and many of the other developed countries. So it's not that we've gone from inflation to low inflation. It's still pretty medium, the inflation. You are seeing Brazil perform a little better. That was the packaging strategy around returnables. And I think, ultimately, this is all netting out in more dollars because, along with moderating inflation is less losses on the foreign exchange, I know we came to talk about currency-neutral numbers, but in the end to generate the dollars, what's also important to us is some of the FX rates are not as negative in Latin America. So I think, I mean, you can \u2013 came in the team and get into more detail on Latin America, but it's really the sum of lots of moving parts here and driving forward. But net-net, the teams in Latin America, the bottlers in Latin America are using the broad portfolio, a lot of thinking around packaged price architects to adapt to the changes in the marketplace, the changes in the consumer and the changes in the channels. And I think we started to see more benefits of that coming through, not just in kind of currency-neutral, but also in money.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Bill Chappell from SunTrust. Your line is open.\nBill Chappell: Thanks, good morning.\nKathy Waller: Good morning.\nBill Chappell: Hey, just I want to actually go back to costs. A year ago, I think you know announced the expansion of the productivity and reinvestment program. Now I would there've been a fair amount of headcount reductions middle and late last year, but it sounds like there was kind of continue to fine tuning early this year. So maybe just an update on the program if you found more savings, if \u2013 how much we\u2019re already seeing in the current numbers and how much we expect to see this year?\nKathy Waller: Okay, hi, Bill. What you saw earlier this year was discontinuation of our lean enterprise initiative. So North America was the primary driver of the decimal headcount reduction that happened in the \u2013 or happening in the first quarter. So productivity, we are on track to do the total $3.8 billion by 2019, which includes additional $800 million that you referred to. And again, the initiatives are kind of in line and we are on track.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Okay. Thank you very much everyone. To conclude, we had a solid start to the year. We capitalized on our momentum coming out of 2017, and we will continue to drive our strategy through the remainder of the year. And we absolutely remain confident we will deliver our full year guidance. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and thank you for joining us.\nOperator: And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

We delivered on our financial commitments for the year even in the face of stronger than expected currency headwinds. We see the right strategy taking hold, supported by the right partners underpinned by a growing and vibrant industry, but we\u2019re just getting started. This is what gives us confidence in our 2020 outlook and we are optimistic about the long-term opportunities in front of us. As we got to 2019, our business performed well. We gained value share globally in addition to gaining share in each of our geographic segments achieving our largest share gain in almost a decade with 34 of our top 40 markets gaining share. Organic revenue grew 6%, two points ahead of our initial forecast and at the top end of our long-term growth model. Top line growth was driven by strength across all the operating segments. Comparable currency neutral operating income grew 13% versus our initial goal of 10% to 11% through accelerated top line growth and delivering on our productivity targets. Comparable EPS grew 1% at the top end of our guidance despite a higher than expected eight-point currency headwind. Finally, we delivered $10.5 billion in cash from operations, up 37% for prior year and well ahead of our initial guidance. Our 2019 performance was the result of a broad-based success across the majority of our markets. Globally, we achieved high-single digit organic revenue growth within our developing and emerging markets along with mid-single digit organic revenue growth in our developed markets. So let me walk you around the world a little and touch on some of the strategic actions that we have been taking. In North America, we delivered a solid performance in 2019 and we are well positioned with a strong marketing and innovation pipeline heading into 2020. Organic revenue grew 3% for the year, and while we continue to gain overall value share too, trademark Coca-Cola drove our performance with 4% retail value growth. Volumes in trademark Coke were positive for the second consecutive year even as we continue to execute on our smaller pack initiatives. Across our refranchise North American bottling system, there is improved execution and continued conviction about the long-term growth opportunities for our business. Over the past few years, the system has invested nearly three quarters of the $1 billion to support our innovation and revenue growth management agenda. This includes expanding availability of our popular mini cans which again grew in the double digits for the year. Turning to Latin America. Here we achieved 13% organic revenue growth while navigating a tough macro environment by focusing on the fundamentals. These included expanding cooler placements, acceleration of single-serve packs and increasing availability of returnable packaging in under-indexed markets. For example, in Brazil, we delivered the best performance we\u2019ve seen in seven years growing more than twice the rate of consumer spending. Our results were driven by high-single digit growth of single-serve packages, due in part to a more than 20% increase in cooler placements by our volume partners. This aligned focus and investment is a testament to the long-term opportunities our system sees in the large and important market. The resilience of our Brazilian business helped deliver solid results in Latin America despite markets such as Argentina where the economic situation continued to deteriorate during the year. In EMEA, organic revenue growth of 5% was balanced between solid industry growth and strong share gains. Growth was driven by strong results across developed, developing and emerging markets, while innovations with Coca-Cola led to the best performance we\u2019ve seen in the last eight years for the trademark. Our innovation with iconic brands also went beyond trademark Coca-Cola. Schweppes grew double digits during the year, boosted by our new adult/mixer offerings. Fuze Tea continued to perform well across the group, now fully lapping its 37 market rollout in January of 2018. We have strong plans in place for the brand heading into 2020 focused on new winter flavors and no sugar antioxidant-infused offerings. These results led to the strongest share gains we\u2019ve seen in years across the region supported both by sparkling and non-sparkling gains. Turning to Asia. A concerted effort to recruit new consumers and drive horizontal expansion helped deliver 5% organic revenue growth for the year. Across Asia we added 1.4 million new customer outlets, led by our two largest markets in the region; China and India. Our success in China is not just solely based on increased distribution. In order to help expand the consumer base, we've been adapting to the new digital-first consumer landscape. For example, we launched an integrated Coke and meal campaign with a heavy focus on online food aggregators. This helped us recruit more than 20 million new consumers boosting our share of online meal ordering to over 60%. Actions like these led us to be named the fastest growing FMCG brand in Asia by Kantar. I\u2019ve also been encouraged by the system's response in markets where we face challenges. In Japan, for example, the system moved quickly to rebuild production capacity following natural disasters in 2018 and stepped up execution performance in order to support our innovation pipeline. Across the globe, we\u2019ve seen that a constant focus on innovation, revenue growth management and improved execution, all supported by integrated brand building forms the foundation to deliver strong results today and in the years ahead. Although we have much room to improve, I'm pleased with the progress we've made across these areas during the year. On innovation, we\u2019ve leveraged the strength of our flagship brand while continuing to innovate across the total portfolio. Coke with Coffee launched in 35 additional markets in 2019 is satisfying a new occasion and recruiting consumers back into the brand driving incremental sales to the Coca-Cola trademark. We\u2019ve also launched Coke Energy in select international markets. And while we\u2019ve seen some success with initial rollout, we\u2019ll continue to learn how to enhance the consumer proposition as we expand further into 2020, including our recent rollout in the U.S. that tastes a little more like Coke. We\u2019re putting the full marketing muscle behind out Coke Energy launch in the U.S. Turning to the juice, dairy and plant-based portfolio. NUTRIBOOST continues to grow strongly across Asia, behind our new and innovative functional dairy products for kids and young adults. NUTRIBOOST started as an internal innovation in Vietnam and continues to expand across the region, including its latest launch in Australia. We look to continue accelerating our innovation pipeline in 2020. And just touching on North America, our innovation plans includes the launch of a half sparkling water in March with a distinctive edge in the sparkling water space as two flavor offerings contain caffeine for a little morning or afternoon pick me up. We're innovating within our sports drink portfolio as well with the rollout of Powerade Ultra, a breakthrough innovation for the sports drink category with cutting-edge ingredients, including creatine and more electrolytes than original Powerade. We\u2019re also expanding our capabilities through the recent acquisition of fairlife, giving us a strong position in the fast-growing value-added dairy space. We\u2019ve also taken several steps in the ongoing evolution of our revenue growth management agenda. We're strengthening our competitive advantage by making better, more informed decisions and making them faster, translating data into insights and insights into actions. Importantly, these insights equip our customers with a new view on how to create value in the beverage category, one not dependent on lowering prices to drive foot traffic. For example, working with one of our European bottling partners we added an incremental 100,000 transactions per week for one of our largest customers through insights driven by our RGM capabilities. This kind of collaboration helped to drive results, leveraging the power of our consumer insights to support growth for us, our bottling partners and our customers. It's another example of how we create shared value for all who touch the Coca-Cola business. And we\u2019re still in the early stages of building out these capabilities and see this as a source of growth for a long time to come. In the end, ultimately though, it comes down to execution as you can have a fantastic brand, a compelling consumer proposition but it must be available at the right place at the right time. And execution continues to be based on the fundamentals. For example, in the Philippines, through the placement of more than 10,000 coolers and a 23 point increase in order fulfillment rates, we achieved double-digit volume growth for the year along with our highest availability coverage and market share in seven years. To support our growth agenda, we\u2019ve always been clear that M&A serves as an enabler to our strategy rather than a strategy in of itself. During 2019, we acquired Costa coffee which provides us a platform to create a world-class global coffee business. And we\u2019re moving with speed to build a strong foundation for long-term value creation under that brand. We started with the launch of ready-to-drink Costa across Europe, already achieving six points of value share in GB within the category. We\u2019ve also accelerated placements of Costa Express at premium self-serve coffee solutions including more than 700 units across key markets in the fourth quarter alone. And we\u2019re working closely with our bottling partners to accelerate the total cost of platform in 2020. While I\u2019m proud of our team in delivering strong results, I\u2019m equally proud of the work we are doing to build a sustainable business for the future. Our initiatives address water stewardship, sugar reduction, women\u2019s empowerment and climate, but I\u2019ll focus here on our World Without Waste initiative, which includes a number of goals to reduce packaging waste. We\u2019ve made steady progress. For example, bottles made with 100% recycled PET are now available in 12 markets with more planned for 2020. Coca-Cola Sweden announced it would be the first market in the world to transition to 100% rPET, 100% recycled PET, for all plastic bottles made in the country, a fully circular economy. In 2019, in Western Europe, we used nearly 30% recycled plastic across our total portfolio of PET bottles and are accelerating fast in line with supply. By the end of the year, we project to reach 40% recycled plastics in our bottles in Western Europe targeting 50% by 2023 and working to increase the recycled content steadily thereafter. Within our flagship U.S. market, we teamed with partners and large competitors to launch Every Bottle Back program, which is designed to improve sorting, processing and collection in areas with the biggest infrastructure gaps. This will help increase the amount of recycled plastic available to be remade into beverage bottles. Speaking more broadly, we are preparing our system for the future with a flexible packaging portfolio. We are investing in innovation to design-in sustainable solutions and design-out waste, while also reducing our carbon footprint in line with our science-based targets. We\u2019re also maintaining a portfolio of aluminum and glass packaging and creating package-less solutions like Freestyle and DASANI PureFill to provide more choice. As we look forward, I\u2019m encouraged by the progress the organization is making, progress that gives us confidence in delivering consistent and sustainable financial performance. It\u2019s clear that our culture shift is gaining traction as we continue to raise the performance bar across the organization. Looking at the bigger picture, our success comes down to our ability to craft the beverage brands that people love and refresh them in body and spirit. We strive to do this in ways that create a more sustainable business and a better shared future that makes a difference in people\u2019s lives, communities and our planet. Simply put, it\u2019s about love brands done sustainably for a better shared future. And I look forward to sharing more with you at upcoming CAGNY. So with that, I\u2019m going to turn over to John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and thank you to everybody for joining us this morning. As James mentioned, 2019 was another solid year. We delivered on our financial commitments while continuing to invest for growth in the years ahead. Our press release covered our fourth quarter results in detail. Big picture, we saw another quarter of solid results with 7% top line growth translating into double-digit operating income growth. When you factor in timing of shipments and the extra day in the quarter, the top line is closer to a 6% net of these factors and in line with our full year top line results. With that, I will focus on some of the progress we\u2019ve been making on our priorities as well as on our 2020 guidance. On the top line, we continue to see a strong response from the strategic actions we\u2019ve been taking now in the second year of delivering at the mid-to-high end of our long-term growth algorithm with contribution from both volume and price mix. Delivering quality top line growth is translating into underlying margin expansion and profit growth. For 2019, we achieved underlying operating margin expansion of 150 basis points driven by top line acceleration and leveraging our cost base through productivity initiatives. We expanded margins even as we accelerate reinvestments in the business helping us to drive double-digit profit growth on a currency neutral basis. Comparable operating margin compressed by approximately 100 basis points as underlying expansion was more than offset by a combined approximate 250 basis point headwind from currency and acquisitions. Free cash flow has been a particular area of focus this past year, enabling us to deliver $8.4 billion during the year, up 38% from the prior year and well ahead of our plan. We achieved this through accelerating our underlying performance, capturing working capital initiatives, a reduction in productivity and reinvestment costs and more disciplined use of our capital spend. Our progress on cash is a good example of when the organization was clear on the opportunity and the drivers to achieve this. And as we\u2019ve seen, the results can sometimes exceed even our own expectations. Turning to the 2020 outlook, based on the progress we\u2019ve been making and the plans we have in place, we expect to achieve results well within our long-term growth targets for revenue, profit and earnings per share for 2020. Importantly, we expect to deliver meaningful U.S. dollar EPS growth. Specifically, we expect organic revenue growth of approximately 5% and comparable currency neutral operating income growth of approximately 8%. Key drivers of our operational outlook center around our continued focus on innovation, revenue growth management and improved execution, all supported by a comprehensive approach to brand building. James highlighted a few aspects of the innovation pipeline and we continue to get sharper on how to better connect our revenue growth plan with initiatives into an integrated execution strategy in the marketplace that delivers on both the top and the bottom line. From a macro perspective, although volatility remains in certain spots around the world, we do expect consumer spending to remain healthy for 2020 and expect the emerging and developing world to outpace developed markets similar to 2019. In terms of currency based on the latest rates, our hedged positions and our forecasted business mix, we anticipate a zero to one point headwind at revenue and a two to three point headwind at operating income. These headwinds are inclusive of cycling any hedging gains in 2019, which as noted in the past were minimum. Considering these factors, we expect comparable earnings per share of approximately $2.25 for 2020, a 7% increase from the prior year. We also expect to generate approximately $8 billion of free cash flow for 2020 through $10 billion in cash from operations and $2 billion in capital investments. Cash generation will be driven by continued strong underlying performance, capturing further working capital benefits, further reduction in productivity and reinvestment costs and even more disciplined use of capital spend. We remain consistent on our disciplined capital allocation program which balances financial flexibility with efficient capital structure. Specifically, we\u2019ll continue to reinvest the cash generated to support our growth agenda. We\u2019ll also continue to return cash to shareholders by growing the dividend. And after investing for growth and delivering on our dividend commitments, we intend to use the excess cash to repurchase shares over time. My last point to cover is timing considerations for our 2020 outlook, as we expect the majority of growth to occur in the back half of the year. The two biggest factors are; first, we have one less day in the first quarter and two additional days in the fourth quarter. And second, we will be cycling the impact from our European bottlers increasing their safety stocks in advance of a potentially disruptive Brexit earlier in 2019. This was a benefit to revenue growth in the first quarter of 2019 and then was subsequently reversed in the fourth quarter. The cycling effect will create a natural headwind for the first quarter of 2020 and a headwind in the fourth quarter. So in summary, we are pleased with our 2019 results and confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments for 2020. We\u2019re also very clear on the direction we're heading as a system and well equipped to execute on the strategies to get us there. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nJames Quincey: Good morning.\nJohn Murphy: Good morning.\nDara Mohsenian: Just wanted to touch on the organic sales growth guidance for 2020. You obviously posted a strong 6% result in 2019, but your guidance does imply a bit of a slowdown in 2020. So just wanted to hear if anything is giving you specific concern there driving that slowdown, maybe an update on emerging markets and anything you\u2019re seeing there or is that guidance more that you typically start the year assuming some things will go wrong and with a bit of a conservative bend similar to 2019? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Thanks. I think the first fundamental point to make is we don\u2019t see any change in our underlying business momentum. As we consider the global macros and the geopolitics and the wins that could buffer things, we\u2019ve got really focused on what we can control and what we can drive and really putting together a program around the brand building, the innovation, the revenue growth management and the execution. That\u2019s served us well in 2019 and we believe it will serve us well in 2020. So we\u2019re expecting a solid result in 2020. There were a few puts and takes in 2019 that perhaps favor the result a little. The contribution from BIG which obviously is a little more disproportionately contributing on the revenue versus the profit line. So we feel that as we look out into 2020, we\u2019re seeing the same momentum, the same levers we know how to pull. And when you compare it backwards to kind of a two-year run rate or make a small adjustment for BIG, I think you\u2019d see it\u2019s very much in line with what we\u2019re delivering. Of course, if we do better in the year, we\u2019ll update guidance as and when that becomes appropriate. But we think we got a great plan, we\u2019ve got solid momentum, 10 quarters of doing in the range and I think that\u2019s how you should think about 2020.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nSteve Powers: Great. Thanks. Maybe just sticking with the top line, 2019 was a great year on organic growth as you just described but particularly in terms of price/mix realization. I guess the question is, is there a way to parse out how much of the five points of price mix you realized in '19 was driven by initiatives that you would see as real and repeatable versus things that might be considered more one-time step-ups or pricing simply as a byproduct of outsize inflation in certain emerging markets? And I guess more importantly as you think about the composition of growth in 2020, do you expect a similar price/mix versus volume composition or is it to be more balanced as we look forward?\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Steve. Look, lots of moving pieces as one looks at the aggregate price/mix ratio. Obviously 2019 was a little heavier around price/mix. I think there was some inflation coming through places like Argentina. We\u2019ve certainly talked about previously how we\u2019re looking for a balance between volume and price over time as you get up into the 5% to 6% growth; 6 last year, 5 the year before, looking for 5. We\u2019re looking for 2 to 3 of each. So clearly 5 would be more than we would imagine is the long term. But we\u2019re going to focus on what drives the core business. The way I think about pricing is that pricing has to be earned, it has to be earned with the consumer, it has to be earned with the customer because they want their business to grow. So it\u2019s about the brand building, it\u2019s about the innovation, it\u2019s about the RGM initiatives. We\u2019ve talked on previous calls about how we see that as a long runway of opportunity on RGM on the pricing and the packaging opportunities and of course executing it. And just final thought is in 2019, the price/mix is a little over weighted by what happened with BIG being very strong as well. So we\u2019ll continue to push to earn pricing and we\u2019ll be looking going forward for a balance between price/mix and volume.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nAli Dibadj: Hi, guys.\nJames Quincey: Hi, Ali.\nAli Dibadj: I think that despite just the first two questions you got, it feels like investors seem to may be moved on a little bit from questioning too much at least your organic top line growth sustainability. I hope that\u2019s true. I hope that\u2019s right. But we are certainly kind of keep looking for your top line to show leverage on your EPS line and that seems to be a little bit more elusive. I want your perspective on that. 2020 guidance that you\u2019ve given, obviously 5% organic top line growth, that\u2019s only 7% EPS growth. For a lot of other companies that would be much higher than that in the FMCG world. And I love your perspective on why that is for you guys in particular whether that can change, and in particular why not get more leverage out of being more decisive on your share buyback at this point especially, John, to your point given how free cash flow is improving. Why not do something more now?\nJames Quincey: Well, firstly, I think our long-term growth model is pretty clear. And the revenue guidance for 2020 is in the middle of the range and the operating income guidance is in the middle of the range and yet we\u2019re still projecting at this point in time a mild currency headwind which then gives us the 7 on EPS. So I think the key is to keep looking at the underlying performance of the business in currency neutral and there\u2019s good leverage built in there, and we\u2019ve certainly benefitted over the last number of years from a lot of leverage for having coming out of refranchising having focused on productivity, having used innovation to give us leverage between revenue and operating income. We see ourselves entering a more steady phase where there is continued leverage from revenue to operating income, in this case three points in the guidance for 2020 and it\u2019s partly being driven by productivity and partly being driven by innovation and revenue growth management. So I think those should be the stable outlook going forward having come off a very strong period of getting operating leverage. Do you want to say anything about earnings, John?\nJohn Murphy: Yes, let me just add a point on the EPS on the share buybacks. We\u2019ve got to look at it in the context of two areas. One is our overall capital allocation priorities. And then secondly, the cash we have available at a given point in time. So with respect to capital allocation priorities, I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent that priority number one is to invest in the business; number two, to grow the dividend; number three, to look at opportunistic M&A. And then number four is to look at share repurchase. That has to be in the context of cash we have available. And while our free cash flow progress in 2019 was terrific, I think when you take a step back and look at the cash we have available, last year and even this year we\u2019re talking about a relatively small amount. So we\u2019ll continue to factor that into our decision making as we go through 2020 and into 2021.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I just had two questions. First on, I just wanted to talk a little bit about cash because the cash conversion was a pretty dramatic change, I think 96% by my math, and I know working capital benefits probably helped a little bit with that, but the guidance is still really strong for next year. So if you can just talk a little bit about how you\u2019ve driven such a big step change in performance on that front and speak a bit to sustainability? And then, James, you gave a lot of color on plastic and I just have been thinking a lot about on the consumer awareness and preference changes and how quickly that seems to be building momentum, particularly in the U.S. So if you could just offer a perspective on how as a system you can sort of balance dealing with that, the consumer interest but also the cost that\u2019s implied in sort of changing that packaging mix? Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Lauren, and your math is pretty accurate, so hold on. I think I\u2019ve been pretty consistent in the last year talking about this as being a top priority for me and at least for the team. We\u2019re very clear on the drivers to improve our free cash flow. I have a great team in place and frankly speaking the only surprise was that they made progress as fast as they have hitting it out of the park especially in the fourth quarter. As I look to the sustainability going forward, I see continued opportunities to improve the underlying fundamentals. Cash from operations should continue to improve. We\u2019ve still got opportunities on working capital. We\u2019re not seeing much benefit in the comparative years on CapEx but over time that will be there. And we will have lower sort of transformation costs in the productivity arena particularly. For 2020, we do need to factor in a couple of special items. There is recycling of a special dividend from 2019 and some transition tax payments. On a two-year basis if you look at it, we\u2019re in the mid-to-high 80s and I expect us to continue to make progress upwards from there. So, yes, good progress and still a lot of opportunity ahead.\nJames Quincey: Perhaps we\u2019ll be such generous [ph] into two questions as we kind of did two of Ali. On the plastics bit, Lauren, clearly consumer awareness is going on plastics in particular and packaging or consumer waste in general. For sure, it\u2019s going up U.S. and perhaps even further ahead places in Europe. So check, awareness is going up. Second thing that\u2019s happening is I think the emergence of a more profound investigation of what does it really mean. Certainly sometimes initially there\u2019s a danger, it becomes a philosophical question of plastic good or plastic bad whereas actually when you get into it, the first thing to realize is there are different types of plastics and some plastics have high value and are easily made part of the circular economy. Some have a very hard recycle and have very little value and then there\u2019s stuff in the middle. So what\u2019s happening now is that a kind of a more structured move towards, okay, what can we really do about it? And what happens is two objectives come together when stand back from plastic. And actually it then applies to plastic, aluminum, glass, cardboard, whatever packaging material they\u2019re talking about, two things comes together. How do we have zero waste and how in doing that do we have the lowest possible carbon footprint, because that\u2019s the other objective that\u2019s going to come back into the equation here. I think the plastics space started more on the waste side, but the two things are going to come together and the objectives are going to end up being how do we design a system that deliver the brands and beverages that people want with zero waste and a lower carbon footprint. And when you go down that road and you get into plastics, for example as a material, what you find is high-value plastics in which PET bottles are the preeminent high-value plastic. If you can get them back, they\u2019re fully recycled and fully reusable in beverage bottles, as we pointed out, we can have our first mark in the world, we\u2019re going to achieve a circular economy of getting the bottles back and making them back into plastic bottles, a fully circular economy in Sweden with our bottles and those recycled PET bottles have a lower carbon footprint than just one-way plastic bottles but also have a lower carbon footprint than cans or glass at least on today\u2019s technology. So actually if your objectives remain zero waste and lower carbon footprint, which is where I believe the conversation is going to move towards, then achieving a circular economy on PET is actually the best way to achieve that objective. Now there are as I said other types of plastic and we as a system have gone through the process of \u2013 the bottle has lots of value. There are other plastics we use like shrink wraps which don\u2019t \u2013 are much harder to recycle or have low value. So, for example, our Western European bottler is just going through a process of investing under the European single-use plastic directive to removal of that plastic on the supply chain and putting in cardboard. It cost a little bit more, but it can be accommodated within the business system. So we\u2019re starting to work on how do we eliminate low-value, super hard to recycle plastics? And then the bit in the middle, we\u2019re investing with companies \u2013 other people are doing it too \u2013 on innovation. Because what\u2019s needed there is some new technologies, enhanced recycling. We came out with an innovation last year. We call it the marine where we were able to take very dirty PET which doesn\u2019t fit in the normal stream, actually with enhanced recycling, chemical recycling, we\u2019re able to turn that back into food-grade PET. So I see the circular economy on clean PET bottles being the lowest carbon footprint and zero waste and that\u2019s the solution for today. New technologies coming in for the middle types of plastics will kind of complete the circular economy play and the system moving out of hard to recycle glasses. Now all of that if we do it collectively with peer manufacturers in beverages and other FMCG and retailers and put in place with governments the lowest cost collection of systems possible, this can all be accommodated within the business system going forward. And therefore we can continue to use a range of packaging vehicles for the consumer not forgetting that we are also one of the largest enterprises that have package-less dispensing between our fountain business, our Freestyle business, our Costa Express business, we provide a wide platform of bottle or can-less dispensing of beverages. And we\u2019re continuing to innovate with DASANI PureFill. So we will run a dual track system and make sure we can offer the consumer the beverages they want and achieve a future where we have zero waste and a lower carbon footprint.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much and congratulations on a strong quarter capping an excellent year. James, when you came onboard, you talked about changing the culture, trying to drive more agility, speed, accountability and certainly we\u2019re seeing strong results. But I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the cultural changes that you\u2019re actually doing, kind of the sustainability of that, perhaps have you adapted the compensation system? And then maybe also touch on the changes that you did initially, you went from a CMO to a growth officer, now you\u2019ve gone back; maybe a little bit around that decision and how that works into your overall objectives? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Let me start with the culture piece and then come to the CMO piece. Absolutely what we said on the culture and simply put around really fundamentally driving a growth mindset and celebrating all that\u2019s great about the Coke culture and the Coke system culture to get us more growth oriented. And as I\u2019ve said before, any large system, particularly a large successful system is predestined in a way to the effects of gravity to suck focus inwards the bigger and bigger it gets and the more successful it gets. And so it has to be pushed against the drive and external view what is the consumer doing, what do they really want, how are we going to help our customers grow the business? Without that, things will go wrong. And so that\u2019s been the focus of the culture shift to really drive that. It then goes along with the organizational strategy around empowerment and accountability and backing it up with compensation. I don\u2019t think we should lose sight of the fact that cash got included in the compensation in the last couple of years and we have done somewhat better in 2019 on cash. So it is about an organizational strategy, the various components working together to drive the end results which is about the growth mindset leads to a focus on growth which leads to better results. And as we think about that, switching over to the CMO question, we put in place the growth office with the purpose of providing more structure. We had spent a number of years expanding the portfolio into different categories with different brands we had not been disciplined enough about working out which ones were truly brands that offer the consumer compelling proposition and which were just bulking up. And we had to come in and be more disciplined. So the work that the growth office did with Francisco driving it to create the leader, challenger, explorer and the zombies and really get clear about what\u2019s working, what\u2019s not working and how do we administer structure to the portfolio in a more strategic way was a critical piece of getting more organized over the last couple of years. And now the next phase which is kind of why we\u2019ve gone back to more of a Chief Market Officer structure is having put that strategic logic in place, we have to continue to excel on one of the four fundamental levers of the business. We talk about brand building, innovation, RGM and execution, having a sharper focus on the hard core of marketing is critical. Now we have a clear structure on how we want to approach the portfolio.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi, Good morning, everybody. You\u2019re growing more quickly than you have in quite some time, including in volumes terms, and it sounds like the spread or the mix between volume and price may skew a bit to volume next year. It also sounds like there\u2019s a lot of \u2013 there\u2019s quite tight cans capacity at the moment. Is there any risk that there could be a limit or lid on your growth because of lack of access to cans?\nJames Quincey: At the moment we don\u2019t see any problem accessing can capacity given our current plans. Obviously we have a global procurement team that works on buying aluminum and can capacity for us and we believe we have good visibility into what we need going forward. I know there\u2019s some thinking out there that if plastics come under pressure, then can is suddenly going to shoot up. Our cans are doing well. Certainly, we are going to continue with our strategy of driving the mini cans which has been a strong piece of the North American success. So there\u2019s going to be innovation in cans, there\u2019s going to be more growth in cans, but we don\u2019t see the market becoming widely un-stabilized. And so we believe we have all the canning capacity with our supply base to drive the growth that we need.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. So, James, you mentioned that you\u2019re putting the full Coke marketing force behind Coke Energy. And I know it\u2019s too early, but how has the launch gone go far? And what does the incremental shelf space come from \u2013 I mean where is \u2013 coming from the energy cooler? And what have you learned about shelf placement in the other parts of the world that you\u2019re applying to the U.S.? And if you\u2019re generous also with me, can you please break down the 17% price/mix in LatAm into list price, Argentina benefit and better mix of single serve that you called out in Brazil and Mexico and how should we think about the region embedded in your 5% guidance globally? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Okay. Maybe I\u2019ll start with Latin America and exude generosity through the whole call. Argentina I think accounted for about three points of extra inflationary pricing within the Latin America number. So that would give you something in the kind of low teens for Latin America for the full year if you excluded Argentina and I think that\u2019s more consistent with what you see going backwards in time for price mix for Argentina. We don\u2019t break out the kind of single serve in Brazil and the other pieces. So I think if you believe that Argentina inflation is going to come down, then taking \u2013 seeing Latin America\u2019s price/mix go back or exclude that benefit would then be logical. In terms of Coke Energy, we\u2019re certainly making a strong effort in North America. It\u2019s kind of version 2.0 having done a 1.0 in a number of the international markets. And one of the things we learnt as we went into North America market is we wanted to move the flavor profile of the product closer to Coke, less citrusy, more Coke like. We think that\u2019s going to work well for the North America market and we\u2019ll be rolling that formula out in some of the round-one marketplaces. Certainly in terms of shelf space and execution into customers, we\u2019re very clear and we\u2019re looking to take space from the energy category from brands that are competitive to those carried by the Coke system, by which I mean I also include monitoring that among the Coke system. So we\u2019re looking to take from other competitors and generate space. So the strategy is clear. We\u2019re looking to expand the access to the energy category and we think Coke can do that. We\u2019re certainly giving it a go. And as you said, it\u2019s very early days and so we don\u2019t have any clear conclusions yet in the U.S. marketplace, but it certainly seems to have generated a lot of interest.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is now open.\nBill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning.\nJames Quincey: Good morning.\nBill Chappell: Can you just \u2013 I realize it\u2019s still early, but any kind of thoughts of how coronavirus changes your plans in China, be it just current sales or plans to rollout Costa? And also maybe any update or reminder of kind of what SARS did to numbers, if anything, 10 years ago or 15 years ago?\nJames Quincey: Sure. Well, starting at the end, obviously China\u2019s economy was in a different place when SARS happened almost 10, 15 years ago. Net-net when seen on an annual basis, the effect was not particularly noticeable from a business point of view. Obviously, the human and health point of view is different, but from a business point of view SARS did not ultimately seem to make that much difference. It\u2019s worth noting the Chinese economy is much bigger and this could become more connected to the rest of the world. China accounts about 10% of our global volume, less on a profit and revenue basis but about 10% of our global volume. It is early days. Our focus is firstly our employees\u2019 safety. Secondly, to support efforts the Chinese government wants in accommodating what needs to be accommodated to help them deal with the crisis, whether that\u2019s making donations of product or money to help in the efforts which we\u2019ve already done through the Coke Foundation, through the Coke system and through donation of product. And then thirdly, to worry about business continuity and recoverability or recoverability and then continuity. So far, of course, the short-term effects are the offices are closed, a good number of the factories are closed and so that\u2019s the current situation. There will be \u2013 there is an effort by of course the Chinese government there still has to be food and beverage available for the population, so we under the auspices of the Chinese government and their kind of crisis management reopening some of our manufacturing facilities to make sure we continue to produce our product for the population and get it distributed in a way that\u2019s not going to make the spread \u2013 be part of the spread. So it\u2019s way too early to tell what the impact in the short term is. And I think ultimately in the long run it will rebalance, as I said, number one priority is employee safety; number two is help support the efforts to contain the virus and manage the crisis; number three, ensure business can be recovered and to support continuity in the short term.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.\nLaurent Grandet: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I do have a question regarding the cash flow trend. So clearly strong progress this year which should be a positive for many investors. Now you mentioned in the past you were going through a task of identifying the right size of ownership level of your bottling partners. Could you please update us on that task specifically? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yes. We talked about that in the past in the context of looking at our overall balance sheet and making sure that we are fully utilizing our asset base in the most efficient and effective manner. We continue to look at all aspects of the balance sheet, including our equity investments. It\u2019s a thoughtful process. It requires us to work closely with our partners which we are doing. We\u2019ve had a couple of initiatives in 2019 that you\u2019re aware of and we\u2019ve continued to do what\u2019s right for both our balance sheet but also for the businesses that we\u2019re invested in. Overall, it\u2019s not a material matter when it comes to our future cash flow trends and we\u2019ll continue to update you as we make progress.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Carlos Laboy with HSBC. Your line is now open.\nCarlos Laboy: Good morning, everyone. On price/mix, can you comment on the roll of bottler digital platform advances for driving things like directive initiatives by point of sale? Where do you see the system advancing these digital capabilities further as you look out to 2020, 2021, and how important do you think these are as you look ahead?\nJames Quincey: Sure. The ability to drive RGM absolutely can be made more powerful and to some extent will have a greater reliance on our ability to capture, use analytics to generate the insights for the further round, not just the overall aggregate price packaging but ability to work with customers kind of one-on-one in a segmented way to drive results. So no question that the increasing availability and generalability, if I can just invent that word, of data is going to create a competitive advantage for the Coke system for the bottlers to be able to drive revenue growth management and engage with customers on how to drive it. And then ultimately at some point that will bring in AI and all sorts of other tools, but I see that as all under version 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 of driving RGM and then RGM is a competitive advantage for the Coke bottlers and the Coke system overall.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Sean King with UBS. Your line is now open.\nSean King: Hi. Good morning. How are you thinking about the margin impact of the innovation pipeline you have planned for the U.S. in 2020? I guess I\u2019m thinking in particular about Coke Energy. And in that light, any insight you can provide on the pricing and promotional strategy for the rollout of those different products would be great?\nJohn Murphy: Not a lot of news on that. I think the margin impact for both energy and AHA should be overall very positive. I think what we need to most is take a look at the overall innovation pipeline. It links back to what James referred to earlier. It is one of the key drivers of both sustainable top line growth and then also conversion into the kind of margin expansion that we\u2019re committed to for the future. I think with the shift from being volume centric to value centric, we\u2019ve seen our business units at our R&D centers readjust their focus on making sure that what comes out of the pipeline on an overall basis has got the right margin characteristic. So a lot of good work underway and I think we\u2019re \u2013 you\u2019ll see that being reflected in the overall output from innovation not just in North America but in the rest of the world.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nKevin Grundy: Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on a strong year. John, I wanted to come back and drill down a bit in the area of productivity. So earlier in the call you said the organization is clear on the opportunity with respect to free cash flow; and congratulations, you\u2019ve done a great job since taking over. But similarly, is the organization clear on the opportunity regarding productivity and this is something you intend to quantify for the investment community? Do you believe that the incentive structure at The Coca-Cola Company reflects this opportunity beyond just operating income targets, maybe something more specific at the business unit level? And then strategically maybe discuss the role of productivity as an enabler to fund reinvestment to sustain a top line growth? Thank you.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you. Yes, productivity is a critical part of the equation going forward. It\u2019s embedded in our long-term growth algorithm and so it\u2019s an area of particular focus for us here and around the world. I think it\u2019s important to highlight that for the last two to three years, it\u2019s offered an outsized portion of the expansion due to the reset of the cost base driven by the transformation plans that are being underway. As we look to the future and I think we talked about this at the Scotiabank conference in 2019, and similar to the cash flow conversation we\u2019re very clear on the levers that we have at our disposal to influence the productivity agenda, and it\u2019s got to be linked to the overall growth agenda as well. We are very clear on how they relate to the different businesses that we have; the core business, our Global Ventures group and our bottling organization. And so the short answer is yes, it\u2019s very much embedded in the operational plan. It\u2019s very much a part of the overall compensation model and we expect to continue to make progress, as I said, to deliver on our overall algorithm as we go into 2020 and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.\nJames Quincey: Thank you. As we talked about, we made good progress in 2019 by delivering on our financial commitments and growing in a sustainable way. We continue to transform the organization to act with a growth mindset, which gives us confidence in delivering our 2020 target and our ability to create a better shared future to our stakeholders. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us today. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions]. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors and, therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations Department if they have any questions.  I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Leveridge, Vice President and Investor Relations Officer. Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.\nTimothy Leveridge: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that we posted schedules under the Financial Reports and Information tab in the Investor section of our company website at www.coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles.  We'd also like to note that you can find additional materials in the Investor section of our company's website that provide an analysis of our margin structure. In addition, this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report.  Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions. [Operator Instructions]. Now let me turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. As you'll have seen from our earnings release earlier today, we continue to deliver strong results. We are part of a great industry with solid long-term growth potential. For our company, the power of aligned and engaged system is driving solid top line growth across all our operating segments. We see that innovation, revenue growth management and improving execution ,all supported by greater brand building, are helping us sustain momentum across our business.  Our associates within the organization and across the system are responding to the cultural changes we are driving. So through the 3 quarters of the year, we've gained global value share with a balanced contribution from both developed and emerging markets, we're sustaining that solid top line performance with growth across all the operating segments and we're on track to deliver our EPS commitments, as momentum in the business have helped offset increased currency headwinds. And as John will talk about, free cash flow is up strongly year-to-date, which is also encouraging.  Looking around the world. As I said, all our operating segments delivered solid organic growth. In EMEA, we've seen sustained revenue growth of 7% year-to-date. Importantly, we're seeing contributions to growth come as much from developed markets as the emerging markets. This is partly due to our revenue growth management efforts over the last few years. And it's pretty encouraging, as we continue to roll out these revenue growth management initiatives, to developed markets in other areas of the world.  In Asia Pacific, we've grown organic revenue 4% year-to-date. We're gaining horizontal distribution and recruiting new consumers in emerging markets, like Southeast Asia, India and China, leading to strong volume growth. In Japan, while we still have work to do, we're seeing sequential quarterly improvement in both volume and revenue. The system continues to rebuild manufacturing capacity, and we're adapting the fast-changing consumer environment and evolving our operating models to drive efficiencies and effectiveness.  Turning to Latin America. Again, we're driving positive momentum, despite a more challenging economic environment, and they're up 9% organic growth year-to-date. Brazil has sustained strong performance even as the macro has slowed a little in the third quarter. This has been driven by improved execution and consistent investment behind cold drink equipments. Our approach has enabled the business to grow twice the rate of consumer spending in the third quarter. Our business in Mexico has actively adjusted to the -- to a more challenging economic environment, shifting the portfolio towards affordability with a push on returnable packaging. This has led to improvement in trends as we've moved through the year. In Argentina, though, a worsening economic situation and higher inflation has affected consumer spending, impacting our business and our industry. However, by following our playbook of carefully balancing price increases, while also focusing on maintaining our consumer base, we have gained value share year-to-date.  Finally, turning to North America. We saw a strong marketplace performance driven by innovation in our sparkling portfolio and improving performance in stills. We also continue to gain share. And so far, revenue growth -- organic revenue growth is up 2% year-to-date. This growth was largely driven by continued strong consumer demand for No Sugar versions of some of our best known sparkling soft drink brands as well as for smaller packages with less sugar per serving. Of course, we always have the opportunity to get better. For example, our performance in the water category has not been as strong as we'd like. We're working on further plans to address this in the marketplace in the near future.  Taking a step back and looking across all our markets. We are driving a platform for sustained performance through a disciplined portfolio growth approach, an aligned and engaged system and collaboration with our stakeholders. Within our portfolio, we focused on operationalizing further our leader, challenger and explorer framework to build quality leadership positions in more brands in more markets.  While consumer behavior is rapidly evolving, we continue to find new ways to connect with consumers through our leader brands. For example, we see continued strong performance in our sparkling portfolio led by trademark Coca-Cola, with 3% volume growth and 6% retail value growth, so far this year. Our brand and formula has been around for more than 130 years, and we continually work to make Coke relevant to recruit new generations of consumers.  In addition to great marketing campaigns, consumer-centric innovation has been a key factor, especially over the last few years. This includes smaller packaging, such as mini cans, which are growing at a rate of more than 15% year-to-date in the U.S. It includes lower and no calorie variants that help consumers moderate their sugar intake. For example, Coke Zero Sugar is growing globally 14% volume year-to-date. And most recently, it's included new launchers such as Coke Energy and Coke Plus Coffee, which is designed for consumers looking for a little extra upliftment. We've launched Coke Energy in more than 25 markets, and we're adjusting as we learn to how consumers are responding. As you know, we have plans to bring Coke Energy to the U.S. in 2020. Overall, we're seeing more consumers drink products from our flagship trademark globally. Within challenger and explorer brands, innovation and sustained investment levels are helping drive performance across key geographies. In Asia, our Authentic Tea House brand is well ahead of the plan in China and across Southeast Asia. At the beginning of last year, we launched Fuze Tea in Europe. Now entering its second year, we've seen positive momentum in both revenue growth and share gains driven by marketing investments, innovation and added distribution. Fuze Tea has gained 3 points of value share across Western Europe, showing the importance of sustained investment to build challenger brands into leaders. Chi, West Africa's leading value-added dairy and juice brand, continues to perform well in the marketplace and expanded footprint across the region. The disciplined approach we are taking is yielding results. Consumers have responded, as shown by our sustained momentum. More broadly, we will continue to invest behind our brands.  Of course, strategy and marketing are only one part of the equation. Daily execution in the marketplace is also a critical component. Globally, our bottling partners are aligned and energized. They're committed to building scale and investing for the future. We're working with them to collectively raise the bar on consistent execution. Key levers of growth include driving new pack price architectures, increasing the availability of immediate consumption packages, expanding chilled space with more cold drink equipment and growing our customer base. In India, for example, immediate consumption transactions have grown double digit year-to-date, fueled by adding more than 650,000 new customer outlets during the year and placing more than 25 additional coolers in the market. These initiatives are allowing us to grow at double the rate of personal consumption expenditure. Globally, this kind of action has helped lead to volume growth in immediate consumption packages of 4% year-to-date.  Fundamentally, our business is driven by the ability to operate a more sustainable enterprise that makes a difference for all our stakeholders. And let me highlight one critical issue, we, of course, see across the world, which is package waste. We first shared our World Without Waste goals in 2018, and we provided updates from time to time. But I'd also like to share a recent example of initiatives around the world. In the U.S., we're working on a number of packaging plans with DASANI, including removing the equivalent of at least 1 billion virgin PET plastic bottles from the supply chain over the next 5 years. DASANI will introduce a lineup of recyclable, reusable and package-free options, including aluminum packages and expansion of PureFill water dispensers, which leverage our Coca-Cola Freestyle technology.  In Great Britain, our system has switched Sprite bottles from green to clear plastic to make it easier to recycle into new bottles. And in 2020, we will double the recycled plastic in all of our bottles in Great Britain to at least 50%.  In Australia, by the end of the year, all single-serve PET bottles will be made from 100% recycled plastic. Finally, we and our partners just unveiled the first sample bottle made with recovered and recycled marine plastics. This shows the future potential for ocean debris to be recycled, packaging for foods and drinks.  Of course, none of this will be possible without the people throughout our company and our system that take an expansive approach to imagining what's possible. This is what gives me confidence this company and system is building a better shared future.  So in summary, we're driving a platform for sustained performance through disciplined portfolio growth, an aligned and engaged system and are working with our stakeholders. For the first 9 months of the year, we delivered strong underlying growth ahead of our initial guidance. This gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full year EPS target and drive shareholder value.  And now I'm going to turn the call over to John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'd like to start with a quick update on a few key areas of focus I've mentioned previously that are critical to the company, driving sustainable top line growth, expanding margins across our business segments and improving cash flow.  As I look at our progress in 2019, our top line continues to respond to the actions James has just spoken to, both to drive innovation, revenue growth management and improved execution, and all supported by a comprehensive range of brand building initiatives across the world. Organic revenue is up 6% year-to-date, and we've reached the ninth consecutive quarter of being within our long-term target. Our healthy top line and effective cost management are translating into solid underlying operating margin expansion across all 3 areas of the business: our geographic segments, Global Ventures and Bottling Investments. And we're doing this while continuing to invest in our brands. We've made steady progress in improving our free cash flow position, which is up 41% year-to-date. We're achieving this through solid underlying performance, acting on working capital initiatives, in addition to tapering off our productivity and restructuring costs.  Our progress has enabled us to grow in line with our earnings per share expectations, despite an 8 point currency headwind, setting us up to meet our guidance for the year. We are pleased that the business is responding to the actions we've been taking. But as always, we aim to do better. We will continue to make the right investments in the business to sustain this momentum into the future.  Turning to our financial performance for the quarter. We delivered solid 5% organic revenue growth with contributions across all operating segments. As expected, revenue growth was driven by strong price/mix due to our revenue growth management initiatives in the marketplace, along with some items we are cycling from the prior year.  The biggest driver of these items was cycling increased inventory levels in our Brazilian Bottler's from last year. This put more than 2 points of pressure on concentrate sales in the quarter, and this was partially offset by a corresponding price/mix benefit as our Brazilian business revenue per case is lower than the company average. We are also cycling the timing of certain deductions in the third quarter of last year, which was a slight benefit to price/mix in the quarter. However, no impact on the year-to-date performance. So adjusting for these items, I would look at this quarter's 5% organic revenue growth as being on an apples-to-apples basis, 1% volume and 4% price/mix.  Underlying growth margin expanded about 120 basis points during the quarter with contribution across our geographic segments, Global Ventures and Bottling Investments. Operating margin was roughly even on an underlying basis, negatively impacted by cycling the timing of expenses and concentrate shipments in the prior year, in addition to the timing of certain items in the current year, including investments in marketing. This translated to 5% growth in comparable currency neutral operating income, which was more than offset by a stronger-than-anticipated 7% currency headwind. Comparably, EPS declined 2% in the quarter, impacted by a 6 point currency headwind.  Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. With the momentum we see in the business, we're now guiding to organic revenue growth of at least 5%. This is translating into stronger underlying profit growth and an increase in our free cash flow guidance to at least $6.5 billion. Our underlying performance allows us to maintain our full year comparable EPS guidance, even in the face of increasing currency headwinds compared to previous expectations.  Staying on currency for a moment. On the second quarter call, we provided an initial review -- view of 2020, namely that based on rates at that time, we expected a benign outlook. Since then, the dollar has strengthened, which has impacted our outlook for the -- for next year. Based on those recent movements, there will be an approximate 1 to 2 point currency headwind of revenue. And given the natural multiplier effect due to business mix, a 2 to 3 point headwind at operating income for full year 2020. This is almost entirely from movement in market rates as our hedging gains and losses in 2019 are minimal so far.  With respect to our hedging program, we are nearly 100% hedged for the G10 currencies in 2020, but we have minimal hedges today for our non-G10 currencies. It goes without saying that several geopolitical factors can have an impact on our currency outlook between now and when we provide our full 2020 guidance in February.  Coming back to 2019. In quarter 4, there are a couple of things you should consider. First, we have an additional day in the fourth quarter, which adds about 1 point of revenue growth. Second, we expect an estimated 2 point headwind to top line growth, biggest factor being the reduction in inventory levels by our European bottlers. You may recall that in the first quarter, price/mix and concentrate shipments benefited from those bottlers increasing their safety stocks in advance of a potentially disruptive Brexit. We currently expect this to fully reverse in quarter 4, but, of course, it's subject to the pending Brexit outcome. The net of these 2 will result in a 1 point headwind to top line growth for the quarter.  So in summary, we are pleased with the momentum we have in the business. We continue to invest for sustainable growth in the future, and we remain very focused on raising the performance bar everywhere to capture the opportunity available to us.  Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nStephen Powers: I almost hate to start on currency because there's so much talk about elsewhere, but it is a topic that's dominated conversation the last few months, especially. So John, looking ahead, I think the currency outlook for 2020 is less severe than a lot of investors feared. But I guess, the question is what levers do you feel you have to offset such FX impacts in terms of managing to dollar-based EPS and cash flow. My read is that in the past, the company leaned more on financial levers and hedging to try to work through FX headwinds, whereas now you think you can lean a little bit more on operating levers, like productivity and realized price/mix. But is that right? I just love a little bit more color if possible as to how you're thinking about it and, more importantly, how we should all think about your flexibility, especially to the extent that FX volatility and, I hope this isn't the case, but if it continues to get worse.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Steve. Just a few comments. First of all, you're correct in that the outlook, as we go into 2020, it's an easier picture to paint given what I just described in the call. Secondly, I think it's important to emphasize that our overall growth algorithm continues to start with an objective to win locally in all of our markets around the world and to take the appropriate actions to be able to do that on a sustained basis. I think, at the moment, we are also doing, I think, a much more integrated job in determining with our local operating leaders the degree to which we can also manage the various headwinds and leverage, the tailwinds that we have on an ongoing basis and particularly with respect to currency.  As we think about next year, there's a lot of puts and takes still in the equation on both the operating and the nonoperating line, which we'll obviously provide more detailed guidance when we get to February. But I think the overall point I'd make is that with respect to managing this space as we go forward, it's important to keep in mind our primary focus is to deliver on that algorithm I just talked about, but we're doing it, I think, in a much more connected fashion around the world and taking advantage where it's possible of levers that allow us to mitigate some of the -- some of those headwinds.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: I just want to ask a little bit about cash flow. So in particular, on CapEx, I think you took down the CapEx budget this quarter, but my recollection is you actually raised it last quarter. So John, I know you've talked sort of a conscious effort to reassess balance sheet overall and then obviously cash flow, so wondering if you could talk a little bit about kind of the change in CapEx and how you're thinking about that going forward.\nJohn Murphy: Sure. Thanks, Lauren. Yes, let me start just to emphasize year-to-date, the strong cash flow is driven by underlying growth. We're cycling some taxes that we paid in the prior year. We're getting the benefit from the -- from working capital and from the -- a lowering of our onetime restructuring payments. In the fourth quarter, we expect to see the -- our capital expenditures finish the year in line with our previous guidance, actually just a little bit lower. I think we started at $2.4 billion. We're down to $2.2 billion. And the timing of a number of the projects we have is actually scheduled for the fourth quarter. So there's really no major change in our expectation for this year and going to next year with respect to CapEx. But as I've discussed in some previous conversations, the improvement in overall free cash flow remains a top priority for us, and we expect to continue to work on the initiatives that I've just outlined as we go forward.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: John, I also wanted to keep on the cash flow topic. Operating cash flow guidance also moved up for the full year this quarter. So what's driving that? And as you think about the improved free cash flow outlook, you've now raised underlying free cash flow a couple of quarters in a row ex the structural items. So is that more timing-related and you're getting traction on some of the initiatives you put into place given your focus on this area? Or is it more you're discovering greater efficiencies with that focus and that means that the confidence around improving free cash flow conversion is actually moving up as you look beyond this year?\nJohn Murphy: Yes. Thanks, Dara. First of all, I think the primary driver for this year is the underlying performance of the business. And so we're seeing an uptick in overall -- the overall delivery from operations. Yes, we have a plan underway, which is delivering on working capital. We're not -- I don't see -- I don't have any new news to talk about the working capital arena, but we just continue to plug away at the opportunities that we know are out there.  And with respect to CapEx, as I just mentioned in my -- in the previous question, we see, for this year or next year, the range to be in the -- in that $2.2 billion, $2.4 billion taking into account of the fact that we have taken back into the full South Africa and the Philippines in the last 12 to 18 months. So going forward, I expect to see the continued health of the business in the primary driver. And we will continue to advance on the working capital plan, as I've previously discussed. And also as we go into next year, we will see a further tapering off of the onetime restructuring and productivity cost that we've incurred as part of the productivity program over the last three years.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: I wanted to ask about unit volume this quarter was -- and year-to-date has been pretty good, but in the press release and also in prepared remarks, you talked a bit about just the focus on immediate consumption, cooler placements, right, which also just kind of smaller pack types, right? So it's -- so if you -- could you just give us a sense of just where transactions are trending relative to unit case volumes and just some color on that to get a better perspective and just whether the lift is even bigger or better than what we see in unit cases?\nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean absolutely, it's being driven by a strategic focus on immediate consumption packages and smaller packages, in particular. Lots of different shapes and sizes, no pun intended. Example, the U.S., the mini cans growing at 15%, so some clear strategic focus on driving immediate consumption and smaller packages. Transactions have been running ahead of average unit cases for a number of quarters there. It's running about 4% compared to about 2% on volume. So clearly, this is encouraging and something that we're after. And so it's heartening to see that the transactions coming in perhaps to simply put a point ahead all of unit cases.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.\nAli Dibadj: So I only have one question, but let me try to have questions, but both are just clarification questions. One, given that you're establishing the free cash flow improvement as perhaps the next leg of the Coke story, can you talk more about when we should think about that cash being used to buy back more stock than just the dilution because you curtailed that obviously a while ago? And then secondly, you talked again a little bit about this in the prepared remarks, so it's a half question. The gap between the 0 basis points improvement on operating margin -- underlying operating margin versus 120 basis points on underlying gross margin. Can you just elaborate a little bit more about what you're doing there from an investment perspective?\nJames Quincey: Maybe I'll start with the first half of the two questions. Free cash flow, look, we've been pretty clear as we've gone around, which is we have a dividend coverage, which is not where we wanted to be. We set ourselves a target of expanding that, but also made a clear point that it would clearly be our intent to see the dividend continue to grow. So we would like to see EPS track for multiple periods ahead of the dividend growth and obviously have the cash flow grow faster than the earnings. From where we are now, that -- we need some runway to get to a more comfortable point. So of course, when we come to our guidance for 2020 next year, we'll be clear on what we're doing, but I don't think we are likely to have a programmatic increase until there's substantially more flexibility.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC.\nSunil Modi: James, maybe you could just talk about and give us an update on cost and really trying to understand what the longer-term vision is with that particular part of the business. And then if I can slip another one in, and apologies for doing this, but you've talked in the past about kind of the balance sheet and kind of realign to the prior question. So just where are we in that process in terms of thinking about some of the equity investments you have and potentially having some cash to realign the balance sheet, so you can kind of fix the cash flow situation?\nJames Quincey: Yes. Sure. I mean cost, we've talked a little bit about it in the last call. The integration -- or the separation from Whitbread and the integration in the Coke system has gone well ahead of schedule. We bought the associates over. The business is also up. That's been accomplished successfully. It will be fair to say that in the short term, the U.K. business has been impacted by the consumer sentiment driven by Brexit in the U.K., which has affected everyone, the entire business outlook in the U.K. But I think, over the long term, we're actually more encouraged about the opportunities to drive the various platforms.  And we certainly see a lot of interest, and we're setting up the partnerships with the bottlers and working with customers on how we can bring a package of coffee platforms to support that growth, whether it be the Costa Express machine, which is -- continues to have a lot of extra placements coming through this year. And we see a lot more as we go into the future, all providing Proud to Serve or beans and machines as a service to customers and, then at some point, ready to drink, which is not going to likely be the first entry point. We'd like to see the brand exist before doing ready-to-drink. But we launched it in the U.K. and early days, but sales are ahead of expectations. It's doing very well in the context of the coffee strategy. So we see some good validation of the strategic idea of using the different platforms with our system to drive coffee as a solution for customers around the world.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: I was just trying to see what are your plans for Coke Energy in terms of ACV in the U.S. and how broadly you would think it can be positioned in terms of the shelf for the energy shelf? And if I can squeeze a Latin American question, I would appreciate it, but I'll defer to you.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Andrea. So Coke Energy, obviously, we've launched it in sort of 20-plus countries around the world so far in 2019. And I think we've got some excellent learnings. It's resonated -- some things have resonated in some places. We've got some learnings on things we need to improve. We've been able to build that into the -- a sort of 2.0 version that we'll be rolling out in the U.S. I think the U.S. marketplace, in order to really drive towards a strategy that brings new consumers into the energy category, we're moving the flavor profile closer to Coke. Plans -- we'll save some of the bells and whistles of the plans for a later date, so that a very clear approach in the U.S. to drive additional growth for the energy category by taking the product closer in flavor to Coca-Cola Classic. And then in the rest of the world where we have launched it in some of those markets, we'll be building on the learnings to date and evolving next year. And we see an opportunity to play a role for Coke Energy in the energy category and within the Coke franchise to bring some new consumers and some new relevance to the trademark.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: You think about talking -- you mentioned affordable packaging in Mexico and that aligns with what we're hearing from a bunch of other CPG companies, including Diageo, which is normally high-end spirits. Is there something perhaps more secular permanent that you're seeing in some of these markets that leads you to focus more on affordability rather than just an economic cycle?\nJames Quincey: I think it's largely the economic cycle, especially in the case of Latin America. I mean there's no doubt that there's been a difference in the last 10 years than the previous 10 years where, prior to financial crisis, there was more creation in the middle ground. And over the last 10 years, there's been a section of society in -- all around the world that have felt under pressure, the lower income end. And more of the wealth has been generated at the top -- while income has been generated at the top. So you've seen, in the last 10 years, in general, across many industries a bifurcation growth in both the top end of the luxury end and growth in the value end. And so yes, there is a piece here, in general, of a spreading out of the pricing spectrum in categories based on that trend. But I think, in the case of Latin America and Mexico that we've talked about, this is very much the kind of the pressure that some of these economies have been under lately and a doubling down on affordability. And the reason we've been out there is because we have an infrastructure that's very much a set up to be able to serve the needs of those with less income.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore.\nRobert Ottenstein: James, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about trademark Coke in the U.S. It's doing quite nicely. And what I'm interested in learning is in terms of what's going on with the business, is it primarily share gains from your competitors? Or are you recruiting new customers to the brand? I'm particularly interested in how the brand is doing with consumers, let's say, under the age of 30 or 20, whatever number you want to take and to what extent you're able to continue to keep the brand very vibrant with the younger consumers.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean I think, firstly, clearly, part of this is a revitalization of the sparkling business. It's clear that the strategy of making Coke the brand relevant with marketing, with innovation, of getting it in formats that are more on target for consumers, whether that be the Zero Sugar or the smaller packages is part of getting growth to be in the sparkling soft drinks category. And I think you can see that and as a demonstration of what is going on with Coke. So I mean in a way, it's a formula that's always been true and is true around the world. You need innovation, you need marketing, you need relevance, you need packaging, you need execution and you need to be able to engage. And I think what you're starting to see is, yes, some reconsideration of the category by whatever age you want to take it down to, let's call it loosely, the millennials of the sparkling category. Has it flip-flopped overnight? No, it hasn't, but I think you're starting to see that if you bring relevantly marketed innovation for the right occasion to people, then they will engage.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.\nWilliam Chappell: Just want to follow back up on Brexit kind of near term and longer term. Didn't fully understand, for fourth quarter, is it -- if Brexit goes through, you'll have to destock and if it doesn't, you won't? Or is it automatically, the destock is expected to happen? And then do you expect, again, if Brexit goes through, for a pickup in sales? I mean do you expect a better environment as we move into 2020?\nJames Quincey: Well, I mean, if it mercifully all comes to an end, then yes, I do think our sentiment will improve, maybe not overnight, but over time and, hopefully, going into 2020. I think it's not as mechanistic of if they pass the vote, the stock drops out and if they don't pass the vote, the stock doesn't drop out. We'll need to see what happens tomorrow. I mean call us on Monday. We'll see what happens tomorrow with the super vote. But we would clearly like to err to seeing inventories normalize. So our preferred path would be to see normalization of the inventory by the end of the year. Clearly, we need to see what form the agreement does or doesn't take in the coming days. But as you should take it from us that our preferred outcome is unwinding of that extra inventory, but it's no -- there's no guarantee because we need to manage through it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim.\nLaurent Grandet: Just to put off actually Coke Energy. I mean you announced the launch of Coke Energy in the U.S. from January 1 with 4 SKUs in total, 2 more than in Europe and at a price point where it's just in the middle between Red Bull and Monster and not any more aligned with Red Bull. So I'd like to understand what are the learnings you get from the launch you already did this year that triggered those changes. And what do you expect, I mean, for Coke Energy in the U.S.?\nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean I think the two most obvious learnings, one I mentioned that I'll just repeat, which is to bring the formula of Coke Energy closer to Coke Classic. The energy category in the U.S. is much more developed than many of the other markets. And therefore, we are clearly taking an approach of trying to bring new consumers into the category rather than competing for the current ones. And we believe that based on our experiences in the launch markets and our research in the U.S. that doing so with a formula closer to Coke will be more effective.  On the pricing, clearly, the structure of the pricing and the relative weights of competitors at price points in the U.S. is different to Europe. And therefore, we've chosen to go in that -- in a slightly different direction or slightly more balanced starting point with a broader portfolio of SKUs. Obviously, we're looking for shelf visibility by having the full packages of the 4 variants. And that's kind of part of what, of course, is a learning from Coke Energy, but actually that's true in many other categories, that you need to have some standout especially if the shelf has a lot of SKUs in it already. I mean if you go to some of the markets where we launched around the world and the energy category is underdeveloped, 1 or 2 SKUs is enough to make an impact. But if you're in a more developed part of the world and there's more competitive offering, then you need a bit more presence. And I think that's what's driving that. And we'll launch in the U.S. And no doubt, we'll learn and we'll continue to evolve and focus on driving this as part of driving the Coke Trademark and the revitalization of the Coke Trademark, which has been very pleasing for all of us.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets.\nAmit Sharma: James, it looks like the message, at least on the consumption point of view, is still fairly upbeat even as the macros continue to get a little bit tougher. And you've talked about that a little bit from a profitability point of view in L.A. But can you elaborate that a little bit historical connection between consumption and GDP? Is that changing a little bit? Or is the playbook different for Coke than it has been in the past recessions?\nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean, firstly, yes, on a long-term basis, our business is correlated with GDP growth. So in the long run, that matters. Secondly, as I commented in the last quarter, there are some storm clouds in the sky. It -- have raining in a few places, but it's not -- there's not a total problem here. And I think the approach we're taking is to not overinvest our time looking in the news as to whether that is or isn't a global recession, but to focus on what we can do and to recognize that a lot of work has revitalized our top line. And our emerging bottom line has been up in the actions we've taken. And as we look around the world, whilst we can certainly find places where we do things really well, we are not a 10 out of 10 on any of the strategic initiatives all over the world. So we have a lot more we can do over our marketing and portfolio management, on innovation, on revenue growth management, on investment in the media consumption and calls and on execution. And so the way we look at it is, look, you could waste your time looking at the forecast, but actually, if we stick to our needing and execute against that strategy, we can drive the growth we need.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie.\nCaroline Levy: And congratulations on a great growth on brand Coke.\nJames Quincey: Thank you.\nCaroline Levy: I just want to touch on Global Ventures and Bottling Investments, which are businesses that should see faster top line growth than the rest of the business, I think. And the Global Ventures margin looks like running around 11% to 12% and bottling around 3%. So are these sort of unusually low levels because of all the recent changes in both divisions, the creation of one and the change in the other? And do you see those trending upwards beginning in 2020? Or is that longer term? And maybe you can just help us size out what a more normalized margin might look like on those businesses.\nJames Quincey: So let me start with that one. Yes. So firstly, should Global Ventures and BIG be going faster than the average? Yes. Clearly, part of the idea of the Global Ventures is we've invested in categories that we are treating slightly differently in order to drive much better growth. So one, yes, they should be growing faster.  Two, when looking at Global Ventures, and we might try and kind of explain more when we get to the February guidance, it's got a mix of some very different businesses, whether that be the Dogadan tea business or Innocent or the Monster partnership or Costa. So I don't think you can talk about a normalized margin for Global Ventures because it encompasses a set of different businesses. But what we certainly should see is faster growth on the top and the bottom line.  And in the case of BIG, clearly, we had a lot of ins and outs on that group. But I think if you like, philosophically, historically, we have, perhaps in using the expression hospital ward for some of our bottlers, invited the idea that they should be -- or that they're going to be underperforming. And I don't think that's how we want to look at that going forward. We think they should be making margin returns and growth rates that are equivalent to what the best of our bottlers do in like markets. I mean the margin structures in emerging markets and developed ones are not the same, but we should certainly be aspiring and heading towards performance that is above average for a like-for-like market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sean King with UBS.\nSean King: Just maybe a little bit in a whiz, but given that this is the first time you're giving your -- a preliminary next year FX outlook and considering the very recent favorable move, when did you mark currencies to market for that outlook?\nJohn Murphy: Let me take that. Monday, that's the very precise answer.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: And congratulations on the strong result.\nJames Quincey: Thank you.\nKevin Grundy: Question on price/mix. You spend a lot of time on these calls discussing the various initiatives around revenue growth management. And while unit case results are quite good, the price/mix contribution is 6%, certainly materially higher than The Street had modeled and what we should expect going forward. So a few questions related to that, James. I mean, one, had price/mix come in relative to your own expectations in the quarter? Two, how much did Argentina contributed in the quarter? And then three, how should we be thinking about this in the fourth quarter and into next year?\nJames Quincey: Sure. So clearly, price/mix is atypically higher. It is -- there's a little bit of Argentina in that. But actually, there's a quite a bit about cycling some of the inventory that was in Brazil from last year. So I think it's much more sensibly thought of as a 4% rather than a 6%. Still a excellent number for the quarter. And I think if you look back over what's been happening in '18 and '19, you're seeing more of a 3%. Obviously, it was a number we expected to come in. And so I think the revenue growth management initiatives, which have been rolled out and still have some good runway ahead of them, along with the brand building and innovation, which earns us the right to be able to put the right pricing into the marketplace, is what makes us think we can take that forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.\nBonnie Herzog: I actually wanted to ask on margins. You've really done a good job of telegraphing some of the pressures you're facing from a margin perspective this year. But that said, just hoping you could give us a sense as to how we should expect margins to trend over the next years once the effects of FX and M&A start to subside. I think it would be helpful to hear some of the key levers you have that you can pull to ultimately drive margin expansion and really just touch on what gives you the confidence that the business can grow margins on an underlying basis.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Bonnie. Let me take that. First of all, as I said, when we look at the total company, we're really looking at margins across the 3 business segments that we have, our geographic core businesses, Global Ventures and the Bottling Investments Group. Within each of those businesses, we -- we've got pretty clear line of sight on the levers that we have at our disposal. Starting with the top line -- if I take for example in our -- in the core business, starting on our top line, innovation and increasing focus on premiumizing the innovation agenda, continuing to take advantage of the revenue growth management works that's -- that we -- that's been in its current iteration and expanding that around the world are examples of ways in which we can drive at the -- certainty at the gross margin line. Cost management across each of these three groups, there's a different bucket of cost in each and there's ongoing -- we see ongoing opportunity to operate more efficiently and more effectively. And specifically within the marketing arena, we have a large $5 billion, $6 billion base. We continue to mind new ways of driving greater output from that investment base.  So overall, we -- we're confident that margin expansion, as is implicit in our long-term growth model, is manageable. Our performance year-to-date -- underlying performance year-to-date would -- gives me confidence that, that can continue. And as we work towards the February call and talk more about 2020, we'll be in a position to give you a little more texture on some of the specific areas of opportunity in the coming 12 months.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company.\nVivien Azer: I was hoping to dig in a little bit more on the mini can business in the U.S., which is clearly doing exceptionally well. So a couple of questions on that. Number one, can you just remind what it represents as a percentage of sales for the Coca-Cola franchise? Number two, do you have any targets over the next kind of 1, 2, 3 years in terms of continued -- continuing to drive that mix shift? And number three, are there any CapEx considerations around future growth of mini cans or small format more broadly?\nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean we don't break out the percentage of the total business that mini cans is representing. But certainly, we are focused on driving that. Along with a series of other immediate consumption packages and smaller format packages, I think the mini cans being the most emblematic one, it grew 15% this quarter. So we're very pleased with this opportunity. We don't kind of, as a target to pursue, I said, well, it should be this percent of sales because, ultimately, if you're going to be consumer-centric, you will end up with the percentage that the consumers want to buy rather than what you want to sell. And so I think, philosophically, we focus most on making our brands or our packages or whatever bundle we're selling drive on the relevancy for the consumer. And if that's -- if we've got it right it, it will go up. And if we haven't, we have to go back to the drawing board. It is worth noting that mini cans do require some CapEx. And so, yes, the more successful they are, the more we'll have to adjust some of the manufacturing footprint to do it, but that's a good problem to have.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.\nJames Quincey: So thanks very much, everyone. To conclude and summarize, our performance, again, gives us confidence that our strategies are taking hold within the organization and across the system. And we remain focused on delivering our near-term and long-term goals. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us today. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions]. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors and, therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations Department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Leveridge, Vice President and Investor Relations Officer. Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.\nTimothy Leveridge: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that we posted schedules under the Financial Reports and Information tab in the Investors section of our company website at www.coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussions to our reports as -- to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. I would also like to note that you can find additional materials on the Investors section of our company website, including those that provide an analysis of our margin structure. In addition, this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions. [Operator Instructions]. Now let me turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. So here we are halfway through the year, and we see good momentum in our business as we continue our transformation as a total beverage company. We gained global value share with a balanced contribution from both developed and emerging markets led by strong performance in our sparkling soft drink business. Organic revenue growth is up 6% year-to-date, including growth across all operating segments and with a good balance between volume and pricing. Worth noting, about a point of that is due to benefit of timing. The underlying results, though, are still ahead of plan. Unit case growth -- volume grew 2% year-to-date and 3% in the quarter. Comparable currency-neutral EPS was up 13% year-to-date, partially offset by a stronger-than-anticipated 9% currency headwind resulting in comparable EPS growth of 3%. While currencies continued to be headwind, we are focused on achieving our full year EPS target through stronger performance in the underlying business. Looking around the world, we delivered strong top line growth in the first half driven by both developed and emerging markets. In Asia Pacific, we grew organic revenue 4% during the first half of the year. Strong performance in emerging markets like India, Southeast Asia and China drove 7% volume growth for the segment as we focused on underserved consumption occasions. This was partially offset by performance in Japan where our system continues to work through supply chain disruptions stemming from last year's natural disasters. In addition, volume declined in Japan during the second quarter as our system implemented the first price increase to consumers in over 25 years. Looking ahead, we expect improving results in the back half as consumers adjust to the new pricing levels and we implement a robust innovation plan including Coke Energy and Innocent chilled juice. Turning to EMEA. Here, we grew organic revenue 9% year-to-date driven by continued growth in Europe and Turkey, improved performance in South Africa and the first quarter benefit from our shipment timing. Across Europe, revenue growth management initiatives and Zero Sugar innovations are creating sustained momentum in the majority of our markets as shown by the 3% volume growth in our European sparkling soft drink portfolio. And in Turkey, despite the challenging macro environment, we are delivering a solid performance due to strong marketing and execution plans that are quickly adapting to the local conditions. Turning to Latin America. Here we delivered 7% organic revenue growth year-to-date amidst a mixed operating environment. Brazil continues to deliver strong performance driven by better execution within a stable operating environment while Argentina continues to grapple with the economic crisis. Mexico's economic growth is slowing so we expect tougher operating conditions. However, we are adjusting our plans to ensure affordability, so that the business continues to grow sustainably. Finally, turning to North America. Here, our results continued to mark steady progress driven by improved marketing and execution. Our performance was largely driven by consumer demand for No Sugar versions of some of our best-known sparkling soft drink brands as well as for the smaller packages with less sugar. Retail sales of our No Sugar sparkling soft drink portfolio grew 6% in the quarter in Nielsen-measured channels. Strong revenue growth for our core sparkling soft drink brands continues to fuel and enable new innovations and investments across our expanding total beverage portfolio. For example, our premium water brands, smartwater and Topo Chico, are delivering healthy growth supported by the national launch of smartwater antioxidant and smartwater alkaline and the ongoing strategic expansion of Topo Chico. Across all of our markets, we are driving a platform for sustained performance through disciplined portfolio growth and aligned and engaged system and collaboration with our stakeholders. Beginning with our portfolio growth. Here, we are making progress in operationalizing our leader, challenger and explorer framework consistent with the strategy we outlined last year. Within our leaders, the core sparkling soft drink business registered healthy volume growth of 2% year-to-date with trademark Coke continuing to perform very well with volume up 3% year-to-date and 4% in the quarter fueling our portfolio expansion. Importantly, we're seeing healthy household penetration growth for our sparkling soft drink portfolio. Whilst also encouraging is Coke Zero Sugar is now in its third year of double-digit volume growth. Along with our focus on smaller packaging and premium innovation, year-to-date, we are growing trademark Coke revenue faster than transactions, transactions faster than volume and reducing calories, what we believe is a winning strategy for the future. Our innovation pipeline. Our innovation pipeline for Coke Trademark expanded in April with the launch of Coke Energy, offering the edge of a great refreshing taste and an inclusive brand. The energy occasion is fast growing and expanding in multiple spaces to satisfy more consumers. We remain fully committed to our partnership with Monster, and we believe there are opportunities to capture even more value in the energy category for the Coca-Cola system and to bring new drinkers into our rapidly evolving category. The initial results are encouraging. In Spain, the first market where Coke Energy was launched, has already captured 2% share of the energy category modern trade and it has achieved similar sales for outlet as the market leader with strong repeat levels that indicate good consumer acceptance. We're taking everything we have learned and applying these insights as we rapidly scale Coke Energy across our system. We are currently in 14 countries, and by the end of 2019, we expect to have Coke Energy available in 20 markets. Coke Energy, along with many of our other innovations, are being created to target specific occasions and need states but in very different ways, particularly as we grow our challengers and explorers. For example, in Australia, we recently launched NutriBoost after learning from its success in Vietnam. NutriBoost is a nutritious milk drink with zero added sugar that was designed for busy families looking for a mid-morning or afternoon energizing snack. With this, our focus on consumer-centric innovation, almost 25% of our revenue is now from new or reformulated products, up from 15% 2 years ago. At the same time, we are taking a disciplined approach to curating our portfolio to ensure we have the capacity to focus on the right brands. So far, this year, over 275 zombie SKUs have been eliminated. We're also making progress on our plans to build a multiplatform coffee business. Since we finalized the Costa acquisition in January, we've been moving with speed across three areas: integrating Costa into our business, making sure Costa's existing clients are executed well and accelerating the opportunity to build a multiplatform business. As we move forward on these opportunities, our focus is on accelerating three segments: the express vending machines, beans and machines for food service customers and ready-to-drink products. We've already launched ready-to-drink products in the U.K. with plans to roll out in additional markets in the coming months. And consistent with our other innovations, ready-to-drink Costa leverages a unique brand and product edge that will allow us to capture category growth. We're also accelerating our plans to roll out more express machines across a number of markets. So far, this year, we've placed 1,200 new vending machines and have plans for many more by the end of the year. Finally, as you may have seen last week, we reached an agreement with Coca-Cola Hellenic to launch Costa Coffee across a number of formats within all their markets over the next three years. Returning to the overall view. Of course, none of this works without our bottling partners. Globally, our bottling partners are aligned and energized and committed to building scale and investing into the future, and we're working with them to collectively raise the bar on our consistent execution. I've talked before about the revenue growth management initiatives, which are helping to drive increased velocity in our portfolio. Coupled with this has been a focus on expanding horizontal distribution through opening new outlets and placing more cold drink equipment. And we're making progress, especially in Asia where our system opened over 750,000 new outlets so far this year. However, gaining penetration is only part of the equation. Consistently measuring and managing our performance in existing outlets is the other part that drives sustained performance. So, we're working to better leverage data and mobile technology in order to evolve our Right Execution Daily platform from a point-in-time scorecard into real-time integrated analytics capabilities that will drive faster and better-formed execution decisions across our system. Before moving off our bottling system, let me quickly our address our plans in Africa. In May, we announced that we were stepping back from our plans to refranchise Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. Instead, we will hold onto the bottler until we move through a period of political and economic change in the region. But to be clear, our bottling ownership philosophy hasn't changed. As with all our bottling investments, we will look to sell at the right time to the right buyer. In the meantime, we have a new and energized leadership teams on both sides of the system, and we are already seeing promising results. Finally, in order to deliver long-term, sustainable growth, we must collaborate with our stakeholders. One critical issue facing the world is plastic waste. In 2018, we announced our World Without Waste goals through recycling, recyclable packaging and the use of recycled material. As noted in our earnings release, we are making progress against our goals. We used approximately 30% recycled material in our packaging globally in 2018. We now have 100% recycled PET bottles in the market in over half a dozen countries with more launches planned in 2019. And importantly, our system is also working to improve collection. We currently refill or collect equivalent of 58% of what we sell in the marketplace. While global traction will take time given the need for infrastructure investments and various regulations by our market, we're actively working to lift and shift successful collection models such as PETCO in South Africa, ECOCE in Mexico and Coca-Cola Amatil is already leading our collaboration to run a deposit return scheme across all of its territories in Australia. Ultimately, the heart of our success are our people. We've been working to continue to build our growth culture because that is what will drive our performance year-after-year, moving faster, taking intelligent risks and learning from our mistakes. And I think this is beginning to show in our results. So, in summary, we had a good first half of the year as evidenced by our solid organic growth rate. We're driving a platform for sustained performance through disciplined portfolio growth, an aligned and engaged system and collaboration with our stakeholders. And the momentum in our business gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full year EPS target and drive shareholder value. Now I'll turn it over to John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Before addressing our performance in the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year, I'd like to start by discussing a few key areas that I believe are critical to the company, specifically, driving healthy top line growth, expanding margins across our business segments, improving cash flow and leveraging a disciplined capital allocation process. James has talked about our revenue growth management efforts. This quarter, we've continued to scale our work in both Asia and Latin America. We're implementing better analytical tools and processes to develop price/pack architectures to meet evolving consumer and customer needs. And it's showing results, contributing to the robust organic revenue growth we've delivered now for the past eight quarters. Translating top line performance into sustainable margin improvement is where our ongoing productivity efforts and leader, challenger, explorer framework come into play. For the first half of the year, we delivered underlying operating margin improvement, a function of continued innovation, revenue growth management strategies and the effective management of our cost structure. We've also advanced our efforts to improve cash flow and capital allocation. We're improving our working capital as evidenced by our year-to-date cash flow increase. We're taking a close look at all assets on our balance sheet. For example, we're in the process of selling our building in New York and we recently divested our equity stake in our Peruvian bottler. And we are reducing the sizable costs related to our productivity program that were part of the transformation of our business. So, we're making progress, and we aim to do even better. Turning now to our financial performance in the quarter. We delivered another solid quarter with broad-based organic revenue growth, underlying margin expansion and improving cash flow trends. Organic revenue grew 6% with a healthy balance of price/mix and volume and a 1-point benefit from timing. Our developing and emerging markets drove strong volume performance, which resulted in strong growth in our Bottling Investments Group. A continued rollout of revenue growth management initiatives across our developed markets resulted in good price/mix. Comparable margins contracted in the second quarter due to the impact of acquisitions and currency. However, both growth and operating margins expanded on an underlying basis. This translated into 14% currency-neutral operating income growth, partially offset by an 8-point currency headwind. The currency impact to operating income included a 2-point impact from hedging activity driven entirely by gains we are cycling from the prior year. Comparable EPS grew 4% in the quarter, which was comprised of 13% comparable currency-neutral growth, partially offset by a stronger-than-expected 9% currency headwind. And finally, year-to-date free cash flow was up $3.7 billion, up 87% due largely to strong underlying growth, working capital initiatives and the timing of cash taxes and capital expenditures. While we do not expect a similar increase in the back half of the year, we are confident in our ability to deliver at least $6 billion in free cash flow. Now looking at the remainder of the year. For the first half, we delivered 6% organic revenue growth, and as James noted, about a point of this came from the timing of shipments, which we expect to reverse in the back half. But after normalizing for the timing benefit, the best way to think about our underlying top line performance for the first half is 5%. Considering this strong performance, we are taking up our guidance on organic revenue to 5% for the full year, which is translating into stronger underlying profit performance, and that better underlying performance is enabling us to maintain our full year comparable EPS guidance even as currencies have gotten worse and structural changes are less of a benefit than we expected at the beginning of the year. As you model the flow of the year, there's a few items to consider in terms of phasing due to cycling, the timing of shipments and expenses, moderating currency headwinds and an extra day in the fourth quarter. We expect all of the comparable operating income growth in the back half of the year to occur in the fourth quarter. Specific to currency in the third quarter, we expect a 6-point currency impact to operating income. This includes a 3-point impact from hedging activity driven almost entirely by gains we are cycling from the prior year as year-over-year spot rate headwinds are softening. As we move through the back half of the year, we expect the impact from currencies to become less of a headwind. Looking even further out at current spot rates and hedge positions, we expect a benign currency environment in 2020 compared to 2019. As always, our Investor Relations team will be happy to answer any questions as you build out your models for the year. So, in summary, we've had a strong first half of the year. Our strategies are driving strong performance in our business. Cash flow is improving, and we remain very focused on delivering our full year EPS guidance. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nStephen Powers: So, a very solid set of results today. I guess the question from here, notwithstanding some of the timing factors that may cause some movement in the back half, just is what makes you most confident that this momentum can continue, if not further improve as you look out over the next few years? And perhaps as an underappreciated part of that story, how do you view improvements in your -- the current bottling footprint factoring into that momentum? I mean bottling clearly contributed this quarter. And I guess the question is that an aberration? Or do you see bottling contributions as potentially sustainably accretive to total company top line and profit growth over the next couple of years?\nJames Quincey: Let me try and offer three thoughts, Steve. Firstly, I think we have in front of us a tremendous long-term opportunity in the beverage industry. I'd refer you back to one of the pages we've used in one of the investor decks with the two bottles, the one of the developed worlds and the one of the developing worlds. With the developed world is a small portion of the world's population, 20% of the population of the world. Yes, there, 3/4 of what they drink is a commercial beverage, but we still have a relatively small share of that in aggregate and we're gaining share. So, there's huge opportunity for value growth in the developed world. And yet in the developing part of the world, which is 80% of the world population, only 1/4 of what they drink evolves from commercial beverage. And again, our share has lots of room for expansion. So, the first point is I would reunderline the long-term opportunity for growth of commercial beverages in the developed and the developing markets, and that's a huge opportunity in front of us. The second thought I would offer you is I think we're seeing not just momentum in the second quarter or the year-to-date, and yes, leave aside some of the timing benefits, but what we're seeing is a sustained set of results over if you want to take the last four quarters and you average out the unit cases and you average out the price/mix of the last four quarters to just give you a year, I think you get about two in volume and about three in price. And if you were to do the calculation, I think you'd end up with a three on price with or without BIG. So, I think you're seeing sustained momentum of the core business over a 12-month period. And perhaps even more encouragingly, that is now lapping a period where we were also in the band we were looking for, for our long-term growth model of 4% to 6%. So, we've now got 5% in round numbers lapping 5%. So, I think the momentum is now multiyear. I always encourage everyone to look at some multiquarter average given where we are in the supply chain and the timing effects. So long-term opportunities, and we're now building momentum that is called multiyear momentum. And I think to the question of how much BIG can affect that going forward, yes. Look, we've clearly given the BIG team a mission to grow the top line and the bottom line. I think the countries that did well this quarter are -- happened to be the countries where we own the parts of the bottling operation. So that obviously -- that obviously was very helpful. But BIG is centered in a number of countries that have long-term growth prospects. They're largely in the bottle but is only 1/4 commercial beverages. So, they have a lot of opportunity, and we've given them a clear mission to abandon the concept of the hospital ward. We should be aspiring for bottling operations we own to be just as good as all the other bottling operations, and obviously, we'll look to find the right owner at the right time. And therefore, yes, we should expect the BIG operations to do better in the coming years.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: John, you opened up the door crack on 2020 earnings guidance with the benign FX comment. I know you won't give us an explicit guidance range today, but I guess just conceptually, besides FX, are there any big puts or takes we should think about for 2020 versus the typical EPS growth algorithm you've outlined? And also, maybe perhaps you can discuss if FX were to worsen and become more unfavorable from the spot rates where we are today, are there any leverage can pull to offset that from the earnings growth perspective as you look out to 2020.\nJohn Murphy: Yes. No. Thanks, Dara. It's still very early days to talk about 2020. As you know, there's a number of factors that go into how we'll ultimately perform in 2020. The global macro environment continues to be pretty volatile. There's a lot of discussions as to where interest rates will land. And in some of our -- the markets that are particularly important to us, places like Mexico, like Turkey, South Africa, Argentina, there's a lot of moving parts there. So, it's very early to talk about 2020. I do think it's -- it is good to look at 2020 though in the context of currency. We think the dollar is at the -- towards the end of a strong cycle, and hence, we think that we're in for a benign environment over the next year, 1.5 years. With respect to sort of managing the potential headwinds from currency, I think we're starting to connect the dots better across the world between the decisions that need to be taken locally to help us have a more holistic approach to dealing with this topic because it's not going away. We -- the emerging markets represent almost 50% of our PBT. So, in the future, it's going to be a very important topic for us to address even better. So early days yet on that. But certainly, connecting the dots better, and as I said in the call, for the back half of the year, the upside on underlying operating performance is actually helping us to maintain our full year guidance.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the strength in the Asia Pacific segment. It's been pretty good so far first half of the year. And so maybe, James, if you could just dig in a little bit in terms of what's driving that underlying performance, and really what I'm after is, I guess, as we're kind of looking beyond this year, sort of some view of whether or not this type of performance is sustainable.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean clearly, we had a good quarter in Asia Pacific. I think we were somewhat helped by the kind of a later monsoon in India or the later start of the monsoon in India. So, I think one would be cautious in extrapolating one quarter into the future. But clearly, this quarter, we saw good growth in India, good growth in ASEAN, particularly in the Philippines, in Thailand, in Vietnam. We saw some good growth in China. Actually, that was despite deprioritizing some of the low-value water, and we're cycling the best quarter of last year. But I think what is representative of is the long-term continued opportunity for the beverage business. We basically -- most of the money comes in from the Americas, North and South America, Europe and Japan and Australia. But that's a small part of the world's population. Actually, if you take Africa, if you take Indian subcontinent, ASEAN and China, that's the vast majority of the world's population, and we're only getting started. And that's where we're seeing good growth this quarter and we have been seeing it for a while. So, I think it's representative of the long-term opportunity. I wouldn't say let's extrapolate this one quarter, but there's absolutely long-term opportunity in those four large population zones.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.\nAli Dibadj: So, one big controversy for investors around Coke is that as you transitioned from Coca-Cola of old to total beverage company, your margins will be pressured. And so, to zero in from that kind of broad controversy into the quarter, you provided this gross margin and operating margin bridge set of charts. Can you just aggregate please the \"underlying green,\" i.e., positive bar more in terms of cost savings, one, negative sales mix, maybe geographic mix and price/mix, really with an idea of trying to get us comfortable with the sustainability and maybe positive momentum in margins. And particularly this quarter, we saw SG&A as a percent of sales improve, but that overall controversy remains on the margins. And then if I might, just a very quick clarification. You mentioned Coke Energy rolling out to 20 countries by the end of this year. Is the U.S. on that list?\nJames Quincey: So, let me start. I'm not sure there's a controversy at all. I think we've been super clear on what we believe is happening on the operating margins and I think, clearly, there's a couple of things happening here. And I would not all rotate on one quarter because of the movements of gallons and those sorts of things. I'll talk about the first half because that's -- I would prefer to talk about four quarters rather than even two, but let's go in. So, I think our messaging has been very clear: the mechanical changes to the operating income margin happened because of ins and outs, particularly of bottling operations given their very different cost structures and the acquisitions, and I think that's clear on the chart. And I think what you can clearly see is we continue to execute against our game plan to improve operating margins over time. We've been tracking on that towards the target that we had talked about, but given all the confusion, we've removed and had this bridge instead. So ongoing improvement in operating income margin, that's been happening and it's happened again in the second quarter or the first half. It's clearly driven by the sum of the parts. We're getting improved pricing. Yes, some of those are in categories, which have higher cost of goods. But as you can see in the gross profit line, the gross profit basically in the first half was flat yet it was better in just the second quarter, but again, I prefer the longer time frame. So, against the question, will expansion of new categories cause the compression of the gross profit margin, we had previously said yes, it might be a little, but it will be offset by productivity. What you've seen in the first half is it's a wash. We've been able to drive the Coke franchise and the innovation and manage the portfolio such that the net impact on gross margin is a wash, which is a great result. And then obviously, we're getting some flow-through of our ongoing productivity efforts. Just because we haven't announced the new program, we are still focused on using resources effectively in the SG&A on the back -- in the back office and investing wisely with the marketing such that this operating leverage is flowing through into the margin. So, I think the game plan is intact and we're continuing to drive against it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.\nJudy Hong: So, James, I guess, my question is just kind of looking at the coffee and Energy opportunity, and you've laid out the plans for the year in entering some of the newer markets. I guess my question is how do you determine and so what's the criteria in determining which markets to enter as kind of the Phase 1 and then over the next couple of years? And then I think Ali asked about a question about if the U.S. fits into that plan so if you can address that as well.\nJames Quincey: Yes. I mean just starting on the U.S., I mean we haven't -- the markets we haven't announced yet, I mean, we're not going to announce until we're ready. Clearly, we're thinking about the U.S. market and when would be the right timing for Coke Energy. Clearly, it's a big market and a big opportunity. I think, ultimately, the way I would look at it is we've launched in a number of markets and our approach is essentially to launch in markets where we know we have capabilities and a lot of strength and a strong Coke franchise, and therefore, we think would represent a robust good opportunity and that should give us an idea of what -- how well we could do. So, Spain would be an example of that. We have a great franchise in Spain. We have a great on-premise business there with the caf\u00e9s and restaurants. We have strong relationships with the modern trade and a very strong bottler. So, we know that if we do well there, that in strong markets, then we know what that would represent. Then we've also launched it in some of the other emerging markets and some markets that our strengths are not as good as the Spanish end of the spectrum, but it'll give us a range of learnings and experience in different types of environments. And that'll give us, in a way, a set of learnings on the 1.0 of launching Coke Energy from which we can learn. And purely from a rollout perspective and a tactical perspective in something like this, it would probably suit us to have those learnings and have a 2.0 for the U.S., whatever tweaks that may be, whether it's taking the formulation tweaks and the graphic tweaks and the marketing mix tweaks and the execution approach, because it's all about accelerating the learning cycle and driving that forward. So that will be the conceptual approach on how we want to get it done. And that's kind of will be true, whether it's Coke Energy or Coke with coffee. Every time we've done it, we've tried to make sure we learn from the cycle of the 1.0 or 2.0 before we go to the next set of countries. Obviously, that means you need to go back at some point to the initial countries to bring them up to the latest thinking on what can be done. And similarly, for coffee, there, of course, we're looking at which of the formats best establishes the brand and can work. And clearly, we think that rolling out with the express vending machines and being a kind of a beans-and-machines beverage partner to the restaurants and caf\u00e9s and the kind of immediate consumption channels is the way to a kind of drive the brand forward. And ready-to-drink coffee will play a part of that but not necessarily be the first piece.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC.\nNik Modi: James, I was hoping you can just give us some context on the U.S. market. Obviously, the sparkling business is doing quite well. But maybe you could just talk about the still portfolio. I understand there's some kind of gaps and weakness in that portfolio when it comes to the DASANI, POWERADE, Gold Peak. So maybe you can just kind of talk about those brands and kind of what the plans are there to get them back in the right direction.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean, I think, again, I'll talk more about the first half than the second quarter because, of course, you get things bouncing around in the short term. I think on the side where there's more work to be done, the water brands, the mainstream water brands like DASANI we're under pressure a bit so far this year as much as anything due to the expansion of retailer private labels and particularly in the larger formats of number of bottles in a case. So, there's some challenge there. The flip side of that is we continue to do really well with the premium water brands. So, Topo Chico continued its fantastic growth wave, smartwater continued to grow. So, I think you see a diverging set of performance in the water market between the mainstream and the premium water brands. POWERADE, again a bit of Tale of Two Cities. POWERADE, the main brand, has not had a good start to the year, faced some executional issues yet POWERADE Zero's growing, and I know the BODYARMOR is doing well in the Coke system. So again, a bit Tale of Two Cities in the sports drink\u2019s category. In terms of juice, again, it's a bit of a repeat. Minute Maid was flat, slightly soft, but we did really well in some of the new launches. And Simply was growing nicely. So again, I think you see a bit of that contrast between some of the mainstream, in this case, more flattish or slightly negative and growing in the premium, especially off Simply and the smoothie. So, I think you see a little of a dichotomy going on there. And I think it's worth talking about the second half. We really got a good program going into the back half of the year, a lot of focus on media and experiential sampling on some of those still categories whether it's smartwater or POWERADE or Gold Peak and some agreed commercial activities with specific customers and market blitzes on merchandising as to kind of bring those back around. So, I think we'll see a lot of attention and focus on reverting some of those trends going into the back half of the year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie.\nCaroline Levy: James, it would be really helpful if you could sort of walk us around the world. You did mention a bit of softness in Mexico if I'm not mistaken, and you said Brazil was stable even though you did better. And if you just looked at the state of consumer and the friendliness towards U.S. companies with China specifically being part of that question, could you just talk to us a little bit about how you see that around the globe? What's getting significantly better? And if anything's deteriorating? Is the Middle East getting worse, for example?\nJames Quincey: So just going back to -- starting in Latin America where you mentioned -- the Mexico that I mentioned, the little softness in the economy, Mexico, we still grew volume in the second quarter slightly, but we still grew volume in the second quarter in Mexico. So, I think it's more of a generalized concern of the environment. Brazil obviously did well. The Argentinian business suffered again in the second quarter. I think there's a clear macroeconomic environment. We're very focused on what we can do in terms of affordability and execution, but you can't completely outrun a macro crisis. So, we're definitely seeing some of that. So, Argentina was very weak. Middle East, yes, that was negative. Clearly, there's some struggle there across the Middle East and that was negative in the quarter. But then once you get out of that, I think it's a bit kind of the theme of the year, which is the clouds on the horizon don't quite arrive with the storm or the storm doesn't arrive. So yes, when you read the reports and look at the forecasts and listen to the news, you would conclude that things are worse. But there seems to be some calm underneath of that and I think that's what we're seeing. As we've executed against our plan, the macros have not been as bad perhaps as one had feared and that has allowed us to deliver strong operational results, and I think Asia Pacific is one of the examples of that where we continue to do well across a broad number of countries on the basis of great plans.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Congratulations on strong first half results. James, a question on North America. So broadly, three consecutive quarters where volumes have been negative but not very consistent with the industry with pricing that's been put into place. But I guess the other key topic, of course, is that your key competitors ramped investment spending that started last year. This is continuing behind key brands like Pepsi and Mountain Dew and Gatorade. Arguably, to some degree, the strategic changes that they're making in North America will really be sort of a key watch point for investors whether this turnaround is, indeed, going to be successful. So broadly, if you could discuss sort of the competitive environment. And then the second part of that, whether you're comfortable with current investment levels in your portfolio going forward.\nJames Quincey: Yes. I mean, firstly, I think I would say that if competitors are investing in the category behind branding and rational pricing and trying to create value, that is ultimately good news. Yes, it means we have to be on the top of our game, but it's better to be in an industry where there's more consumer demand being created than not. So, I think that's a very important starting point that we think will be beneficial ultimately to the total beverage business in the U.S. In terms of the volume, I mean, the volume was slightly negative in the U.S. I think it's important to remember what we're trying to do in the U.S. business. We're focused on building the consumer engagement, and so a lot of what we've done, particularly in some of the sparkling brands, is have a focus on some of the smaller packages and drive for transaction growth even if that means the volume's flat. We'd love a little bit of positive. But if it's a little bit of negative, that hasn't concerned us because we think we can stabilize the volume in the long term and have the value be created ultimately through the price/mix. So, more price versus volume. Obviously, like to see volume a little bit positive in the case of the U.S., but really sticking with the strategy of driving the consumer interactions, heavy lean on smaller packages. Of course, the portfolio piece that goes with that is some of the Zero Sugars and the reformulation. I think that's what you see turning into the strong revenue growth rates from North America. So, you're seeing North America do consistently over time well in terms of revenue growth, and they're gaining market share across a broad swathe of categories from sparkling to a number of the still categories. So, we think it's a strategy that's working for us. We think the investment levels are good for what we're seeing at the moment. Of course, we constantly review all aspects of the business mix and the variables we control as well especially, and we will go up or down as we believe to be appropriate and necessary.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Sean King with UBS.\nSean King: A question about the expanded launch of alcoholic beverages in Japan. While I recognize there might be market-specific competitor or maybe demographic considerations, why not look to other markets besides Japan?\nJames Quincey: Well, clearly, this one evades a very Japanese logic we talked about when it launched regionally. The competitive set, we can face a set of local competitors in Japan, which operate in a multicategory, not just soft drinks and sparkling and stills, but wine, beer and spirits going to the same customers, and in the case of the Lemon-Do, competing for an occasion and a consumer which heavily overlaps here. So, there's a lot of logic in the context of the Japanese business and what you're seeing is a horizontal distribution expansion in the Japanese business, still very small in the context even our business in Japan. The logic of taking it elsewhere has not been clear for The Coca-Cola Company. Of course, historically, our bottlers have carried beer or been brewers so that in parts of the world where there's some distribution logic that it has been -- there have been relationships with our bottling partners. But the Japanese -- example where we own the brand is the Japanese example, and anything else would need to be considered very carefully and the business logic would be very clear for why we should do something different.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. I actually wanted to circle back to your full year guidance. Obviously, your results so far this year were better than you originally expected given that you increased your top line guidance. So, could you maybe highlight or summarize for us the main drivers of this or essentially what was an upside surprise from your perspective? And then on the second half, comps are still tough, but could you highlight why you expect your organic sales to grow a point or two? Are you just being conservative with your outlook for the back half?\nJames Quincey: Sure. Look, the story I think ultimately follows the trajectory. We had, have and still have going forward a clear strategy with a strong view on what we need to do to capture the opportunity ahead of us, and we started executing that a number of years ago. And we were getting momentum and -- we were getting momentum coming out of '17. We had good result, top line momentum in '18. We did at the beginning of this year like our plans still, but see the macro clouds on the horizon and we're a little more cautious in our guidance in February from a top line point of view. The clouds, as we've talked about, are still there, but the storm never arrived. And so, we did better in the first half. I mean, ultimately, it's a result of executing the right plans and the right place and the headwinds not being there. So, where have we seen the benefit? I think we've seen the benefit across a whole series of places doing that a little bit better, whether it's Asia Pacific or some of the parts of Europe and Africa. So, I think it's the flow-through of execution, but it just wasn't one place. As I talked about on the first question, I really do think of the first half more as a 5 than a 6 and there are lots of ways of getting at that answer whether you like the simple rule of thumb or just taking the average of the unit cases and the average of the price/mix and that gets you five, whether it's two quarters or four quarters or you can get into the minutia or the detail on the timing of the Brexit, gallons and all this sort of stuff. But ultimately, you come to the simple headline answer that it's basically a 5, and it's a 5 cycling other growth rates. So, there's really good momentum there. And then when you count the second half, the clouds are still there. The storm hasn't arrived. We have great plans. We have a strategy and a bottling system with momentum. And so, we think we can see our way through to delivering an underlying five in the second half. Of course, if those timing elements reversed, the reported numbers are going to be slightly softer than that in the second half. But that won't detract from the ultimate conclusion that it's a system that's creating momentum around five with a plan that's working.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about Japan because in the commentary so far that you've offered on Asia, you really highlighted developing and emerging markets. And I think there were supply chain issues in Japan last year that we would have been cycling through. So, if you can just run through kind of what's doing in Japan and why that wasn't called out as being a stronger contributor.\nJames Quincey: Sure. No, Japan was a detractor there in this quarter and for some very specific reasons. Firstly, in the natural disasters last year, one of our important bottling -- one of the important manufacturing facilities of our bottle was knocked out completely last year. So, we lost capacity just as we were starting to grow in the Japanese business, and they're working very hard to install new capacity. They're doing a great job in doing it, but one cannot defeat the laws of physics. And so that's going to be brought online over the course of this year, and that has produced a constraint on the business this year. The second reason, which is super important, is we have taken a pretty broad price increase in Japan in April, the first one in a couple of decades. So that's a big deal. And whilst our competitors did not follow us immediately, they did follow us by the end of the quarter. So of course, there was -- the price of leadership in those circumstances is we suffered a little bit of a volume hit in the second quarter. But of course, as they've gone up, too, we think that, that will normalize. And in the context of capacity constraint, we deprioritized some of the lower-margin water volume. So, some very specific reasons in Japan, but we are focused on making the right decisions to invest and drive the brand going into the future. We've got some improving trends in the vending channel. We've got some product innovation and some packaging and pricing stuff -- more stuff coming through with the digital platform as well. So, we think that these decisions will allow us to start to really get some better results in Japan as the production comes back on track -- production capacity comes back on track as we go into the second half of the year. So, we see it more as -- much more as a point in time, but we believe it was what was needed to be done given the natural disasters and it's the right decisions in terms of setting the business up for the future.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.\nGrant O'Brien: This is actually Grant on for Bill. Just want to touch on free cash flow a little bit. Obviously, you guys are focused on it a little bit more. I understand some of that is timing year-to-date. But just wondering on some of the changes you guys have made and maybe some of the initiatives in place going forward to improve free cash flow conversion and kind of room to run on that.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks. Yes, this is a key area of focus and we've talked about it over the last few months as being such, and there's a number of elements to improving our position as we go forward. One is in the area of working capital. We know that we can do better. We know we have opportunity to -- between where we sit today and where best-in-class is. And in this quarter, we made significant strides with -- in the payables arena, we've delivered almost $600 million of benefits to our working capital number in the quarter. A second area that we've talked about is reducing the amount of onetime cash outflows that have been a key part of the transformation work, particularly with the refranchising in North America. That number is going to decline as we move forward and we saw a little bit of that impacting us in -- favorably in the second quarter. And the third area then would be to get our CapEx, capital expenditures, in line with what we think the run rate should be going forward. That's going to take a little bit longer given the fact that we have taken back for the time being the Philippines and South Africa. And so, in the second quarter, in addition to the working capital improvements, the benefits from timing of cash tax payments in 2018, we did not have them this year. And our capital expenditure flow for the year is weighted more in the back half. So good progress on working capital, some timing benefits in the quarter. But as we look to the second half of the year, we are very confident that we'll deliver the free cash flow guidance that we've given.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Well done this quarter, everybody. I guess first on two things. One on Coke Energy now that it's been in the market for a little bit. Can you give us some context on source of volume? Is it really coming from Red Bull as I think you guys have mentioned? And then is any of the growth coming from outside of Energy? And then the second question, John, I don't remember your words exactly, but I believe you said you felt the dollars coming to the end of a strong cycle, and I'm just curious if there's something you're seeing that you could provide to help us kind of understand that comment.\nJohn Murphy: Sure. Let me start with the second point. When you take a step back and you look at dollar cycles over the last 20 or 30 years, the current cycle is the longest one we've had, number one. And when you look at the -- both the macro indicators over the next 12 to 24 months plus some of the political commentary that has been in play around the world, it does point to us being at the high end of dollar strength. And hence, my comments on the environment as we look at it today based on both spot rates and the outlook that we see through a number of lenses to be a benign environment in 2020.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.\nJames Quincey: Thank you, everyone. Just to summarize again, bottling system is working very hard with us. We're aligned. We're delivering improved execution. We're seeing strong performance across our collective business. And we're making good progress not just in the near-term, but for our long-term goals. So as always, thank you for your interest and your investment in the company and for joining us today. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program, and you may all disconnect.

Finally, during today's call, when our senior executives refer to comparable performance, they're referring to comparable performance from continuing operations. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first, and then reenter the queue. Now, let me turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks Tim and good morning everyone. 2019 is off to a good start with strong underlying performance as we leverage our transformation as a total beverage company. We continue to win in a growing industry. The non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry grew value 4% in the quarter and we gained global value share with a balanced contribution from most developed and emerging markets led by strong performance within our sparkling soft drink business. During the quarter, we delivered 6% organic revenue growth, cycling 5% last year. Growth was broad-based with positive performance across each of our operating segments. Of course there are often timing impacts on a quarterly basis and we did see a net benefit in this quarter which John will cover in more detail. But to be clear, we delivered strong topline growth in the quarter which we converted into 16% comparable currency-neutral operating income growth and comparable EPS was up 2%, which was comprised of 13% comparable currency-neutral EPS growth, partially offset by an 11% currency headwind. So, our disciplined growth strategies are working well and we're on track to deliver our full year guidance. As you know our industry continues to evolve and our approach to addressing this encompasses our system acting with discipline to drive growth. First, innovating and investing in our core categories and brands as well as in emerging spaces. This encompasses everything from massive categories like hot beverages to emerging ones like Kombucha and it allows us to proactively address innovation opportunities that stem from blurring category lines. Second, we're looking at how we operate as a company from our existing geographic segments to our new Global Ventures segment. Third, our system is aligned and engaged with improved execution. Our bottling partners are investing for growth including cold-drinks equipment and incremental feet on the street as well as implementing more segmented revenue growth strategies. At the same time, we're investing in digital capabilities. We engage with consumers, interact with our customers, and reduced costs across our enterprise. So, starting with our brands, constant innovation is crucial for sustained growth. Brand Coke, which includes our flagship product and its many variants, has momentum because it has been continually updated to maintain its relevance. Over the past three years, innovation has helped accelerate global retail value growth each year including up to 6% growth in 2018. This growth is in large part because of the success of Coke Zero Sugar which didn't happen of course overnight. We refined and expanded Zero Sugar over time and we see more growth ahead. Coke Zero Sugar succeeds because it builds on the brand edge of original Coke, on its taste, its upliftment, on the energy boost that the product provides, all these in a product that doesn't have calories or sugar. So, what's next for brand Coke? You will see us to continue to innovate to capture additional consumption occasions and need states. One example that I've talked about before is Coca-Cola coffee which we tested in several Asian markets last year. Coke coffee was designed to reach consumers during specific occasions and channels like the mid-afternoon energy slump at work. We've learned from these pilots and we now plan to launch in more than 25 markets around the world by year end. We're also pursuing another logical extension on the Coca-Cola brand with our test of Coke Energy. This takes one of the original brand edges of Coke, its energy boost, to a new level and a new taste. This product is designed to the white spaces where the energy category isn't well-developed. But our approach to innovation is not limited to brand Coke. We're taking other brands and pushing into new spaces to offer consumers what they want by leveraging the brand edges. For example, Innocent, our leading juice business in Europe, expanded into plant-based beverages. And within our Challenger brand, Simply, our premium juice brand in the U.S. recently launched a new line of smoothies. We're also improving the way we operationalize our innovation pipeline. Within our Explorer brands, almost half of our country category combinations are growing volume double-digits, which is up from about a third a year ago. While we often talk about innovating in products, our evolution is just as much about changing how we work. Our organizational needs are ever-changing, as our portfolio and competitive environment become more complex around the world. So we're adapting. One example is the creation of a new operating group Global Ventures. The goal is to accelerate some of our businesses, like Innocent and Costa Coffee that have the potential for growth across traditional borders. While the acquisition of Costa Coffee plays a significant entry point into hot beverages, it's also more than that. Costa is a platform in coffee overall. This requires more and better connectivity than ever before. We spent the first three months ensuring the transition from Whitbread went smoothly while building connections within our existing business units. And Costa is performing in line with expectations. As we look to the second quarter, we'll be launching our first ready-to-drink Costa products; expect to hear more about that in the weeks ahead. Turning now to our geographic performance, we saw good results in many markets around the world. Our emerging and developing markets are growing organic revenue double-digits. And our developed markets are performing well, delivering mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. In EMEA, we grew organic revenue 14%, driven by continued growth in Europe and Turkey, and improved performance in Russia. We also benefited from our European bottlers increasing their inventory levels as a safeguard for a potentially disruptive Brexit. Across Europe, revenue growth management initiatives and Zero Sugar innovations are creating sustained momentum in the majority of our markets. Not only has this benefited price/mix, but unit case volume was up 4% for our European sparkling soft drink portfolio. This performance is balanced with growth in our tea and hydration categories as we broaden out the portfolio. Turning to North America, our results continue to mount steady progress driven by strong marketing and execution. Organic revenue was unfavorably impacted by 2 points for one less day in the quarter and the Easter shift, and grew 1% driven by disciplined price pack management and solid value growth within sparkling soft drinks, juice drinks, and value-added dairy. Our sparkling portfolio benefited from the continued strong performance in Coke Zero Sugar and new flavor innovations like Orange Vanilla Coke, which helped drive 6% retail value growth for brand Coca-Cola in our flagship markets. Unit case volume declined by 1% in North America as we continued to focus on providing consumers with smaller pack sizes, for example, mini cans grew 14% in the quarter contributing to transactions and our [pacing] [ph] volume while driving significant value for our system and our customers. In Latin America, we delivered 6% organic revenue growth in an increasingly difficult operating environment. Argentina's economic environment worsened, the high inflation increased the salary gap and impacted private consumption. The volume here declined double-digits, but we gained value and volume share by adjusting the price pack architecture focused on transactions and maintaining our consumer base. In Mexico, we're working with our bottling partners to ensure our revenue growth management initiatives continue to drive momentum. And Brazil, Brazil is on upward trajectory. Our turnaround plan is working with volume up 5% and transactions up double-digits in the quarter. Incremental cooler placements and increased availability of our refillable packages are helping to drive this acceleration. Finally, in Asia Pacific, we saw good performance in China and India along with accelerating momentum in our Southeast Asia business unit, which drove 4% organic revenue growth for the segment overall. Execution around Chinese New Year was strong, contributing to 9% volume growth and double-digit transaction growth in China. In Japan, our system continues to deal with the supply chain impact from natural disasters last year. Manufacturing capacity remains tight, but is improving, with additional lines ramping up in the second quarter. So we expect this to ease the capacity shortage, but full recovery will take until next year. In Japan, unit case volume was even. New product launches drove momentum in tea and coffee during the first quarter while we cycle the benefit of a strong innovation pipeline in sparkling soft drinks last year. So, in summary, we had a good start to the year. Our strategy of being more consumer focused and creating value for our customers is working. And we are confident we will deliver our full year targets and drive shareholder value. I'll now turn the call over to John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Today, I'd like to cover three topics. One, our financial results in the quarter; two, our outlook for the remainder of the year; and three, I'd like to say a few points on our currency hedging program. So starting with our financial performance in the quarter. As James said, we got off to a good start to the year. You'll see that, the composition of organic revenue growth in the first quarter was the inverse of what we saw last year driven more by price/mix than volume. Price/mix was 5%, cycling 1% and trending ahead of our recent run rate driven by strong price/mix in North America, EMEA and Latin America. Our concentrate shipments grew 1%, cycling 4%, adversely impacted by one less day in the quarter. Of course with a portfolio as diverse as ours there will often be variability in timing from quarter-to-quarter. The largest timing impact we saw was in Europe, where our bottlers increased safety stock in advance of a potentially disruptive Brexit. This benefited both global price/mix and concentrate shipments, since Europe comprises high revenue per case markets. After normalizing for the estimated two points timing benefit and impact from one less day in the quarter the best way to think of the underlying top line performance in the first quarter is 5%. Over the remainder of 2019, we expect a more balanced volume and price/mix. Importantly, I'm really encouraged by our organic performance in the first quarter and the sustainability of that growth going forward. Turning now to margins for both growth and operating margins, we delivered another quarter of underlying margin expansion. In line with our expectations, our geographic groups were the primary driver, a function of continued innovation, revenue growth management, strategies and the effect of management of our cost structure. However, comparable margins contracted in the quarter due to the impact of acquisitions and currency. At the gross profit level, we saw underlying gross margin expand about 30 basis points. Currencies and net acquisitions impacted gross margin by about 100 basis points and 80 basis points respectively. This was expected with the impact from net acquisitions driven, primarily by bottler transactions within our bottling investments segment. At the operating profit level, a continued focus on productivity as well as the timing of certain expenses drove a 240 basis point expansion in underlying operating margin. But this was offset by about 130 basis point impact from currencies and about 130 basis point impact from net acquisitions. As James noted, comparable EPS growth grew 2% in the quarter which was comprised of 13% comparable currency-neutral growth, partially offset by an 11% currency headwind. Finally, we generated free cash flow of $335 million in the quarter in line with our expectations. Strong underlying cash generation was offset by the impact of currency headwinds along with an increase in capital expenditures and cash tax payments. Looking now at the remainder of the year. We are confident we can deliver the full year guidance we have spoken about previously and is included in our release. We do expect the quarterly phasing to be a bit uneven. So let me just highlight some considerations to factor into your models. The timing benefit we received from bottlers stocking up in anticipation of Brexit was roughly $0.02 into the first quarter EPS. But as we move forward, we expect this to reverse this year. This is a fluid situation, but our current estimate is that our bottlers will hold their safety stock through the second and third quarter. So for modeling purposes I would take the $0.02 out of the fourth quarter. Before giving a currency outlook, I'd like to highlight a few points. Since CAGNY, we've taken a close look at how we manage foreign exchange in over 70 functional currencies. For developed market currencies, I believe we have the right hedging strategy to mitigate fluctuations to cash flows. This approach has provided a significant cash flow benefit over the past five years, which is important for our company given our large domestic cash obligations including the dividend. Our challenge is emerging market currencies given the increasing importance of emerging markets to our earnings base. While we have not underperformed versus other approaches there has been a limited amount we can do to hedge this exposure in a cost-efficient manner. Going forward we will continue to evaluate our approach to optimally manage this area. We'll provide insight if and when that approach evolves. I'd also like us to a better job on overall communications. So going forward in quarters where it is significant, we will begin calling out hedging as a component of the overall currency impact so it's clear what gains or losses, we'll be cycling next year. For example in the first quarter of 2019, the currency impact to operating income was not materially affected by hedging activities and is primarily the result of a change in spot rates. We will also provide preliminary currency outlook for the following year once we have better insight into our hedging activity for the latter year. I expect this to be on the third quarter earnings call. Returning to our near-term outlook. In the second quarter, we expect a 7 point currency impact to operating income. This includes a 2 point impact from hedging activity driven almost entirely by gains we are cycling from the prior year. We are hedged through options near current market rates for the G10 currencies as well as for certain emerging market currencies. So we have downside protection in the quarter and some upside opportunities should the dollar weaken. As we move into the back half of the year, we expect the impact from currencies to become less of a headwind each quarter. However, while we are hedged on the hard currencies through the end of 2019, we do have some exposure to fluctuations in emerging market currencies and our currency outlook will reflect this accordingly. As always our Investor Relations team will be happy to answer any questions as you build-out your models for the year. So in summary, organic revenue growth is strong and is broad-based. Currency and acquisitions impacted margins in the quarter, but pricing and productivity are driving underlying margin expansion. And we are confident in our ability to deliver our full year guidance. Operator, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nSteve Powers: Great. Thanks. Good morning.\nJames Quincey: Good morning.\nSteve Powers: I guess -- James, congrats on the quarter. I think the prepared remarks gave a lot of clarity. I wanted to start actually stepping back and talking about a bigger picture issue, just in terms of innovation. You've talked a lot about incremental innovation, I mean, how you work and how you introduce new products since you've taken over as CEO. And about the need to try more not be afraid of failure, but also when you do fail to -- fail fast and fail cheaply. And I guess my question is as you step back, just how do you assess your progress against those innovation objectives? You cited some things in the prepared remarks that have shown promise. But what metrics are you specifically tracking when it comes to innovation? And maybe if you could, could you share some of those with us? Is it simply a matter of accelerating the number of new product innovations and introductions? And if so have those in fact accelerated? Or are there other metrics in terms of success rates or product contributions to growth or the balance of innovation across categories and geographies? Just a little bit more context around how you're approaching the measurement of innovation success?\nJames Quincey: Sure. Let me offer you a couple of thoughts, Steve. I think one is to -- one metric that we track, and I think, we've put some numbers in our CAGNY presentation if I remember correctly, is looking at the contribution of innovation to overall volume or revenue growth or gross margin growth. So just tracking quite simply what was existing and what was new and what's contributing to the base. And that is useful to us not just to know what's new and what's existing, but on the thesis that the most important thing is to work out how to stay relevant there are innovations which are about new products, but there are innovations about marketing and packaging, which is all aimed to help us stay relevant. So innovation shouldn't be seen just as narrowly as the physical liquid product. It needs to be also seen as the packaging and the marketing. So we do measure the narrow, which is the product but we're also [interested] [ph] in the broad. And ultimately what that ladders up to is driving the framework we've talked about, which is the leader, challenger, explorer and the zombies. So in the end, the innovations in the product, the packaging, the marketing, the execution, the co-brand it's all about getting more quality leadership positions. And so we're measuring there how many of the leaders are growing faster than personal consumption. Are they expanding their leadership position? How many of the challengers are gaining a decent amount of value share each year, because if they don't gain a decent amount of value share each year, they'll never arrive at being leader. And how many of the explorers are growing double-digits? We called out in the scriptures then that with half the explorers are growing double-digits, so there was only one-third last year. So innovation should be seen as in service of creating quality leadership for the brands and that's the highest level metric that we look at in the end.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks, good morning.\nJames Quincey: Hey, Lauren.\nLauren Lieberman: The volume performance in Asia was really notable this quarter. And so I know in the release you mentioned China, Southeast Asia and India. But could you just walk through specifically what's driving the performance? Even like just talk about it in a sequential acceleration. And also I'm sure it's quite small, but you did mention this authentic tea house launch in China. And I just know that's been a tough country category combination for you historically. So if you could just comment on that, because if you put it in the release it must be worth talking about. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yeah. Okay. I think the first thing I would say is that the Asia Pacific volume growth in the first quarter was very much in line with the volume growth in 2018. I think the question that was out there was in the fourth quarter when it softened a little was that a blip or was that the emergence of something else? And I think at least with the first quarter, the fourth quarter looks more like a blip. So I think it's a retaking of the momentum we have in 2018. Specifically what was driving it was, for example, in China we had very strong performance by the whole Coca-Cola trademark, as well as emphasizing single serve water and the recreating value in the water category that has been an ongoing theme for us in the China business. Obviously all of that was wrapped together with a good Chinese New Year. Tremendous activation on the marketing programs there. So, really a solid quarter by the Chinese business. In India, we did well, good performance by the sparkling but we also had in the case of India really strong growth in the juices. Maaza, which is the local mango centered juice business, was up very strongly along with some of the Minute Maid local Indian fruit flavors, so a nice performance there. We also saw Southeast Asia do better. Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam they were all in double-digits, so a really good performance across Southeast Asia. And Authentic Tea House, I know it made it into the release and I think it's starting to continue to do well. So we are pleased with the initial results. It's going to be a very -- it's definitively in the category of explorer. So it's growing. But I think there's a long, long road to go before we are happy with where we end up in tea in China.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nBonnie Herzog: All right Thank you, good morning. So I had a question on your margins. The underlying margins were quite impressive in the quarter ex FX and acquisitions. So I was hoping you could help bucket some of the key drivers behind the strength in the quarter. And then maybe give us a sense as to how much of the benefit you got from productivity savings versus the lift you might be getting from some of the strong pricing you're seeing? Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you. Let me start with a quick walk forward on gross margin first and then I'll cover operating margin. As I mentioned in my remarks, the underlying margin expansion of what's 30 basis points in gross margin was led by EMEA. And the benefits of Brexit was clearly part of that, but there was also a positive benefit of geographical mix overall. And this was partially offset by North America due to growth in the finished good businesses. I think importantly, we need to take into account the currency headwinds and they were particularly related to the Argentinean peso. And we also were cycling some hedge gains from prior year. In addition to which we also had a structural impact mainly driven by the acquisition of the Philippines bottling business. And there was a slight offset there on the kind of the bottler refranchising. On the operating margin front, the underlying expansion of 250 basis points was due to EMEA and the Brexit impact where we have a higher revenue and would've had no expenses there and North America also due to productivity in the -- across-the-board and the timing of some expenses. We also saw though the headwinds on operating margin on the acquisition front and the currency headwinds due to the peso and hedging gains I mentioned before. So underlying margin expansion net positive, but purely been impacted by the headwinds on currency and acquisitions.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nQ \u2013 Judy Hong: Thank you. Good morning. So James, I guess I'm just trying to get a little bit more color just in terms of your organic revenue growth outlook for the full year. I think in the fourth quarter call, you talked about some of the cautions around some of the macroeconomic volatility in markets like Middle East and Argentina. It seems like first quarter certainly came in a little bit better even setting aside some of the timing noise. So how are you thinking about the 4% number? Do you feel like there's maybe some cushion as you kind of think about the volatility perhaps being a little bit less or certain markets actually doing a little bit better than you thought? Thank you.\nA \u2013 James Quincey: Sure. I mean, I think firstly, it's certainly encouraging to come out of the gate in the first quarter with a strong start. And as you say taking the timing aside, I think we can call the first quarter a five. It's obviously our smallest quarter. So there's still a long way to go in the rest of 2019. And I think it's still a question of the macros versus what we can execute against ourselves very much as it was in the last call. I think since we last spoke, the IMF has come out and reduced its forecast for the year again. So I think the macro environment remains of a lower level of growth than it was in 2018 and a degree of uncertainty as to how some of the bigger issues around trade are going to play out. Depending on the week, it can be blowing a little. We're optimistic, a little more pessimistic, but I think fundamentally, the macro environment remains very similar to what we have been planning against for the last number of months. Obviously what we are focused on is the execution against our strategy. We think we have a strategy that's right for the consumers and the customers for 2019 and well into the future. We and the bottling partners are focused on executing against that. We're going to have to deal with the ups and downs in some of the trickier parts of the world whether that's Argentina or the Middle East or other places that are under pressure. But we think we have a plan that's going to work. So I think in the end, it comes down to. We are confident in our guidance. We had a good start in the first quarter, although it's the smallest quarter. And we will continue to focus on managing what we can manage to deliver a good result in 2019.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nQ \u2013 Ali Dibadj: Hey guys. So I was just wondering about the SG&A improvement. It looked pretty strong in the quarter, notwithstanding some of the gross margin impact and FX impact. What's underlying that in particular given a little bit of detail John a moment ago? But I guess, I ask in the context of the $3.8 billion restructuring target that was set a few years ago and whether there's an opportunity to up that number. It certainly seems like you have more room there understanding a lot of moving parts. And then, the second thing is related to Coke Energy. You mentioned it James in your opening remarks. Do you have any detail further about the opportunities there? That would be helpful as well. Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks. Ali on SG&A, we had a slight increase in comparables at 1.1% and there's a couple of things in there. One, it does reflect the integration of the new businesses, but it's offset by currency and the structural impact. So, when you look at the comparisons take those into account. We did have some savings in SG&A during the quarter, a benefit of the ongoing productivity work that we have been doing, plus some timing of expenses in North America. And as we look to the future, I quote our ongoing work on productivity in under the whole margin expansion arena, where we would be embedding into just the way we operate a critical focus across the enterprise on driving costs at every line our cost to sales line. We see opportunities to continue to drive, or concentrate supply business more efficiently through harmonization of formulas et cetera. There is ongoing opportunity in the OpEx arena, to drive more efficiency particularly with some of the digitization initiatives we have underway. And then finally, there's always ways to I think be more effective and efficient, with our marketing spend and that's a key area of focus going forward across the enterprise.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open.\nBill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning.\nJames Quincey: Good morning.\nBill Chappell: Could you talk a little more on the innovation especially on the coffee side? Just trying to understand, I guess one how the Coke coffee works with Costa? And also, kind of timing of some of these launches? Will they be in North America? Will they have an impact in 1Q, 2Q, 3Q? Just a little more color on how that flows through the year would be helpful. Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I think firstly, the way we are seeing the opportunities for innovation in a product sense is in a way at the blurring edge or partly at the blurring edge with some of the categories. So the opportunity to have a Coke and coffee variant of Coca-Cola is really at that juncture of what are the benefits that people see in Coke versus what are the benefits they look for in coffee, especially perhaps in some of the markets where the occasions are less well-developed. Said another way, in the developed economies three-quarters of what people drink is already a commercial beverage. So they have a certain view as to what drinks go for what and what occasions. But in the emerging economies only a quarter of what they drink is a commercial beverage. So there's still a lot of in a way creating of the occasions and connecting of brands and benefits to certain occasions. So, there is opportunities to expand categories and to leverage the blurring of the edges. And I think Coke coffee is a great example of that, started out in Southeast Asia in that afternoon slump, and really married the benefits of Coke with coffee in a very unique way and has done most. And there's nothing about that that detracts from some of the more direct coffee drinks that we launched. Obviously, we've got Georgia coffee, we've got some other coffee drinks in the U.S. with partners, and we see a great opportunity to bring Costa ready-to-drink to the marketplace. We will be doing that later in the second quarter. So as we do that, of course, it's likely that will be concentrated in the markets where Costa already is and we'll be coming up with that later in the second quarter. And then as for how we foresee the rollout of the coffee platform not just the ready-to-drink, but the vending and being a beverage partner with beans and machines that we'll come back to later in the year as we have time to really solidify the expansion plans with the management of Costa. Obviously, we closed the acquisition well ahead of schedule. The integration has gone well and is ahead of schedule taking the business and the services out of Whitbread and connecting them to the Coke system. And we're currently working through the various stages of the synergy plans we see ahead.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, good morning everyone.\nJames Quincey: Good morning.\nBryan Spillane: John I guess just a couple of questions, balance sheet-related questions for you. One is, if you look at the, I guess, long-term debt in the quarter went up and even net debt went up. And I know part of that is with the Costa acquisition. But it was a little surprised to see net debt that was going up. So if you could just talk about kind of the evolution of the balance sheet and debt balances going forward, first? Then second, just related to your comments earlier on currency hedging. Can you just give us a high-level view of what the trade-offs are? So hedging -- the currency hedging has been a part of Coke for a long time. So if you decided not to do it, I guess, with the emerging market currencies just what's the trade-off? What benefit do you derive from doing it now that you might have -- you might give up, if you'd change the policy going forward?\nJohn Murphy: Okay. Let me start with the balance sheet question and just a few key highlights from the quarter. First of all, our cash, our balance is slightly lower and that was driven by the acquisition of Costa. We saw an increase in our non-current assets $7.2 billion also driven by Costa and CHI. And that's affecting two line items. One is, the intangibles increased by $5.5 billion. And secondly, there was an increase of $0.5 billion in our plants and equipment line. We do have lower short-term debt balances driven by lower commercial paper balances. In the first quarter, we did issue a long-term euro debt, which combined with those lower cash balance that I mentioned is driving net debt slightly higher. So our net debt-to-EBITDA is at 2.7x slightly above our target of 2.5x. But we do expect to get that back to within range. So that's on the balance sheet. With respect to the hedging questions, I think, there's a couple of points to consider. First of all, we -- when you look at why we do it in the first place and why we've taken the approach, we've taken, we know we have U.S. cash outgoings slated in the course of the year. And then it's important for us that we have certainty with respect to the inflows in order to cover those obligations. So having that certainty is really important and is a key factor. Historically, we've also wanted to smooth the impact over time periods. And when you take the long view on that, I think the treasury team has done a really good job on it. We did -- over the last few weeks, we did actually take a look at what would have happened over the last 10 years if we had deployed other approaches. And for developed currencies, I think the hedging program we have in place by far delivered a better outcome than if we had done nothing or if we had been sort of more inactive in this area. The area and I mentioned it in my remarks, the area that's a challenge will be working with our emerging currency portfolio. And as you know the cost of hedging, the more volatile currencies sometimes is not worth doing. And we don't have, I don't think anybody has actually a perfect model or system to cover the risks implicit in, filling in a more volatile emerging currency. So that's an area that we will continue to work on. In the short to medium term, we do have some positions, which we believe are prudent and again give us more certainty in the short-term and allow us to minimize the downside.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nJames Quincey: Hi, Andrea.\nPeter Grom: Hi, good morning, everyone. This is Peter Grom on for Andrea.\nJames Quincey: Hi, Peter.\nPeter Grom: So I just wanted to ask a quick follow-up on Coke Energy. So James in the prepared remarks you talked about launching in white spaces where the energy category is not yet developed. Is that more looking at specific countries across the world? Or are you speaking to maybe a particular sub-segment of the category that you think is underdeveloped? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yeah. I mean, Coke Energy the -- again this is something that debase the dynamic of the blurring of some of the categories and the boundary between some of the categories. So there's -- with every category in energy is no different. There's a very core to the category, a central proposition that everyone understands the category to be. And then as the boundary of the category people have made innovations by adding other ingredients and starting to connect to benefits from other categories. And in the case of the energy category there has been a lot of growth in the central core of what the category stands for and that's what's propelled the category forward in largely North America and Europe and a few other parts of the world. The energy category in itself is still in development in many emerging markets. And, therefore, there's an opportunity in complement to the core brands within the energy category to work at the boundary. And Coke Energy is based on that dynamic. I mean, it's got the credentials and some of the origins to be able to connect to some of the energy need states. So we see that as a space where the energy category can grow. And we see that across our whole series of geographies. And we're going to experiment with Coke Energy and see how it works and then, obviously, refine the proposition. And we think it will help complement the other brands that sell successfully in this category.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nBrendan Metrano: Good morning. This is Brendan Metrano for Robert. John, a quick follow-up for you. Could you quantify the benefit to gross and operating margin from that concentrate build in EMEA? And then for James, I'm wondering if you could expand on trends in Brazil and Mexico and some of the initiatives that you're implementing in those markets. Brazil seems to be turning for a while. The staples company in Mexico is, obviously, an important business for you guys. Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: Okay. Let me take the Brexit question. Yes, the timing benefit to margins on Brexit was 70 basis points in the quarter.\nBrendan Metrano: And that was for gross and operating?\nJohn Murphy: Operating.\nBrendan Metrano: Operating?\nJohn Murphy: Yes.\nJames Quincey: We'll give everyone a shot at the questions before we come back to the second one. Is there someone else?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hey, good morning guys. I wanted to ask a little bit for a little more detail on the Coke brand. And maybe specifically you've had Coke Zero Sugar for a period of time. Now you have orange and coffee and energy. How do you know you're not overextending the brand and maybe the underlying business becomes less stable and a lot more reliant on the newest innovations?\nJames Quincey: Yeah. Great question. I think there's a difference between what's central to the brand and what are innovations that are likely to be either in or out or in a way noncore to the identity or the most central part of the brand. And so I would see brand Coke and what it stands for, and therefore Coke Zero Sugar as a key part of what the Coca-Cola brand is. Now things like coffee that's at the beginning we'll see how that develops. Clearly, that's a product variant that's crossing over into another category with coffee. And obviously, there is a danger there as you say that it becomes -- it starts to change the nature of Coke itself. Orange and Vanilla, I think is a flavor. We've had some history with flavors. Whether it will ultimately end up proving to be one of those ones that endures and is available in the market that doesn't get support or not time will tell. There are a number of them and they are different in different countries. And I think they add some interest and some connection to the brand. But they are ultimately not marketed in that sense and really driven by availability. In the end, what we have to steward is the vibrancy of the total brand. And of course, those variants that make up the core of the brand. We do that through a whole series of metrics, whether it be consumer metrics or in-market metrics. And I think that is a key challenge and an imperative, not just for the brand teams, but for the management as well.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge. Your line is now open.\nBrett Cooper: Good morning. I was wondering if you guys can talk about the process of expanding information or innovation from the original market, particularly interested in whether it is pushed from the center and pulled from the country. And then, what happens between test and further rollout? And I guess the final thing is just can you talk about the speed of doing that? And is that where you want it to be? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Well I think the nature of being in CEO or in corporate management is nothing is ever as fast as you'd like it, but that's a challenge on how to improve its speed rather than something you can live with philosophically. I think look the reality is that you get a bit of everything. When there's a successful innovation in a market there's a very high likelihood that one of the neighboring markets will have seen it and moved on it before anyone from the center needs to say anything. In the end, we have to set up a system that allows that. Why? Because it's impossible for an enterprise as large as Coke to have everything directed from the center. It's just not possible to know everything and it's not possible to issue enough instructions to all the different markets. The system has to rely on the center focusing on the highest-leverage decisions. That could be moving in innovation around the world or ensuring that an innovation stay in a certain form. But it tends to be directed at a few big decisions and then a focus on talent and culture and a system that can allow an organic amount of self-generation. So to take the example we've talked about so far today Coke with coffee. That started out in Asia Pacific. They came up with one variant. The next market then started to move on it before it was really something that the seller was worrying about or looking at. They actually then updated the formula, so it already went from 1.0 to 2.0 by the time it went to the second country based on some of the learnings. And then as it got moved out further, yes, there have been further evolutions of the formula. Obviously, one of the things we've done from the Corporate Center is try to make sure there's some unity in how the variant is being thought about and how the formulas are being developed. Because ultimately, we have to push against the trend that every market thinks it necessarily has to make the thing better and that we'd end up with 200 versions of everything. It doesn't have to be one version, but 200 is also probably the wrong answer. And so we do apply a process of pressure to get into a corridor that we believe is appropriate to both satisfy local consumer differences, yet drive the growth of a global brand and an efficiency of an overall supply chain.\nBrett Cooper: Thank you.\nJohn Murphy: And I'd just add -- if I add one additional comment. Just from my experience over the last couple of years, Brett is that I think we've moved from more of a hub and spoke model to a network model. Our R&D center is now reporting into local operations. We have one in Shanghai, Tokyo, Brussels and Mexico. And they're very much wired together and connected to our business units. So the speed at which stuff is moving around has increased a lot over the last two years, not for what we would ideally want it to be, but it's certainly a key part of the overall profit that James just referenced.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.\nLaurent Grandet: Good morning, James. Good morning, John. I'd like to focus on Coke Energy again. I mean, could you please update us on the Coke Energy launch in Europe? The reception from bottlers and retailers and maybe already from consumers? If sales are incremental to the Coke franchise or if it's taking share from competition? Any update on upcoming launches outside of Europe? That will help. Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yeah. Sure. I think that the headline unfortunately Laurent is too early to tell. It's only really just gone \u2013 it's only really just been launched. The first sales are only just being made. It seems to have resonated well in the first couple of weeks. And so given how early on it is, it's not \u2013 we're not at the stage where we can really make a good call on where are the incremental sales coming from. So they're still small at this stage. So I think it's very \u2013 it's too early to tell. Obviously, we'll be looking at it in the coming weeks and months, and we'll be able to become clearer as we go forward.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDrew Levine: Hi, everyone. This is Drew Levine on for Amit. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about the competitive environment in the U.S. Your main competitor said that, they are at least not losing share on their cola brand anymore. So I just wanted to see what you're seeing in the market, if you're happy with your market share performance in cola. And then kind of related to that in sports drinks any plans to expand the scope of BODYARMOR or additional support for the sports drinks given some plans by your competitor to increase spending on their own brand? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yeah. We've got a good strategy in the U.S. focused on investing in the brands, building out the portfolio, working with the new network of bottlers post refranchising to execute the strategy in the marketplace with a packaging approach a smaller packaging. We have a standing strategy in the U.S. that has been successful in allowing us to help the industry to grow for our customers, and for us to be able to gain share within that total industry, and that again played out in the first quarter this year. So we think it's a \u2013 our strategy that works for us. Obviously, as other parties large or small invest in the industry, I think it says two things. One it says, the industry is attractive, because it's got growth and profitability. That's why people want to enter. And it says, we need to up our game because the industry is going to become more competitive. And I think that's in the end good news for The Coca-Cola Company and it certainly has been over the last number of years in North America. We've been focused on driving sparkling beverages and that's continuing to do well, particularly our Coke Zero Sugar. BODYARMOR had a good start in the sports drinks category. It's certainly been one of the things that's been driving growth in that category. So we're going to continue to invest. We're going to stick to our overall game plan. And we'll focus on working to make our brands as relevant for consumers and our plans as value creating for the customers, so we can remain competitive in this attractive industry.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session for today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any further remarks.\nJames Quincey: Thank you everyone for joining the call today. To conclude, we had a solid start to the year. We've capitalized on our momentum coming out of 2018 and we'll continue to drive our strategies for the remainder of the year. We remain confident. We will deliver our full year guidance. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us today. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day."}], "2021": [{"symbol": "KO", "quarter": 4, "year": 2020, "date": "2021-02-10 13:25:47", "content": "Operator: At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Coca-Cola Company's Fourth Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] All participants will be on listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors and therefore questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Leveridge, Vice President and Investor Relations, Financial Planning and Analysis. Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.\nTim Leveridge: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that we posted schedules under the Financial Reports and Information tab in the Investors section of our company website at www.coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. I'd also like to note that you can find additional materials in the Investors section of our company website that provide the accompanying slides for today's discussion and an analysis of our margin structure. In addition, this conference may contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent SEC report. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first and then re-enter the queue. Now, I will turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin today's call by reflecting on the past year including our fourth quarter performance. Then, let's turn the page and look at the New Year. I'll provide thoughts on the current environment and how we will continue to manage through near term volatility. Finally, I will share how we're thinking about the year ahead and why we remain confident about the future. John, will then discuss the quarter and our outlook in more detail. Now before we dive in, I'd like to address our U.S. income tax dispute with the Internal Revenue Service, including both the case and the opinion that was issued by the U.S. Tax Court in November. We believe that the tax court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable regulations in its conclusions. We intend to assert our claims on appeal and vigorously defend our position. We've consulted with outside advisors, and conducted comprehensive analysis. We've considered all relevant information including the unconstitutionality of the IRS's retroactive imposition of tax liability. Putting this all together, we believe we will ultimately prevail on appeal. John will provide insight into the range of risks we see, should the case not go in our favor. I also encourage you to refer to Exhibit 99.2 in the Form 8-K we filed this morning for the updated disclosure. The tax matter is clearly important, and we are dedicating ample resources to its resolution, but it is likely to take some time. We remain steadfastly focused on delivering growth in our business, and driving long-term value for our stakeholders. In 2020, we faced significant challenges posed by the global pandemic. Our company proved resilience, moving with agility to adapt our business and accelerate our strategic transformation. Our work isn't done. And I recognize and appreciate the ongoing support, dedication and progress from our people and our system. Turning to the fourth quarter, we saw improving trends through November, but a resurgence in the virus drove renewed lockdowns in many parts of the world. The rise in restrictions impacted our recovery in many markets, resulting in a modest deceleration in volume in December, which is continued year-to-date with volume currently down mid-single digits. Speaking generally, trends are still tied to our exposure to away from home, coupled with a level of lockdown, but our business has become more durable compared to the spring of 2020, based on the learnings and actions we have taken. Our teams around the world have applied these learnings from the peak of the crisis to better navigate short term setbacks. Globally in the fourth quarter, progress remained mixed and even within regions, there was ongoing recovery as well as challenges. For example, in Asia-Pacific, countries are at different stages. In China, we are indeed emerging stronger, thanks to our strategic actions with Q4 share gains to complement our 2020 share gains in both on and off premise. Japan drove incremental transactions through their price pack decoupling, but soft traffic in vending continued pressure mix. In India, challenges remain, but at home trends was strong, and we saw signs of recovery in away from home channels through the holidays. EMEA showed resilience despite experiencing varying levels of lockdown through the quarter, driving a dispersion in results between developed and developing markets. Western Europe was the most affected by the resurgence, while West Africa and Turkey showed positive momentum. In North America, away from home volumes were impacted by multiple states restricting bars and banning indoor dining. Sparkling water trends remained robust with the expansion of AHA and Topo Chico mineral water, as well as simply and fairlife also performing well. In Latin America, trends were strong early in the quarter, but slowed in December due to restrictions and less stimulus support. Single-serve is recovering as a percentage of mix in our business, a multi-serve refillables grew at a double digit pace. Brazil's results remained strong, and Mexico improved sequentially. In global ventures, despite the headwind of renewed UK lockdowns impacting our Costa retail stores, express machines performed well. We continued expansion in China, Japan and further into Europe and our Testing Express and Proud to Serve platforms, along with the launch of costacoffee.com in the U.S. Our Bottling Investment Group further improved operating margin performance and made progress on cooler productivity, and SKU rationalization. Almost all markets gained or maintained share with Vietnam achieving its highest ever sparkling share. From a category perspective, we saw relative outperformance for sparkling in the fourth quarter. Trademark Coke delivered 1% volume growth, delivered by as zero sugar offerings which were up 3% for the quarter and 4% for the year. While our overall market share performance continued to be impacted by channel mix, as our highest share away from home business remains pressured. We did gain underlying value in both at home and away from home channels. We are poised to emerge stronger in both channels due to our actions to support customers and to ensure seamless execution from a supply chain perspective. Thinking about 2021, there is no doubt the near term trajectory of our recovery will still be impacted by the presence of the virus in most markets. It is still early days in the vaccination process, and we'd expect to see further improvements in our business as vaccinations become more widely available over the coming months. It's clear that the pace and availability of vaccines will look different around the world, and therefore we'll likely see some level of asynchronous recovery, depending both on vaccine distribution and other macroeconomic factors. Amidst this backdrop, we will ensure that the system remains flexible to adjust the near term uncertainties, while at the same time, continuing to push forward on initiatives we have championed to emerge stronger. So let me touch briefly on our progress against several initiatives today, and we'll provide further detail on these as well as other important business drivers at our Virtual Cagny presentation next week. Our networked organization is coming together and creating empowerment through clear decision rights and accountability. We have our overall operating unit and global category team structures, and are already changing the way we work. We've established a new platform services organization, 9 hubs are currently being stood up. Our ultimate goal is to scale our resources and capabilities to drive value and growth, including investing in new consumer analytics and digital tools. As we go through the transformation, we are ensuring that we have a diverse and equitable representation across our global workforce. Our long term profitable growth will be powered by our optimized brand portfolio. We've streamlined our portfolio from 400 to 200 master brands, allowing global category teams to identify the greatest opportunities and allocate investments accordingly. These targeted investments will leverage our leader brands more effectively, and convert Challenger and Explorer brands into leaders more quickly and consistently. Additionally, our portfolio streamlining allows us to focus attention on resources on what we do best, brand building and innovation. This will make room for more consumer centric products down the road. Great brand building begins with a deep understanding of our consumer that converts into superior quality products. To enhance our marketing effectiveness, we are building targeted experiential campaigns that are data driven and occasion-based and always on. We are eager to share upcoming work generated by this new marketing model including our first ever global Sprite Campaign, is called \"Let's be clear\", it invites drinkers to reset and refresh. And Fanta's new colorful initiative seeks to make snacking moments more playful around the world. At the same time, we are optimizing our marketing spend, focusing on our strongest brands and most compelling opportunities. We have a global creative and media agency review underway, which will improve processes, eliminate duplication, and drive efficiency to fuel reinvestment in our brands. Our innovation pipeline for 2021 has been shaped and coordinated for scale and impact, consists of global bevs like the new taste and design for Coke Zero Sugar, and regional bevs across categories like the expansion of our Authentic Tea House franchise across Asia. We're still pursuing intelligent local experimentation like adding functional benefits to some of our local hydration brands. And there's also innovation that leverages our strength in revenue growth management through packaging initiatives. This includes our first 100% recycled PET bottles in the U.S. for smart water understanding, along with a new 13.2 ounce 100% recycled PET bottle for trademark Coca Cola. We will also continue to expand Topo Chico Hard Seltze, which is already launched in several cities in Latin America and Europe. The global pandemic has undoubtedly expedited the shift to a digital world, and we're structuring the organization around this opportunity. We've been digitizing the enterprise for several years and have stepped up our evolution into an organization that can skillfully execute marketing, commercial, sales and distribution both offline and online. We're also leveraging existing pockets of excellence in e-commerce around the globe. The myCoke B2B platform continues to add outlets and is expanding to new markets. Our O2O partnerships with multiple food aggregators ensure beverage availability and visibility. Our multi-platform venture WABI, it connects our system and other consumer products companies to store owners and end consumers through an ecosystem of digital apps. Thanks to our network model, WABI is now available in 23 cities across five continents. The ecosystem is powerful and has already attracted bottler interest and collaboration in several regions. Bottler alignment also remains an imperative, seamless system connectivity helps us maintain local relevance, while benefiting from global scale. We continue to engage with our bottling partners holistically to fuel the network for long term growth. We're working to lift and shift capabilities. We can focus on being successful today, while also pursuing our ambitions for the future. And before I turn over to John, I want to express how proud I am of our support for communities and our sustainability achievements during the year that brought much disruption to the world. We remain grounded by our purpose and our ESG work is embedded in our business and the value we create. We contributed to COVID-19 relief around the world. We continue to focus on racial equity, including the introduction of our global social justice framework. We've made progress against priorities such as world without waste, which includes setting a new target to reduce the use of virgin PET in our packaging. We're also making progress against our 2030's science-based carbon target, which is a critical milestone to achieving our ambition to be net zero carbon by 2050. We accomplished our goal to empower 5 million women by 2020, creating shared value for these women, their families and communities, while growing our business through their involvement in both retail and distribution businesses. And we won't stop there. We'll have more updates in our business and sustainability report, and World Without Waste report in the coming months. To summarize, we are confident that we will successfully navigate through a dynamic market environment in 2021 to deliver against our objectives. We will emerge stronger with more consumers, higher share, stronger system economics and greater stakeholder impact. As vaccine distributions continue, we'll have more visibility into how the global recovery will take shape. And given our confidence in the levers we have to manage the business, we are providing an outlook for 2021. Importantly, we're staying true to our commitment to consumer centricity and our beverages for life strategy. We've made great progress in equipping the company to win for years to come, as we will fulfill our purpose to refresh the world and make a difference. Now John will provide more details on our results and our guidance.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will go over our fourth quarter performance and touch on the components of our outlook for 2021. First, let me start with a comment on the tax case that James referred to earlier in the call. As he mentioned, we disagree with the U.S. Tax Court opinion and will vigorously defend our position. In the Form 8-K filed this morning, we provide detail on the process we've undergone in arriving at our current position and determining next steps. Thorough analysis has led us to believe we will ultimately be successful, and while we have recorded a tax reserve of $438 million in consideration of the alternative transfer pricing methodologies that could be applied by the courts in resolving the litigated matters. We have not made any changes to our underlying effective tax rates going forward. That said, there is no assurance that the courts will ultimately rule in the company's favor. It is possible that all or some portion of the adjustment proposed by the IRS and affirmed by the Tax Court could be upheld. To this end we have estimated approximately $12 billion for the aggregate incremental tax liability for years up to and including 2020, including interest accrued through December 31, 2020. This amount assumes the IRS prevails and applies their methodology and considers any adjustments from previously accrued transition tax payable under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We have also indicated that applying their methodology would increase our underlying effective tax rates by approximately 3.5%. There are many puts and takes that inform the range of incremental liability and potential change in tax rate. I encourage you to refer to the disclosure in the Form 8-K for more in-depth detail. While there is uncertainty associated with the timing and ultimate resolution, we will continue to prioritize investing in the business to drive long term growth, as well as supporting dividend growth for our shareowners. What we strongly believe we will prevail, we are confident we have ample flexibility between our cash generation and balance sheet, to manage the range of outcomes, outlined in this morning's disclosure. We will be as transparent as possible throughout this process. Turning to our performance in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020. Our Q4 organic revenue decline of 3% showed sequential improvement from the 6% decline in the third quarter, and 9% decline for the full year. October and November volumes were down low single digits and approaching flat year-over-year trends. But as James mentioned, we saw a slowdown in December due to a resurgence in the virus and increased lockdown restrictions in many markets. The contraction in the comparable gross margin was primarily driven by continued pressure on our channel and package mix between away from home and at home, as well as currency headwinds. Additionally, segment mix swung to a headwind in the quarter due to outperformance of our bottling investments group. Comparable operating margin expanded through ongoing disciplined cost management, more than offsetting pressure from the top line. It's worth noting the decline in SG&A spend this quarter was impacted by timing due to the phasing effect of marketing reduction over the year. As we've previously stated, we have been reintroducing marketing spend in a targeted way, identifying compelling opportunities to invest across countries, categories and brands. Fourth quarter comparable EPS of $0.47 represents an increase of 6% and full year comparable earnings of $1.95, reflects an 8% decline relative to our 2019 results. On a comparable currency neutral basis, earnings were up 14% for the quarter and down 2% for the year. Throughout the crisis, we have remained intensely focused on our cash flow goals. While our cash from operations was down 6% for the year, we have continued to make good progress on our working capital, and have exercised tight management of our capital spend. This is exemplified by our 2020 free cash flow performance coming off strong momentum in 2019. We finished up 3% for the year and reached free cash flow conversion of over a 100%, despite the headwinds our business faced. As we begin to see prospects for a recovery later in 2021, driven by vaccination and consumers returning to many of their previous routines, socializing, work and travel, our focus would be on converting top line growth to maximize returns. Our improving level of visibility into a recovery as the year goes on, as well as the many lessons we\u2019ve learned in the last year, have enabled us to provide an outlook for 2021. We currently expect organic revenue percentage growth of high single digits, and comparable earnings per share percentage growth of high single to low double digits versus 2020. While we're confident we will see recovery this year and expect to deliver 2021 earnings that are at or above 2019 levels, we've provided a wider range than usual to account for lingering uncertainty in the near term, as well as the potential for the acceleration to be a synchronous in nature. There are many considerations as you think about the drivers of our guidance. A calendar shift will impact the quarterly cadence, as we have five additional days in the first quarter and six fewer days in the fourth quarter this year. The trajectory of the recovery will be a significant factor. And we expect to be dealing with COVID-19 for the better part of the year, with the first half likely to be more challenging than the second half. Currently year-to-date volume is down mid-single digits, as we left the toughest quarterly comparison of 2020, before the pandemic hit much of the world. To the degree that the top line is driven by away from home recovery, we would expect to channel and package pressures experienced last year to a base, which would drive price mix improvement and gross margin expansion. From a cost perspective, we see several factors at play. In 2020, there were many operating expenses that were significantly reduced or eliminated that are likely to come back this year. We will continue to step up levels of investment behind our brands to drive the top line. We expect the return on that spend to become more favorable as mobility stabilizes and away from home channels regain momentum. The changes we are driving with our strategic transformation will lead to more efficient and productive spending over time. These changes include our organizational restructuring, streamlined portfolio, disciplined innovation and optimized marketing approach. We will continue to flex our spend relative to what is dictated by the market conditions around us. While we are seeing commodity prices begin to rise, given our hedge positions, we currently expect the impact to cost of goods sold to be benign. As we noted in our release, based on current spot rates and our hedge positions, we expect currency to be a tailwind of approximately 2% to 3% to the top line, and approximately 3% to 4% to comparable EPS in 2021. We will continue to focus on free cash flow and expect to deliver at least $10 billion in cash for operations, while we expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion. This does not contemplate any payment relating to the tax case. We look forward to providing more insight into the drivers our outlook, General Virtual Cagny Presentation next week. In the face of this global pandemic, I am extremely grateful for our team around the world and the way they were able to pivot and execute through such a challenging environment. I'm also excited about the work we've undertaken to set us up for a very promising future. I am confident that our overall strategic direction will enable us to deliver 2021 earnings that are at or above 2019 levels, as we emerge stronger. With that operator, we are ready to take Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nSteve Powers: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks. So the profit and the free cash flow, flow through that you've delivered in 2020 and guided to in the year to come is impressive, given the top line headwind and the complexities you're facing. I know a lot of that is driven by underlying productivity that's set to continue. But I'd also assume it's been aided by some level of diminished level of strategic investment marketing capabilities, that kind of thing. That is probably set to continue for a good part of '21 before demand is more clearly on an upswing. So, I guess the question is, is there a way to frame how much strategic investment is embedded in the '21 outlook, perhaps relative to 2019 or some other benchmark? And where do you think the right level of investment will be post-pandemic on a run rate basis to make sure you're positioned to hit the high-end of the long term algorithm that you've been targeting? And if there's a way to talk a little bit about the phasing. Does that investment come in coincident with recovery? Should we expect it to be ahead of recovery, just how you're thinking about those dynamics would be great? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Powers: Good morning.\nJames Quincey: Let me start with the future and work backwards. When things have become new normal post-pandemic, the world is fully open. And clearly we'll be back, investing at the sort of pressure levels of marketing and all the other components of the business that we believe is necessary to drive the top line in a margin accretive fashion that is consistent with the long term growth models. And as you think about comparing that to 2019, clearly, we will have baked into that the benefits of not just the new organization, but the fundamental rework of the marketing. Some of it is a reprogramming or where the marketing goes and that's most obviously reflected in the advertising number that we show in our disclosures. But there are other marketing spend, which typically gets called enabling, where we have a major program to really look at how we can make that much more efficient, right across the board of all the things we do from relooking at the agencies, relooking at the way we do research, the digitization and many things. So the will when comparing the new normal at 2019 be an embedded degree of efficiency across the board. But in the end, we are the view that the marketing pressure will need to be similar to the sorts of pressure levels that it was in '18 and '19, when we were achieving the sorts of revenue growth rates and starting to see the flow through into profits that we were looking for. In the run up from now to that future, we have of course taken a measured and balanced view of what we think 2021 will look like. And our guidance ultimately, is a corridor where we believe we can manage whether things get better, in line with our view or quicker than our view, we will be in the corridor and we will start reapplying the pressure of the marketing and the innovation that we believe will drive the revenue growth. Or if things are a little slower on the opening, we'll pull the levers and be more cautious about the rate at which we reapply the marketing pressures, or as you mentioned free cash flow obviously one of the levers to sustaining or in fact growing free cash flow last year was to back off on some of the CapEx. Simply understood, some of our CapEx is in new found in equipment or new vending equipment. And if those channels are not open, there's no point in putting new equipment in there until they're on the verge of being open. So there's a self-regulation between the marketing and some of the CapEx on. If the lockdown is greater, we will logically back off and then as the lockdown reduces and the market is more open, those things will come back on. And so, we'd spend more marketing more CapEx but have more revenue. And that's why we believe we can operate within the corridor of the guidance we've provided and emerge stronger than this and really drive growth into the future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. I want to talk a little bit about North America profitability over the longer term. I mean, obviously this year, there was a nice step up, but tough to look at 2020 as I guess, change in isolation. But I was struck by the news and you mentioned it today, the 13-ounce bottle. So I was just curious about efforts to get broader and more aggressive on price tag management, revenue growth management in the U.S. Talked about what that could mean for longer term profitability in North America, even without addressing the nature of your supply chain here. And by the way, if there's anything you are starting to explore in terms of supply chain structure in the U.S. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. The revenue growth management journey has been a multiyear journey globally, and indeed, more recently reviewed [ph] in North America. We've started to see some good benefits come through from that. Just over 13-ounce bottle is obviously good from a revenue growth point of view. It is also worth mentioning that 100% recycled PET bottle on Coke, which is the first one in the U.S., that's very linked to our World Without Waste strategy. So clearly, we are going to continue to explore and drive particularly some of the smaller packages, whether it's this smaller bottle or some of the sleeker cans as part of providing the sizes that consumers are interested in. This also connects with our revenue growth management story. And as I said on previous calls, I believe that is a multiyear runway for our efforts on RGM in North America that are starting to pay dividends over time, that is not just helping on the margin front, but frankly, is helping on the revenue front. So, I think there's a lot more that can be done to drive that in North America. And that's kind of in the underlying category of margin. Of course, there are structural changes to the margin on whether we have re-franchised or not to the bottlers or whether we continue or what our exact role is in kind of the system's internal supply chain. And therefore, if we do finish products, or we get -- the bottlers manufacture those products. Of course, what we will do overtime is look to do the most efficient and effective ecosystem of supply options for ourselves and our bottling partners. We have recently moved some lines to third-party co-packing of water. And as and when other opportunities are there, we'll consider them. But ultimately, we have to have the most efficient and effective supply chain between ourselves and the bottlers to satisfy the consumers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hi, good morning. So, John, I just wanted to follow up on the comments around ample flexibility to handle the tax judgment. And I was just looking for a bit more detail on two separate scenarios. One, just more short term versus the unfavorable $3 billion opinion potentially in order to appeal that, might you have to post cash that could impact your dividend plans. How do you think about that as well as capital allocation? And then second, if we think about the subsequent decade, if there were to be an unfavorable outcome, I understand that's not what you believe, but what if type of scenario. Are the cash outflows far enough out that it doesn't have a significant impact in terms of the way you think about the dividend and sustainability? Or do you have to sort of adjust plans ahead of time in case and how do you think through that conceptually?\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Dara. As I mentioned, in the script, I think we've got ample flexibility through both the way in which we've been managing the balance sheet. And when we think about the cash generation prospects for the next few years to manage any scenario, we continue to believe that we have a very strong case and unlikely to have to consider that worst case scenario. But the work we've done, really beginning last year to organize our debt portfolio in a way that gives us more flexibility. And when we take that into consideration, along with the cash will generate in the next two to three years, I think we feel pretty confident we can take care of just about any scenario.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Thank you. I'd like to ask for a few more details on advertising spend. I think John, you mentioned a few phrases Creative Media review, marketing efficiency and such. Then also, I think you mentioned marketing pressure being similar to kind of '18, '19 levels. So, if we look at '19, the ad spend was roughly around $4.3 billion, obviously is much lower than that for 2020. Should we expect that figure to get back to where it was this year? Or is it a sort of thing that you've just become more efficient? And perhaps it's a figure that's 5% lower or 10% lower than what was running out before?\nJohn Murphy: Yes, thanks. So, I don't think we're fixed on a number that's necessarily linked to 2019. Given a couple of factors, number one, the work that we have highlighted, we are doing around efficiency. We believe that there's a tremendous opportunity for us to drive greater efficiency across the marketing spend portfolio, and particularly in the enabling area. Secondly, we've also become I think, a lot more flexible. We've learned a lot in the last year that allows us to, so to speak, turn the tap on and off with much greater fluency than perhaps we've done in the past. And then thirdly, as you look at the marketing landscape, the mix of spending that will be required market-to-market is going to evolve. And we need to be flexible in order to handle that. So net-net is we will continue to focus on what our markets need, both in total investment terms, as well as in the mix of spend that's appropriate for each of these markets. We will continue to drive the kind of efficiency that we now know is available to us. And I think we land in whatever landing spot that means in terms of total dollars, but I think we've got a good handle on both being efficient, being effective and investing appropriately as markets recover across the world.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to touch on innovation. Obviously, it sounds like you're making a lot of progress on your portfolio streamlining initiatives. And you've been doing, I think a good job at managing all of this. But I guess I'm trying to understand how you're balancing this innovation and messaging your new, more streamlined portfolio strategy within your organization? And then, are you at all concerned that this increases some risk of stifling innovation and possibly discouraging risk taking over the long term?\nJames Quincey: I guess the headline answer is, no, we don't think we're going to stifle innovation, quite the opposite, we're looking actually for innovation to continue, where it was in '18 and '19 in terms of playing an important role in driving consumer engagement, interest of customers, and therefore revenue growth and on to profitability. And so this is very much about finding a way to be able to identify the biggest best within the innovation pipeline, understanding that there's still going to be an very important role for experimentation. There's just no way of knowing from the outset, no matter what one might think from a personal point of view as to which ones are going to be the absolute best going forward. So we're back to innovation. Clearly, we did less in 2020. We will be increasing meaningfully the degree of innovation in 2021. Very focused on are these attracting more consumers to our portfolios, is it allowing them to enjoy our beverages perhaps more frequently or greater financial at greater prices. Ultimately, we're looking for more impact. We had looked at our innovation pipeline, and while we had done a lot, we had some inefficiency in it. So we're driving for greater impact, which we were able to achieve in 2020, and that we will get again in 2021. So I think there's absolutely the right level of focus on innovation. We'll continue to learn more as we go through 2021. But none of this rationalization portfolio is about stifling, quite the contrary. It's about if you like, clearing away the least successful so there's more room for the most successful and for the next generation of innovation.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sean King with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nSean King: Hi, good morning. With respect to your restructuring and streamlining plans announced last or mid-last year, are you seeing any areas for greater opportunity for savings across your organization? I guess just given that the disruption has dragged on longer than most throughout the time.\nJames Quincey: I think what we have at the moment is a very clear plan that we have been implementing on resetting the organization, Let's go Forward. Again, the need and the objectives of the organizational change we made were pre-existing, as COVID we knew we needed to find a way to make the organization more agile, more focused and to scale up some of the activities to a more platform level, especially given the ever increasing importance of data and the logic that that can't be done lots of different ways everywhere. So, it was a preexisting idea that we took the necessity, if we like, or the opportunity in the course of 2020, to accelerate its implementation. Of course, there'll be ongoing opportunities, and we'll learn with the world will evolve, we will evolve and change will happen into the future. But I would not start the planning that this is recurring levels of productivity at these sorts of levels, much beyond the couple of current years, it will impact at the moment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning. Just a question on the comments of a balanced outlook for 2021. I mean, I fully appreciate that you're giving guidance, and it's a wider range and there's a lot of uncertainty. But I mean, how do you figure out what sales do look like in the third, fourth quarter this year? I mean, are you going off of vaccination rates by country and then assuming things open up 30 days later? I appreciate any effort. But I just don't -- I'm interested to how you do kind of a bottoms up approach to looking at country by country around the world to come up with kind of even a rough ballpark?\nJames Quincey: Great question, Bill. Look, we relatively early on in the crisis, actually going back to the second quarter of last year, there was a team that did a lot of very intense and interesting work on looking at prior crises, whether military, economic or pandemic, going all the way back to our history, rounded years, and looking at what happened on the curves. And we came up with a set of assumptions and a set of analyses that then shaped our view as to what the disparate scenarios we faced were. And in simple terms, the biggest indicator or driver was a view on how long the pandemic would last and therefore, how long each country would take to get back to its 2019 levels of GDP. So, you can take all the countries in the world and you can segment them into, it'll take them one year, it'll take them two years, it'll take them three years, and there are countries that will take four years to get back there. And that is what we've done. And we were able to see, obviously, by the end of 2020, that the progress of the world and the progress of countries quite closely followed the scenarios in our model, and in the overall macro idea. So, it has given us some sense as we continue into year two of those projections, as to what sort of corridor we'll be looking at going forward through '21 and into '22 is likely to look like by country or by region.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet from Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nLaurent Grandet: Hey, good morning, James and John. I'd like to focus this morning on the '21 guidance. It seems soft in terms of EPS growth especially in the year where you expect them in the high single digit organic top line growth, and 3% to 4% ForEx tailwind on top of it. So it probably doesn't embed fast recovery of the on-premise channel that is more profitable. But could you help reconcile or should we think it's a conservative EPS guide?\nJames Quincey: I think the simple starting point to reconcile this is a few points, Laurent. One, that the impact in 2020 a lot of it came on some of our finished goods businesses that do not have the same margin levels as the concentrate business. So, for a simple example, the closure of a Costco store has a disproportionate impact on revenue versus profits versus not selling some coke products through the concentrate business. So, what we expect in 2021 is a greater recovery in some of these away from home, particularly our finished product businesses, whether it be some of the Costa businesses or the BIG bottlers, and those are mechanically headwinds in terms of margins. The second very important effect in 2021 is, of course, the reversal of our stewarding of resources in 2020. We clearly took the decision that if there was not good reasons to invest in marketing or in market facing CapEx or market facing operating expenses, then we would not do so. And the more the recovery occurs in 2021, the more we are going to reinstate those expenses, as well as, of course, a number of elements of the incentive schemes which will be budgeted for at 100% in 2021. So that's why we have not gone for line-by-line guidance within 2021. There's so many moving pieces that are not your typical year of moving from a normal year and comparing it to another normal year. You've got these weird effects of what's actually in 2020 and the way we stewarded the resources and we're still able to drive free cash flow. That's why we've given some wider corridors and have given the top and the bottom line, which we think are the most measured and balanced approach that we can give today.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nKevin Grundy: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. James, I wanted to spend a little bit of time on the Topo Chico Hard Seltzer launch in the U.S., but sort of within the context of learnings from the launch of the product in Latin America and Europe, you spent a little bit of time earlier in the call. As I recall, the company made some tweaks to Coke Energy on the formulation with some learnings in Europe. So a handful of questions. How is the product delivering against market share objectives so far in those regions? Where is it sourcing occasions? Has that been in line with the expectations? And then maybe we spent some time on investment. Where does the Topo Chico Hard Seltzer launched in the U.S. sort of rank in terms of the other priorities? You mentioned, a global campaign around Sprite, the importance of Tea in Asia. Maybe you can just sort of characterize for us, even a high level, how big of a priority the product success is this year in the U.S.? So thanks for all that.\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. So we've launched Topo Chico Hard Seltzer in a number of Latin America markets, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Peru, Chile, Brazil. Strong initial feedback from consumers and customers, still very early to even have market share rates. But the rate of sale and the repeats look very good, but obviously still too early really to tell. Also, we've launched in a few markets in Europe, again, still very early to tell, but repeat rates and a rate of sale look encouraging. And so in the coming quarters, we'll be happy to share some of those learnings. I'm sure there'll be learnings and we'll tweak things as we go forward. Now, as it relates to your question about the U.S., it's important here to remember how different the U.S. is versus the rest of the international market, because of U.S. alcohol market regulations. The Topo Chico Hard Seltzer will not be going through the company stroke the bottling system in the U.S. It will be handled all by a collaboration with the Molson Coors team. So it is not competing in any way, shape or form as a priority with all the other things that are going on that are all obviously being done by ourselves and the bottlers in the U.S. And I think Molson Coors are very excited about the opportunity in the U.S., it\u2019s certainly been good initial reception from distributors in that marketplace. More to come in future quarters.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. You referred in the earnings call press release that Q4 had better market share trends, roughly even as opposed to down a little bit for the full year. How much of that was due to at least the initial reopening of on-premise and so a channel mix effect? And how much of that was due to commercial momentum, either in particular countries or particular brands that you would expect to carry on into 2021? And then, just as a follow-up on a prior question, can you just give us an update on Coca-Cola Energy? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: So, fourth quarter market share trend were definitely better than they had been in the previous two quarters. And whilst yes, we did benefit from the reopening, remembering that we have generally speaking, materially higher share in the away from home than the at-home then obviously, the reopening tends to improve the overall share trend. But we will also gaining share in Q4 versus Q3 or Q2 in both at-home and away from home. So that is, in the end commercial momentum built into what was going on in those channels. And we would certainly expect to gain share away and at-home in 2021 and therefore gain share overall, particularly as the reopenings happen. And then Coke Energy, we will be obviously, particularly in the U.S. that was trying to launch that coming into the beginning of 2020 was particularly difficult, given the immediate lockdowns. And so we're going to come back on Coke Energy in 2021. Despite the challenges, we've had interesting repeat rates, we've recruited new users to the category at rates that are very interesting versus other recent launches in the category, by bringing new drinkers into energy and had interesting levels of dollar retail sales in year one compared to other innovations. So we think there's something working there back to the original hypothesis that there was space in the energy category to come in with a proposition that would attract new drinkers to the category. So we've got reasons to think that we should double down again in 2021.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you, and good morning. So my question is a follow-up on the expense savings from the reorganization and also have a follow-up on RGM. So how much are you embedding in savings from the reorg into EPS guidance for the year? And on the clarification, James, on the comments on RGM and the relationship with the bottlers. Are you embedding higher suggest switch pricing to be executed by the bottlers or into this cost on top of the lower straight spent, perhaps partially offset the mix impact that you had in 2020, and as the pandemic lingers?\nJohn Murphy: Andrea, let me take that. One on the expense savings, we had highlighted in our release last year, an expected benefit of between $350 million and $550 million. And we're on track to deliver that. Some of it falls into this year, some of it will fall into the first part of next year, kind of aligned to the progress that we make on the implementation of the new model. So that's on the expenses. And on the whole topic of RGM, the past year has actually I think, highlighted even more than ever the importance of having this as a key part of our top line algorithm. I don't expect us to have material changes in how we go about it. We're very clear on the drivers at the local market level, when it comes to both pricing and its relationship with inflation, and having the right packaging architecture to enable us to manage as in an optimal way, the conditions of any given market. And if anything, I think our teams around the world are even more focused on that area, as a way to navigate a path forward that allows us to deliver on the revenue objectives that we've outlined.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning. Just a higher level or longer term question. So in the past, the company has had longer term goals for operating margins, clearly some M&A and tax accounting changes made those margins less relevant. But given as an even greater focus on efficiency and the recent margin flow through, and probably that gives you some increased confidence around your ability to lean on margins in case of uncertain outcomes, just judging by your outlook for 2021. And I guess appreciating your response to prior questions around mix and spending levels that could potentially return. But I wonder if you have any, just high level thoughts, from the learnings that you had this year about your ability to drive margins on where you think the company's margin structure might be able to go over the longer term? And maybe specifically, how North America factors into that outlook? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Chris. I think the answer really is rooted in our belief in the sustainability of our long term growth algorithm. And as you know, embedded into that algorithm is an assumption that over time we can and we will continue to expand margins. I think any given year needs to be taken in the context of that longer term perspective. 2020, as you say, it was a particularly unusual year, and it afforded us the opportunity to under the umbrella of never waste a crisis to drive greater efficiency and to have a bump in our operating margin performance for 2020. But I would think of the longer term in the context of the long term growth model. And we manage a portfolio of very distinctive markets around the world, and they contribute at different times along that journey and North America is no different. We see plenty of opportunity, as James highlighted earlier in the North American business to improve profitability levels over time. And that will, I think, be a key factor in our belief that the long term growth model, as it currently is expressed is doable and unsustainable. And so I'd like a sort of couch to the whole margin topic in that frame.\nJames Quincey: Thanks so very much, everyone. Just a few closing thoughts. The objectives and the priorities we set for ourselves at the peak of the crisis have really galvanized the company, and are driving our ability to continue to execute through the volatile near term dynamics. While the virus is still a factor in the near term, we're well on our way to emerging stronger and to returning to the path of delivering at the high end of our long-term growth model. Focus and the flexibility of the network model will drive the entire Coke system for years to come. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company, and for joining us today. Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

While our business continued to be affected by lockdowns in some markets, especially in places with strong exposure to the away-from-home channels we are encouraged by the response and execution of our system. Together with our bottlers, we continue to focus on winning as the world reopens. We've moved quickly to address the near-term realities and we are working to deliver on the priorities we outlined in our second quarter call. I'm also inspired each and every day by what I see from our associates their resilience, their drive, and their pride in this great system. They're working purposefully to serve our consumers and customers and to do it safely. They are making a difference in the communities around the world, and for this and much more, I offer my sincerest thanks and appreciation. Today, I'll provide an update on the quarter including where we're seeing the most improvements in our business and where recovery is moving at slow pace. Also I'll share some thoughts on the remainder of the year and as we look forward to 2021. Then I'll share progress we're already making to emerge stronger. And finally, I'll hand over to John to discuss the quarter in more detail including how we continue to execute in this challenging environment. In the third quarter, we continued to rebound from the pressures we experienced at the peak of the lockdown as the world generally moves into the recovery phase. That said, the trajectory of our business trends continue to be closely linked to the size of our away-from-home business in any given country and the level of the lockdowns in the market. From the 25% volume decline that we saw in April, the mid-single-digit declines through the summer, and the low single-digit decline since September, our volume trends have continued to improve. Much of the sequential improvement has been driven by the away-from-home channels, which represent roughly half of our business globally. Our away-from-home volume was down in the mid-teens in the quarter, a significant improvement from the April lows which approached 50% declines. This was driven by the agility of our sales teams throughout the system and the efforts to create value for our customers during the gradual reopening phase. We are seeing the away-from-home recovery starting to stabilize given the ongoing restrictions in many regions. Our at-home channels also saw an acceleration throughout the quarter. Specifically, grocery and e-commerce channels continue to experience solid demand benefiting both from shifts in consumer behavior and our system's actions to capture those opportunities. The system is working jointly to manage the supply and distribution shifts make key decisions around portfolio priorities and leverage digital data to identify new outlets to further growth. We continue to see progress, but the environment remains dynamic and it is not a straight-line recovery around the world different markets are seeing varying degrees of impact. In EMEA, at-home channels continued to perform well and sparkling soft drinks and juices remained resilient. Volume improved in away-from-home channels throughout the quarter as activities resumed with limitations. In Latin America, volume improved as government restrictions eased. Specifically, Brazil continues to be an outperformer. But economic pressures remain and our recovery in Mexico has been slower than expected. Moving to North America, strong performance in at-home channels was offset by continued softness in our foodservice business. While some away-from-home channels have been slower to recover, we benefited from traffic improvements in channels like convenience retail and quick service restaurants. Importantly, digital partnerships with restaurants and aggregators to optimize menus have resulted in a four-point increase in attachment rates and digital commerce retail sales have more than doubled year-to-date outpacing the category. In Asia-Pacific, China is well on its way to emerge stronger driven by solid performance in sparkling's soft drinks. Recovery efforts in India and Japan continue and we have seen meaningful improvement in the face of ongoing restrictions. Global Ventures remains pressured, but has seen a significant improvement from Q2 with organic revenues improving by over 30 points. Our Costa retail stores, one of the most affected parts of our company at the peak of the global lockdowns, are now almost entirely open. While traffic is unlikely to fully recover in the near-term, our First One on Us campaign has shown promising signs driving over one million new consumers to the Costa app. We continue our journey to be a global multi-platform coffee company under the Costa brand. Across our channels and regions, our brand portfolio is working hard to return to pre-COVID levels of growth and we have made progress in the quarter. For example trademark Coke delivered volume growth in Q3. We also saw growth in local champions like Simply and fairlife in the U.S. and Thums Up in India. With the NARTD category continuing to be affected by a shift to at-home channels, our underlying strength in value share this quarter was more than offset by the negative mix in away-from-home where we tend to have stronger share positions. Clicking down, we are seeing positive share momentum in EMEA and Latin America including gains in sparkling soft drinks. In fact, trademark Coca-Cola saw share gains in 80% of our top markets globally this quarter. Share gains are a key metric of our determination to emerge stronger, and we are intent on recapturing lost ground and more through the recovery phase. In summary, we are encouraged by the improvement in our business. However, it's important to remember the world is in a fragile state. We've seen reopening trends begin to moderate, and the away-from-home recovery showed signs of stalling in September with the increase of restrictions in several markets. There is potential for increased regional lockdowns as we enter colder seasons in the Northern Hemisphere. We don't expect to return to the peak levels of global lockdown, but we are prepared for setbacks due to the local spikes in cases and targeted restrictions and closures. The pandemic has been a catalyst for change for our company, but the initial work behind our strategic transformation was in motion for some time before the crisis hit. We've been challenging legacy ways of doing business and the pandemic helped us realize we could be bolder in our efforts. Last quarter, we highlighted five priorities to accelerate our transformation. We set out to optimize our portfolio and instill more discipline in our innovation approach, coupled with more effective marketing, stepped-up revenue growth management and execution, and enhanced system collaboration. We also said we'll evolve our organization and invest in capabilities to ensure we can bring the strategy to life. We're moving swiftly to deliver against those priorities with our goal to reach pre-COVID growth levels ahead of the economic recovery. Firstly, we set out to position our portfolio for success, focusing on scaled growth through targeted resource allocation and optimization. Over the past few months, a cross-functional team has worked to identify the right brands for a growth portfolio that will drive quality leadership and help us achieve our Beverages for Life ambitions. We have finalized the master brands in this growth portfolio, which consists of about 200 global regional and local brands that will allow us to remain truly consumer-centric, focusing on those brands that can be scaled to drive profits for the long-term. For the brands who are not selected, we have begun the work with our bottlers to quickly sunset or thoughtfully transition them to one of the growth brands over the next year. Secondly, our marketing transformation is also underway. We have undertaken a global initiative to improve marketing efficiency and effectiveness, jointly led by our marketing, procurement and finance teams. This is a top priority and the initial work to date has validated the opportunity to sustainably reduce our spend via proven procurement methodologies and other efficiency levers, while maintaining and improving marketing effectiveness. Importantly, this is not a top-down-driven exercise to reduce expenses. There is no savings target. Rather by improving our processes, eliminating duplication and optimizing spend on things like third-party agencies, we will increase our effectiveness and be able to fuel reinvestment in our brands. When it comes to innovation, we're focusing on bigger, more scalable bets. And to be clear, this strategy does not mean less innovation overall. Already this mindset is showing results. Year-to-date, revenue contribution from innovation is higher than last year and the amount of revenue per innovation has doubled. Innovation will come in different forms. We can leverage a trademark to expand the category like we're doing with Coke Energy. We can also create a brand like AHA to participate in a growing category or subcategory. And we can also expand our addressable market by entering a new category like we've done so with Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, which debuted last month in select cities across Latin America with more markets coming soon including the U.S. Ultimately, we're combining discipline with agility to win drinkers share and profits. We continue to experiment on a local level and our new approach allows us to move faster to find and scale our best initiatives. We have a robust pipeline in the works for next year and expect innovation to continue to contribute meaningfully to our growth going forward. And as we adapt our organization, we continue to apply our enhanced revenue growth management capabilities, provide beverage options at the right price and for the occasion consumers are looking for and to bring new drinkers to our brands. We are also strengthening our bottling partnerships across the system to enhance execution across channels. In order to ensure the structure of our company facilitates the success of our accelerated strategy, we're becoming a more networked organization that will combine the power of scale with deep knowledge to win locally. We expect this new networked model to be established and functioning at the beginning of the next year and Platform Services will be fully integrated, standardized and scaled over the course of next year. We're streamlining from 17 business units to nine operating units, which will accelerate decision-making while maintaining local market execution. We've announced five global category leads to steer the new marketing model and ensure relentless consumer focus on brands that can be scaled to even stronger positions. We're also creating a new Platform Services organization, which will be a critical enabler in supporting a networked web-working. It will be a collection of 10 areas of expertise, known as hubs that will partner with the operating units, categories and the center to develop capabilities and services needed to support their strategies as well as enable collaboration and execution. Our people are confident and engaged in this transformation and an enterprise mindset is taking hold. Our new leadership teams have been formed, and there are clear job descriptions to ensure accountability across functions. The changes to our structure will result in reallocation and a reduction in the number of associates. This is underway through a combination of voluntary separation programs as well as some level of involuntary reductions. Although these changes are never easy, I am certain they will allow us to emerge stronger. In addition, to executing on the five priorities, environmental, social and governance initiatives, always remain at the forefront of our minds and actions. Our ESG goals are embedded in how we operate as a business and we will continue to make progress across our key sustainability initiatives including our World Without Waste goals. For example, across markets representing 30% of our global volume we now have introduced 100% recycled plastic packaging options in at least one brand and this has grown even during the pandemic. And last month, The Netherlands and Norway became the second and third markets after Sweden to announce they will manufacture the entire local portfolio in 100% recycled PET. In the U.S., we continue to join other stakeholders in supporting policies to drive improved packaging collection and demand for recycled material such as California's new mandatory recycled-content legislation. In recognition of the importance of this topic to our company, and I know to many of you as well, I hope you will join us for our virtual ESG Investor Day on November 13th. To sum up, we are continuing to navigate through the uncertainties of the global pandemic. We are heading to a phase where the world is adapting to a new way of living with COVID. The progress we've made on accelerating our strategic transformation will give us the focus and flexibility to manage our business and execute with excellence today and to set ourselves up for better results in the long run. With that, I'll pass it over to you John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to comment on our third quarter performance and give perspective on the financial implications of our structural changes and new operating model. I'll also provide some additional context on our outlook. In the third quarter, I am pleased to report that our focus and flexibility enabled us to drive sequential improvement from the second quarter. Our organic revenue performance was down 6% driven by price/mix down 3% and concentrate sales down 4%. This quarter's performance compares to a 26% organic revenue decline in the second quarter. While most of that improvement came in the form of better volume trends, we also saw improved price/mix particularly when you look at this on a two-year average. Comparable gross margin contracted by about 140 basis points. This was primarily driven by continued albeit less pressure from our channel mix between away-from-home and at-home in addition to currency headwinds. Comparable operating margin expanded by approximately 230 basis points due to ongoing cost management offsetting the pressure from the top line. While our marketing spend remained below last year's levels, we did increase it sequentially and in a targeted way as we saw recovery in the business. We continue to monitor the effectiveness of spend with the goal of investing ahead of recovery. Below operating income we saw a strong sequential improvement in many of our equity stakes as our bottlers have quickly moved to adapt to the changes. Therefore, third quarter comparable EPS of $0.55 declined 2% year-over-year. This was better than our internal expectations, given stronger-than-anticipated volume trends in September and the improved equity income. While the pandemic has weighed on our cash from operations year-to-date, we saw significant sequential improvement in the third quarter and remain intensely focused on the free cash flow opportunities ahead. These include further progress in our working capital initiatives and being better stewards of our capital spend. While much has changed this year with the onset of the pandemic, our focus on converting top line growth to maximize returns has not. The changes we are making will lead us to more efficient and productive spending. These include our organizational restructuring, streamlined portfolio, disciplined innovation and optimized marketing approach. As James mentioned we're streamlining our master brands by approximately 50%, which significantly reduces complexity with an impact of less than 1% to top line and profits. We expect this impact to be more than offset over time by the benefits of greater focus on our growth brands. The combination of voluntary separation programs and involuntary reductions are estimated to result in expenses ranging from approximately $350 million to $550 million. While we are not defining a targeted level of cost savings historically in these scenarios we have seen a similar level of savings as compared to the cost of the programs. These actions will help us achieve a structure that is designed for growth, which in turn will fuel reinvestment to drive top line and margins for the long-term. Said another way the strategic priorities we've accelerated are designed to drive results that get us back to our long-term growth algorithm as fast as possible. In our last call, we talked about adapting to the various phases of the pandemic focusing on what we can manage and control and not getting ahead of ourselves with regard to when things might return to normal. We see no reason to change this approach for the remainder of the year. Different countries around the world are going through different phases. Some still dealing with the first wave, others dealing with or expecting a second wave and their respective governments taking a variety of approach. All of which means continued uncertainty regarding the pandemic and the macroeconomic picture. So within this context we will continue to hold off on providing more detailed guidance today. Having said that there are important factors to consider for the fourth quarter. We will be benefiting from two extra days in the quarter. To the degree that away-from-home channels are impacted by targeted restrictions, we would expect price/mix pressure to continue due to channel and package mix. This mix shift in our business will also continue to have implications for gross margins. We will continue to be prudent in our marketing expenditures, but stepping up investment in a targeted way ahead of recovery with a more efficient and effective approach. As we noted in our release, we expect a currency headwind of approximately 3% to the top line and approximately 9% to comparable operating income in the fourth quarter based on current spot rates and our hedge positions. Looking at today's rates and hedge positions at this stage the currency impact would be minimal as we head into next year. Coming out of an unusual year like 2020 will surely have implications for 2021. It is fair to assume that 2021 will have several considerations including the cycling of 2020 impacts, the step-up in discretionary spending as well as the strategic acceleration initiatives we've outlined. While it's too early to provide specific commentary, our actions give us increased confidence to recover faster than the broader economic recovery. We will provide more insight as part of our fourth quarter call. As we think about the long-term, we will continue our journey to improve cash flow where we had made much progress last year, as well as focus on asset optimization with a goal to becoming asset-right over time. Our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to have confidence in the health of our system as we emerge from the peak of lockdowns across the globe. System health is crucial to our success. We also remain committed to our dividend policy and balance sheet goals. We recognize the dividend is important to our investor base and continue to believe our long-term model can deliver the cash necessary to reinvest to grow the business while also supporting the dividend. We will continue to work to return to a dividend payout ratio as a percentage of free cash flow that approaches 75% over time. The acceleration of our strategy and the progress James outlined today will help drive long-term top and bottom line growth, not only for us but for the entire Coke system. The challenges that we faced during this pandemic are by no means, in the rearview mirror. Nevertheless, we are seeing promising signs, that the actions we're taking have put us on track to equip the organization and the data system to win. We are confident that we will return to the high-end of our long-term growth model. And do so having made an impact, with our stakeholders and having gained consumers' share and improved system economics. With that operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Thank you, Operator, and good morning everyone.\nJames Quincey: Good morning.\nBryan Spillane: So John, maybe you want to pick up a little bit on some of the commentary related to the outlook and into 2021. And I understand it's early. But I think a lot of investors are trying to figure out or -- the game, how quickly you can get back to the high watermark so kind of 2019 levels and kind of what that path looks like in 2021. So maybe if you could help us a little bit with, some of the puts and takes I guess for next year. There's going to be some cost savings. There's some discretionary spend that might have to come back, so maybe if you could just kind of help us a little bit with, what those building blocks will look like for next year.\nJohn Murphy: Sure. Bryan thanks for the question. It's still early and there's as we talked on the call a fair degree of uncertainty remaining. And we'll have certainly a lot more to visibility I think when we get to the fourth quarter call. In the meantime, as we just discussed 2021 will be an unusual year. We're cycling a number of unusual impacts from this year. We will see a step-up in our discretionary spending, as we go into the fourth quarter and into the first half of next year. And we're also going to I believe see the benefit from the strategic initiatives that we have outlined in the July and on this morning's call. Our new organizational structure will be, well in place at that stage. So I would anchor our spending in 2021 going into 2022 off our 2019 base, and take into account the actions that we have discussed to both drive the top line and to drive greater efficiency, across the organization. And we'll be in a position to talk more in detail, on the Q4 call.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. And I wanted to talk maybe a little bit longer term, because you have announced and have been discussing on today's call just a tremendous amount of change that, you're introducing not just to your organization immediately, but also to the broader system, all at a time when everyone needs to be nimble and quick in adapting to what's right in front of them and the near-term reality. So, I guess one, could you just talk a little bit about what you're hearing across the system, in terms of comfort, or excitement, or fear about the changes, the ability to absorb? And then also, how may you describe kind of your long-term view? Pre-COVID you were already optimistic. Post-COVID we're looking at a world maybe with a smaller footprint and smaller traffic around away-from-home. So how would you describe kind of your long-term view today versus maybe what it was 12 months ago? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Look, the headline is, we're more confident today, in the long-term growth potential of the company and the bottling system than we were pre-COVID. And the reason I say that is, look as we came into the crisis, we'd obviously done a lot of things reinvested in Coke re-franchised. And we had launched the total beverage strategy with Beverages for Life. And we were starting to get traction. We were starting to see the business both the company and the bottlers get up towards the higher end of our long-term growth model and come off several years, of good revenue growth and starting to see the earnings take off in dollar terms for the company, in EPS and for the bottlers as well. And building off that strategy of Beverages for Life, the actions we're taking this year really being very focused on what are the brands that can take us into the future. As John said, we're going to we're letting go half more -- slightly more than half of the brand, so we can focus on those with the greatest potential. They account for a relatively small amount of revenue and profit, but they take up a disproportionate to that amount of time, process and shelf space. So the focus on, the portfolio the updating and change to the marketing model, as John mentioned, not just the efficiency but the effectiveness of the model, with the new organization, with the new networked organization and with the Platform Services. These actions are helping us not just adapt and prosper within the COVID crisis and clearly Q3 was better than Q2. But it's giving us confidence that, we are not only going to emerge from this crisis ahead of the economy overall in a stronger position, but we will be even better setup to drive the Beverages for Life strategy going forward. And I think you can see that play through from the company, into the bottlers. Yes, every country is not equal. But a simple sign is that our third quarter was better, because our equity income was better, which is a direct result of the bottler is doing better in the third quarter. So I think the way the system grasped the nettle in March and April and rapidly shared the learnings, and shared the adaptation strategies has paid dividends for the company and the bottlers during the crisis. And I think we are well set up and are all collectively being proactive in setting ourselves up to be stronger, when this ends whether that's because the bottlers are going to intersect with the upgraded marketing, with deeper execution against revenue growth management, and local execution. Everyone is very focused on the efficiency of the supply chain and the rationalization of the product portfolio will pay dividends through the bottling supply chain. The idea of moving resources from the kind of -- the back office on to the feet on the street will pay dividends in the bottling system. So I think you see a system in sync philosophically. And driving the changes needed to both win in the crisis and emerge stronger. And I believe we're in a better position the company and the bottlers today to be stronger in the long term than we were precrisis. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. \nNik Modi: Yes, good morning everyone. So James I was wondering if you could just help us understand just kind of two things. Some of the work we've done with just local players are making some inroads in terms of market share and this is mainly in the emerging markets. So I want to understand the tension between your kind of SKU footprint or your brand footprint and the need to be local so you can compete with some of these local competitors. And then just -- I guess I wanted more clarity on what's the timeline? Like how do you think about the failing fast phenomenon that you've been discussing for the past several quarters, how much time are you going to give new initiatives before you decide you're going to ax them? Because sometimes you have to stick with an idea to kind of build it, but I just wanted to get your perspective around that. \nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean market share -- firstly our headline approach on market share is to win in the channels that are open. I mean it's -- we've talked about it on the last quarter it's clear. And so we have a stronger position in away-from-home channels and a higher share in away-from-home channels than we have in at-home channels and therefore mechanically as those have closed down and locked down we kind of mechanically lose share. So what we have focused on is to say to the system we must focus on winning share in the channels that are open. Because then as the world recovers -- and I'm a strong believer that as the world recovers with the fact that we are social animals means we will mix and mingle. Some of these channels will evolve and not -- they won't all come back in the same way, but away-from-home will come back and humans will go out and socialize and do lots of things. Because they want the experiences they're not going to stay stuck at home. So it will come back. So we're focused on winning share in the channels that are open and so we have been winning share in the -- for the at-home channels. And that is true across the board. That's true across many, many, many of the countries. It's very rare to win in every country all the time, but we have been winning broadly across the world in the at-home channel. And so -- and I think you've seen commentary about how bigger brands and people have been returning to the brands they know and love from other categories and other sectors too. So I think that that's very much what's going on. And as we look forward to kind of the focus on going forward the reduction of the portfolio by about half is actually going to allow us to bring more stronger innovation to the table. This is not about less innovation and less ability to tap into local insights it's actually about leveraging the most successful vehicles to do that. So already this year, we have seen the revenue per innovation double versus what we had last year. So it is about combining the platforms and the global and regional brands and the platforms to connect to local insights and that is part of the art of bringing it to life. And of course in terms of how long do you wait before you pull some of these innovations we have some pretty clear metrics. Of course the first thing is to decide what's the innovation for, what's its objective? It could be -- we talked on the call are we trying to get into a new category, are we trying to get -- are we trying to do a flavor extension on the existing brand, is it a packaging innovation, what sort of innovations are we talking about. But each one has its mission and has its goals and we are very focused on tracking how it's doing and we'll sunset it as and when hope is no longer there or rational hope is no longer there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nSteve Powers: Hey thanks, good morning. Maybe you could pick up on some of what you were speaking to Lauren about and drill down a level. I'm wondering if you could talk about the organization's reaction internally to the announcements made over the last few months just around restructuring and the pivot more formally to a networked model and Platform Services etcetera. I'm curious if you've been able to do any formal feedback or capture any formal feedback from employees in that regard? And if so, if you found the reactions to vary at all by region or function or make you more or less encouraged. Any feedback from the organization at large would be great to hear that? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Look firstly the two big things to say about that. Firstly of course, we have not reached the end of the process. We have gone -- made a decision very early on to make this redesign more in the open. I mean often restructurings are done in the room by a few people and then announced to everyone. That's not what we have done. We have decided that we are going to enroll enlist and engage with a much much broader piece of the organization to make sure the design is what we want. And so therefore you have a more public -- a longer public timeline which is what we're in. We have gone through a large part of the voluntary separation plan, but we have not completely finished the design and we are still working on that. But all of that leads to the obvious conclusion that a lot of the feedback is around uncertainty and when will I know what happens to me which is completely and totally understandable and we are working as fast as we can to provide as much certainty as possible. So that is still ongoing. And as John commented we expect the large majority of all of that to have been completed for the clarity by the end of the year. Some parts of the world not given local consultation requirements. But the -- when you stand back from the restructuring process, when you take the feedback from the employees and we've done surveys and both formal and informal, in the end you're going to end up with two types of feedback. You're either going to get a type of feedback which is, I don't understand what we're trying to do or I don't understand how we're going to do it yet. And the very encouraging thing about where we've got to so far is, there's a great deal of clarity in the employee base around the strategic reasons to do what we're doing and how it will help improve and drive the business. And there's a -- certainly from the people that have been announced leaders at the top piece of their network they have -- they also have that very clear and are very energized about bringing it to life. So the majority of the questions the vast majority of the questions are on how is it going to come to life and of course what does this mean to me which is an encouraging sign. It's a natural reaction, but it's also an encouraging sign that this is on track to deliver the sorts of benefits and support the ability of the company and the system to drive the top line. And the feedback from the bottlers is also positive on how this will help them and we will collectively as a system be stronger. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. \nDara Mohsenian: Hi, good morning. So James I was hoping to review the restructuring program in a bit more detail. First, maybe just can you give us a sense and help us better understand how the program came about. How much of the reorganization plans that were announced were in process pre-COVID or are already in the back of your mind and would play out over time versus how much impact COVID may have had on changing your plans?  And then conceptually just to help us give us some perspective for how significant you think changes under this program will be operationally in your organization maybe a sense relative to past restructurings and sort of your enthusiasm for the ultimate fundamental as well as execution payback from the program. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. The thinking behind where we're going predates COVID. In fact, we had a senior leadership meeting with the top 200 in February before the crisis became completely apparent where we started to talk about what would it take to bring a much more networked organization to life and started to talk about some of the dimensions. So the idea of the reorganization, the purpose of being a networked organization predates COVID.  And it's a logical consequence from starting to bring the Beverages for Life strategy to life no pun intended. So it is very much a continuation of where we're going. It's an agenda item that was clear. It was coming. Obviously in February, we were at the relative beginning stages. What the time of COVID particularly Q2 what that did to influence the program was really a couple of things. One, it was clear that when we took the actions to refocus the system on safety and continuity of supply in Q2, the clarity of moving quickly on refocusing on fewer SKUs and the boldness of those decisions are paid off very quickly. And the insight was not just that, but the ability of the organization to act with speed was very encouraging. That led us to conclude that we should accelerate even in the course of the pandemic the move to the networked organization and really drive that forward and push that on. And so that's what we've done.  As I just said on the last call, we're largely through it. Of course, the other thing that came out of pandemic was a decision to try and make it as enrolling and engaging with the organization as possible even at the risk of having a longer period of uncertainty because the design is more in the public. And I think that has proven to be very powerful in helping us optimize the design of what we want. And so that increases our confidence level that it will be another key component to helping us emerge stronger from the crisis and get up to the top range of the long-term growth model. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Carlos Laboy with HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nCarlos Laboy: Yes. Good morning, everyone. James you have several new presidents including new heads for the U.S., Latin America and Europe. How might their respective divisions change under their new leadership? What might be some of the top opportunities that you wish for each of these individuals to focus on? \nJames Quincey: Yes. They're not all new to the parts of the world they're in. Obviously, Nikolaos who is leading Europe was leading EMEA before which obviously included Europe. So very much in the case of Europe, which was doing very well. Nikolaos represents a great deal of strategic continuity. And obviously self-evidently in the case of Europe we have the challenges of not just the expansion of the portfolio and success in the categories, but also the recovery of the away-from-home channel. So -- but there's a great deal of leadership continuity in Europe.  In the case of Latin America, Henrique who's now leading Latin America was leading the Brazilian business and Brazil is the star performer so far this year. And that is not just a consequence of the actions they've been taking in the short-term. The Brazilian system us with the bottlers have been very focused on responding to what several years ago was a very deep recession or depression in the Brazilian economy doubling down on the brand portfolio, doubling down on affordability through big investments with the bottlers in returnable packaging looking at execution and coolers. And that is paying dividends this year and helping drive Brazil to be the best-performing business unit so far in terms of absolute growth. And so Henrique deeply knows Latin America and the strategic challenges that we have there and will be fully capable to lead there.  And then Alfredo is coming in to the U.S., where we have been on a good track in terms of driving the portfolio and gaining share in the U.S. business. And certainly, we're hoping to continue the best of everything that was happening in the U.S. before, but also infuse it with some of the thinking from Latin America whether that be around revenue growth management particularly in the economic times we're in, some of the sharpness on the portfolio and on the margins and working with the bottlers as well on the supply chain. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. John, a quick housekeeping question. And then James, a question on seltzers. So the housekeeping question is you indicated marketing spend was below last year's levels, but sort of picking up sequentially. Can you frame the magnitude for us either year-over-year or as a percent of sales?  James, the broader question is on the Topo Chico launch in hard seltzers specifically in the U.S. Just maybe spend a little bit of time how the agreement with Molson Coors came about and why you determined they're the right partner? How the Coca-Cola Company is defining success in the category? Is there a specific market share ambition? And then more broadly how do you plan to differentiate in an increasingly crowded category what is Topo Chico's proverbial right to win? So thanks to offer all that.\nJohn Murphy : First, the housekeeper here. 30% decline year-over-year. But Q3 and Q2, showed -- I don't have the number exactly in front of me but showed about 65% on 30% from Q3 over Q2. So we continue to look at that sequential improvement Kevin quarter-to-quarter. And I'd expect Q4 based on what we're seeing around the world to \u2013 for us to continue to have targeted investments in those markets where it makes sense to do so. And as I said earlier, as you look at 2021, I would encourage you to think about 2019 as an anchor. And then from there factor in the work that we have underway on the marketing area, particularly marketing innovation to drive greater efficiency. We know there's a lot of opportunity when you wire the organization together. And the way we're doing it, it unlocks a lot of opportunity for us to do the same with less or to do more with the same. And that is \u2013 that will be the part of the strategy conversation going into 2021, as to which of the approaches we take on a market-by-market basis.\nJames Quincey: Yes Topo Chico. We're very excited about opportunities in Topo Chico. Obviously, it's a fantastic sparkling mineral water brand and has done very well. The U.S. situation is very unique and specific. Clearly our starting position for innovations is to work with our bottling system. The best result is much more likely in terms of scale and profit to be the nexus between brands that the company owns and drives and go through the bottling system, and that's how we're approaching the Topo Chico Hard Seltzer outside the U.S. In the U.S., it's very specifically driven by the nature of the regulation of the beer market or the alcohol market in the U.S. And many of you I'm sure are familiar with the 3-tier system for the U.S. marketplace, which is unique to the U.S. So we're launching in Latin America with our bottlers. But as it relates to the U.S., we have to find a path within in the 3-tier system. And so that's why we've looked for an external partner or more specifically a partner already in the alcohol industry. It also relates to the fact that having someone who is an existing brewer is a much easier supply chain path into the category. And it also happens to be the case that the network of distributors the Molson Coors has also connects with some of the parallel businesses of people who are connected to the Coke system. So the U.S. structure is very specific to the U.S. regulatory requirements and to the partners who we think can help us drive what's needed for Topo Chico. How do we find success? This is going to be an explorer brand from us. I mean we are for sure clear that what we don't know about the alcohol and Hard Seltzer category is more than what we do know. And we need to continue to work our way to understand these opportunities as much as we did with Lemon-Do in Japan, starting small, learning and then expanding as we got success. And so we will take a very similar approach in the U.S. with Topo Chico Hard Seltzer as to working exactly what connects with consumers and what connects with retailers. And in terms of differentiation, clearly there's going to be differentiation through the flavors, through the product itself, through the packaging. But also I think it builds on a tremendous strength. I mean Topo Chico is still growing fantastically across the U.S. and is the leading sparkling water brand in places like Texas. So I think that the brand itself is an established iconic interesting brand for the consumers that are interested in Hard Seltzer. So I think it's everything there indicates that it should be a great opportunity, we just need to bring it to life.\nJohn Murphy: And Kevin just to clarify, when I said the 65%, 65% was Q2 over prior year and Q3 was 30%.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. And so my question is more on what you can control on the reinvestment commentary in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year. John, should we be thinking that would continue to be fully financed by the restructuring savings? In other words, should we expect your operating margins to continue to move in the right direction in 2021, given the cost savings and the mix improving? Thank you.\nJohn Murphy: So I think we need to \u2013 you need to think about 2020 as being a very unusual year in which we have obviously been able to manage very tightly our cost base through the pandemic and particularly through the worst phases of it, which in turn has allowed us to deliver operating margin improvements that are out of the normal pattern you would expect. I would encourage you to think about our long-term growth model has been the \u2013 again the anchor. Embedded in our long-term growth model is a belief that we can over time continue to expand margins. And the actions that we are taking, which will have an impact in 2021 going into 2022 also, those actions are I believe will allow us to deliver on that algorithm as we go forward. So again, 2021 versus 2020, we're going to be cycling an unusual set of circumstances. And I think that needs to be appropriately factored in to the models that you will be deploying.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning. Can you just give me \u2013 give us a little more color on the master brand reduction. And when I say that I understand that it's only 1% of kind of total revenue but maybe where that's dispersed in terms of is there one geography that's going to see more cuts? Is there a bigger hit, as we're kind of looking at our models from certain areas? And then also just trying to understand these \u2013 I know they don't generate a lot of revenue but they certainly are occupying some shelf space. So how quickly can you replace that shelf space? Or is there any risk that that shelf space is taken by competitors who see some free space? Or just help me understand kind of the color on how it really affects the revenue model over the next maybe six to 12 months.\nJames Quincey: Yeah. So the brands themselves are distributed across the categories probably slightly more in the hydration space than any of the other -- of sparkling coffee and tea or juice dairy and plant. But the brands are distributed across all the different categories. They tend to be much more local in terms of brands. And so two things are going to happen. One, there's going to be some brands we're going to retire. But there are some brands where the better answer is to transition it into one of the regional brands. So it might be we have a strong regional juice brand and then there's a local brand in one market and we're going to transition it into the regional brand because it's going to be much more efficient and effective to leverage the marketing and the innovation but from that regional brand rather than repeating everything into the local brand. So the -- we're talking mainly about the very tail and a much more local brand tail but brands that are spread across multiple categories. Clearly our objective is to convert the shelf space from these brands into ones that we own. Some of that has already effectively happened because of COVID. In the Q2 in particular in order to preserve the effectiveness of the supply chain, we already stopped making a set of SKUs including some of the brands and captured that shelf space for our main brands. Other places where it's a transition from a local brand to a regional or a global brand clearly we'll be managing that with the customers so we would not expect to lose shelf space. I think in simple terms of the revenue model, the benefits -- I would think about it is the benefits we're going to get from freeing up that shelf space and freeing up the process and innovation time of those brands should be made up by -- at least made up by existing global or regional brands. And I would not -- I certainly am not starting to think that this is a headwind to results in the next six to 12 months I would just assume that we're going to make it all up with the portfolio we have.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. A couple of questions on some of your commentary. When you are talking about being at the high end of your algorithm, because of the structural changes that you've made, or more because as we go into 2021 obviously there's a very unique comparison for this year? And also I believe the commentary for share repurchase is new. If that's the case can you maybe just provide a little more context on what you're seeing in terms of cash flow and balance sheet that makes you feel comfortable to be talking about a potential share repurchase at this juncture? Thank you.\nJohn Murphy: So let me take that. On the last point there's actually no change in our views on share repurchase. I think it's very consistent with what we've talked about on previous calls, our priorities as we look ahead are to reinvest in the business and to continue to support the dividend. We continue to have an opportunistic view on the M&A front, although don't expect a whole lot on that on the horizon there. And share repos have really -- was our number fourth on the on the priority list and we expect them to stay there for the foreseeable future. So that's on that point. Regarding the higher end of the algorithm, yeah, I think 2021 is -- we're going to be cycling a set of unusual factors. My view on the algorithm I think James will share this too is that we're talking about getting back to the higher end of the algorithm. As you think about the -- over the next -- over the mid-term. So the higher end when I think about the algorithm I'm looking at a 2022 versus 2019. 2021 versus 2020 is going to produce a not usual set I think of results. But that's to be expected given what's happened particularly in Q2 and in Q3.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you. Just a point of clarification on the brand reduction what kind of impact will that have if any on working capital? And does that help you get where you want to go? And then my main question is on trademark Coke, which looked very, very strong. Can you give us more color on that, what you're doing to grow share despite the fact that you brought advertising down and where you see the brand equity today compared to last year? Thank you.\nJohn Murphy: Let me take the working capital question. Minimal impact overall. There's a real opportunity here to clean up our internal supply chain end-to-end. So when you think about the amount of small purchases that are required to support these brands that are -- that represent the long end of the tail it's a pretty sizable number, but relative to our overall working capital it's not that material. But it certainly gives us a little bit of a tailwind as we go into 2021.\nJames Quincey: Yeah on Coke, I mean, look firstly, while we have been judicious in our use of marketing spend in Q2 particularly but also in Q3 we have continued to market including marketing strongly behind the Coke brand. So we have continued to market. Clearly that's also been linked by great work with the bottlers on some revenue growth management, particularly affordability plays in some parts of the world, adjusting the portfolio, the packaging portfolio given the skew to at-home channels in many other parts of the world, good local execution. So there is continued focus and investment behind Coke. And I think that's clearly paying dividends as we've gone from Q2 to Q3. So as you pointed out in Q3 Coke is growing. Coke is gaining share. And that is also being powered by an ongoing focus on Coke Zero Sugar where that grew high single digits in the third quarter in terms of volume. So we are clearly continuing to invest behind Coke among many of the other brands. And we see the brand responding and doing well and believe as we increase investment into the fourth quarter and into 2021, that Coke will continue to be a motor of growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBonnie Herzog: Hi. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I just had a quick question on North America. Your price/mix in the quarter was especially strong relative to expectations. So could you drill down a little bit more on the key drivers of the strength, especially, since it looks like you took some pricing? And then, really, how should we think about this going forward in the context of mix and, especially, if we see some of the pressures in the on-premise channel getting better? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. Yes. Obviously, it was pleasing in the third quarter to see the price/mix from North America. Firstly, that was -- got a big component being driven by our focus on some of the premium offerings, whether that be Simply or fairlife which -- and some of the finished goods businesses we own. So, obviously, there's a sort of -- there's good news, because we're driving premium categories or subcategories, but also recognize that some of that is finished goods products that we are selling. And that offset some of the pressures we feel in fountain channels and in other away-from-home channels. So it's good news. I'm not sure that we'll always do 4%, but it's being driven in part by this mix effect of the different finished goods versus non-finished goods and fountain business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sean King from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nSean King: Good morning. You said that FX would have a minimal impact on your preliminary 2021 outlook. I guess how much variability could still exist? And are you hedged on the G10 currencies into 2021 at this point? And then, on top of that any color you can provide on your inflation outlook, given aluminum and freight rising recently.\nJohn Murphy: Yes. So with regard to 2021, we are substantially hedged on the G10 currencies. And as we've discussed in prior calls, the bigger variable and point of volatility is what happens to the large emerging currencies, particularly in Latin America and in Africa. So to the extent that they stay pretty solid and will be in -- as I said, we would see minimal impact. And then, with regard to the commodity situation, this year has been a favorable year for us on the commodity front. And we would expect 2021 based on the latest estimates we have on the various components to be pretty even with 2020. And to your point on aluminum, in particular, there'll be maybe just a slight favorability based on what we see at the moment. We do see on PET, there will be some -- I think some slight increases, but we can manage those with other offsets inside of the cost of goods line.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet from Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLaurent Grandet: Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for squeezing me in the lineup. So I got a question about the U.S. fountain business. While the particularity of the U.S. business is that, you own the fountain business and in the current circumstances and with the broader strategy, the reflection you have on your organization, I wanted to understand if you envisage refranchising the fountain business there and managing the same way you do, I mean, outside of the U.S. And what was the rationale to keep it in-house? And how are you adjusting that piece of the business to be more agile and support the overall goal you have set for the company post-COVID? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yes. It was a little difficult to hear you there Laurent, but I think you're asking a question about the U.S. fountain business and how it's doing. I mean, clearly, it's a big part of the operation. It's about 30% of the volume in the U.S. and it's a very important package format or channel intersection. Clearly, it's been heavily affected by the COVID crisis. And within that QSRs have clearly been at the better end, whereas things related to transport and amusement have been -- continue to be at the more impacted end. But we very much manage the business not just to do the best for each and every one of the customers that use the fountain equipment, but as one of the packaging formats that brings our brands to life. So the brand strategies are holistic and look across the different packaging formats and different channel formats and we continue to think that that business will be a prosperous business with a good road to recovery. \nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks. \nJames Quincey: Thank you, operator. So in conclusion, we think during the third quarter we began to see some encouraging signs of recovery from the global lockdown. We also made progress in transforming our organizational structure to better position the Coca-Cola system to pursue our Beverages for Life strategy. These steps will enable us to scale a portfolio of drinks that will help us emerge stronger and win in this ever-changing marketplace. So as always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us today. Thank you. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first and then re-enter the queue. Now, let me turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Tim, and good morning everyone. We\u2019ve just closed the books on what has arguably been the toughest and most complex quarter in Coca-Cola history. And given the global pandemic, of course, this comes as no surprise. From the initial lockdowns and closures of hundreds of thousands of our customer outlets to the gradual reopening and now another round of spikes in various countries, the impacts have been profound. In this challenging environment, we\u2019ve seen some remarkable actions around the world. And I\u2019d like to express my thanks to the countless people on the frontlines who are working to improve our communities worldwide. And I\u2019d also like to recognize my colleagues across The Coca-Cola Company and our bottling system for their tireless efforts in prioritizing the safety of our people, ensuring the resiliency of our supply chain, supporting our millions of customers globally, and for being a force of good in their communities. As we navigated the quarter, we used a combination of focus and flexibility to manage through what we believe will be the peak levels of global lockdown. John will discuss the results in further detail, but as you think about the quarter and consider the future, I\u2019d like to highlight the strong relationship of our performance with the intersection of two key factors. The trajectory of our business trends in the near term is closely linked to the size of our away-from-home business in any given country and the level of lockdowns in the market. For example, markets like Western Europe, which had high levels of restrictions and a meaningful away-from-home exposures; and in India, which had an intense lockdown, experienced significant impacts. However, many of our Latin American markets with less restrictive measures and a lower away-from-home presence fared better. Further as we went through the quarter and restrictions generally eased globally, our business saw improvements from the 25% volume declines in April to the single-digit declines we are seeing now in July. The lockdowns also affected our share performance in the quarter. Our underlying performance in NARTD was positive and benefited from strong share gains in the at-home channel. However, this was entirely offset by a full point of negative channel mix due to the away-from-home pressure where we have strong shares. And as on-premise begins to revive, we fully expect to return to share growth, and we are already seeing sequential improvements in monthly trends. Moving forward, we are maintaining that same level of focus on flexibility that helped us navigate the quarter as we focus on winning during the reopening phases. Thankfully, a good starting point matters. As a system, we went into the crisis in a strong position and the system has rallied. There is a sense of optimism about what is possible as we move forward. Importantly, we are leveraging the crisis as a catalyst to accelerate the business transformation that was already underway, and we remain guided by our purpose, which is to refresh the world and make a difference, and we are clear on how we will emerge stronger. We will win more consumers, gain share, maintain strong system economics, strengthen our impact across our stakeholders, and equip our organization to win in the future. And as we think about that future, there are two important points I\u2019d like to make. In addition to the near-term realities of the pandemic and consumer shifts, the uncertainty around the trajectory of the macroeconomic environment is significant. We generally align with forecasts that imply the global economy could take 2 to 3 years to fully recover. Notwithstanding the macros and NorthStar its return to pre-COVID levels and to do this ahead of the economic recovery. Second, we see the underlying structural reasons that Beverages for Life strategy with the consumer at the heart of everything we do remains essential. The commercial beverage industry will remain vibrant in the years to come. We know consumers will continue to spend more on commercial beverages and they will continue to demand greater choice. This drives the need for a broad, strong portfolio and a powerful scaled distribution system to supply that demand. Our Beverages for Life vision began a transformation of the organization, supported by a refreshed culture focused on a growth mindset. We are already well on our way down this path and seeing good results. The pandemic is prompting us to move even faster. At CAGNY, earlier this year, we introduced the key elements of our strategy to accelerate top-line growth and maximize returns. We recognize that some elements need to evolve and others need to be pushed harder to reflect the new reality. So, we are accelerating our strategy across five priorities. First, we are prioritizing a portfolio that combines strong global brands plus regional and scaled local brands to address critical age cohorts, need [indiscernible] and drinking occasions. Second, we are establishing a more disciplined innovation framework and a new path forward for increased marketing effectiveness and efficiency. Third, we are strengthening our RGM and execution capabilities to drive relevance and responsiveness. And to capitalize on these initiatives, we are enhancing our system collaboration and capturing supply chain efficiencies to fuel growth. And as a result, we are continuing to evolve our organization to support the accelerated strategy and invest in new capabilities to accomplish these objectives. John will discuss how we are leveraging each of these initiatives to drive improved return and prioritize our capital allocation to the most attractive opportunities.  Turning to the portfolio. At the outset of the pandemic, our goal was to ruthlessly prioritize core brands and SKUs to strengthen the resilience of our supply chain. In China, we placed a big emphasis on our sparkling portfolio during the height of the lockdown. And as a result, the category grew 14% in volume this quarter, led by trademark Coke with strong growth in Zero Sugar offerings. The learnings from the last several months and the insights from our already accelerated SKU rationalization has convinced us to go even deeper on this opportunity by streamlining brands. We are shifting to prioritizing fewer but bigger and stronger brands across various consumer needs. At the same time, we need to do a better job nurturing and growing smaller, more enduring propositions and exiting some zombie brands not just zombie SKUs. As a reference point, of our 400 master brands, more than half are single-country brands with little to no scale. The total combined revenue of those brands is approximately 2% of our total. They\u2019re growing slower than the company average but each one still requires resources and investments. So in the case of a brand like Odwalla and its chilled direct store delivery, which has struggled over the last several years, we started to stop operations effective July 31. This gives us the flexibility to support our investments in brands like Minute Maid and Simply and to continue to scale rising stars like Topo Chico. Turning to innovation and marketing. Innovation remains critical to our Beverages for Life strategy and launch activity has been on the rise over several years. While this expansion of innovation has been a considerable growth driver for the Coke system, many launches failed to escape the tail and struggled to grow. We can do better. We believe the best way forward is to be more choiceful and target bigger, more scalable bets and be disciplined in our experimentation. Over time, our Leader, Challenger and Explorer brands can grow to positions that deliver scale and profitability. We are raising the bar and adding more discipline to our innovation pipeline against the fine criterias, either recruiting new consumers, increasing the frequency of existing consumers and/or being margin accretive. We are leading with global bets like the continued opportunity with reduced-sugar offerings in brand Coke. We also continue a high potential regional and local bets like AHA-flavored sparkling water in the U.S. AHA captured double-digit retail value share in its first 18 week and has even more potential given its wide appeal. With consumers prioritizing health, safety and hygiene even more, there is a runway for innovation in functional benefits and contactless solutions. We\u2019ll prioritize innovation centers on products, packaging and equipment. Last week, for example, we announced the introduction of touchless Freestyle machines in the U.S., which allows consumers to choose and pour drinks from their phones in just a few seconds without the need to create an account or download an app. This is an example of leveraging increased flexibility to create a solution, test it and roll it out in a few months. In addressing our marketing effectiveness and efficiency, we are targeting several areas to improve how we do things. In effect, taking a fresh approach to ensure all our investments have a future role. We are increasing our focus on the cut through quality of our messages and their alignment with in-market execution plans through purpose-driven occasion-based initiatives. The next phase of our global campaign that started with the pandemic is going live now with a large program pairing Coca Meal. Together Tastes Better will kick off in the U.S. that will be rolled out globally. Open to that are another holistic program, invites the world to enjoy the simple and important things in life and will also be introduced this summer across multiple media channels. These campaigns are designed to be flexible and were created for Coca-Cola teams around the world to tailor and localize their markets and platforms. They\u2019re prime examples of how driving maximum impact on rates with focused investment. Further, on the efficiency side, we are pushing our marketing ratios and reassessing our overall marketing return on investment on everything from ad viewership across traditional media to improving effectiveness in digital. Turning to RGM and execution. Beyond these brand and innovation initiatives, we are deploying our capabilities in revenue growth management and execution to adapt to changing channel dynamics. Providing beverages people desire at a price they can afford is increasingly important, given the macroeconomic pressures could be substantial and enduring. By segmenting our markets to provide solutions to fit every budget, revenue growth management also creates opportunity to deliver value through more profitable channels and premium packages. RGM is not just about price. It is about offering a range of solutions to consumers at every part of the value chain and balancing profitability to maintain and grow our consumer base. In the case of Latin America, we\u2019re moving quickly to increase our refillable offerings to address affordability. At the same time, in Japan, we\u2019re working to decouple the 500 ml Coke offering to a larger and smaller pack options to help drive both transactions and enhance our revenue per case. Beyond RGM, we are working with our bottling partners to improve execution by addressing changing channel dynamics and supporting our customers, be it through periods of elevated demand like we\u2019ve seen in grocery and modern trade or the lockdown-related challenges we\u2019re seeing in on-premise spots. In Europe, we\u2019re launching a new campaign, Open Like Never Before as a means to support on-premise reopenings as well as smaller independent outlets and at-home occasions. In the U.S., we\u2019ve helped over 300,000 of our foodservice outlets manage through the lockdown and now we are there to help them get back and be stronger than ever through initiatives like our rapid response resource. We are continuing to invest heavily in executing digital strategies to drive sales, efficiencies, and data analytics across our business. We recently appointed a Global VP of offline to online digital transformation to work closely with leaders across the system to unify and scale our e-commerce and digital strategy. We are aggressively going up in the omnichannel opportunity with the consumer at the center. Partnering with a large e-commerce platform in China, we increased our system revenue through that customer by 65% during the recent 618 Festival, the largest mid-year shopping festival in China. Our partnerships with third-party aggregators are driving incidents as consumers quickly migrate to mobile delivery for groceries and prepared meals. For instance, working with large restaurant delivery intermediaries in North America, we added value bundles to over 4,500 restaurant venues in the quarter. We\u2019re also accelerating our B2B platforms to streamline the value chain with modern trade. In the U.S., we\u2019ve added more than 8,000 outlets to the myCoke digitized ordering platform just this quarter, allowing a contactless relationship with our customers. Finally, we\u2019re experimenting with direct-to-consumer by expanding platforms like Coca-Cola Into Our World throughout Latin America. This web-based solution delivers to homes as quickly as the next day and currently enjoys one million household users at a healthy double-digit growth rate. To execute these initiatives with speed and effectiveness, we\u2019ve worked closely with our bottling partners through the crisis. The connectivity across the system has been extraordinary. In the last few months, we\u2019ve held global and regional system meetings with leadership, allowing us to accomplish even more than we thought possible. We will continue this increased engagement and sharing of best practices with our bottlers from top to bottom post-pandemic as we recognize the opportunity to collaborate even more closely across the supply chain and to leverage our collective global scale. Ultimately, we aspire to grow faster system-wide and deliver stronger results that will enable us to continue investing and putting our purpose into action. Turning to the organization. Since we set out on the Beverages for Life journey, we have evolved our organization every step of the way and we continue to do so to ensure structure follows strategy. To focus on a growth portfolio of profitable brands with quality leadership positions that is supported by an efficient and effective marketing model, we need to be flexible. Our system is continuing to move further away from a complicated three dimensional organizational structure to more of a network model, improving our agility and maximizing scale. As the pandemic acts as a catalyst to accelerate our strategy, our organization is moving into the future faster too. And we must set up properly to empower our system to win. This will require us to reallocate people resources and could mean some reductions due to our evolving approach. There is no doubt that we faced significant pressures in the second quarter but we exited the quarter with promising signs the most challenging period is indeed behind us in much of the world. There is still a lot of work to do. There is no doubt the world will be different following the crisis. In many ways, the future is coming at us faster than ever. We are embracing the changes and pivoting our business to take advantage of new opportunities. We are poised as a system to accelerate our transformation to return to driving growth in years to come. Before I hand the call over to John, I\u2019d like to take a moment to comment on the social justice movements that had significant impacts around the world. Let me be clear, our stance is there is no place for racism or institutionalized inequality in the world. We are taking an active approach and focusing our efforts on listening, leading, investing and advocating. We are engaging stakeholders, employees and other business leaders and we\u2019ve paused social media for the time being while we review our policies to ensure a higher level of accountability and transparency. We recently committed to spend an incremental $500 million with black-owned suppliers and are actively contributing to communities on this important issue. With that, John will discuss our results and provide more details on how we plan to drive returns as our increased focus provides the flexibility we need.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to spend my time this morning focused on three things. One, some commentary on the quarter and the rest of year outlook. Two, thoughts on the broader and longer-term implications to value creation for our company and our system. And, finally, on our capital allocation priorities. As expected, our second quarter was one with significant hurdles to overcome as lockdown and social distancing requirements placed profound pressures on our customers and consumers. In the second quarter, volumes were down 16% driven by declines in higher revenue per case away-from-home channels. Organic revenues declined 26% driven by a 22% decline in concentrate shipments and a 4% decline in price/mix. The gap between concentrate shipments and unit cases this quarter is attributable to cycling the timing of shipments from last year, primarily in EMEA and Latin America, along with rationalization of stock levels after some safety stock building in the first quarter. The majority of the price/mix pressure during the quarter was driven by segment mix from meaningful declines in our cost of business in Global Ventures, as well as Bottling Investments. Underlying gross margin was down approximately 300 basis points, primarily driven by volume declines in capital intensive finished goods businesses like Costa, foodservice in North America and our Bottling Investments, in addition to negative package and channel mix pressure. Despite the significant pressure of top-line and gross margin, in addition to the currency headwinds, comparable operating margins were only slightly lower than last year, given the effective management of our SG&A expenses. While we had a considerable amounts of leverage during the quarter from cost management, part of it is attributable to timing due to modifying our full-year marketing spend forecast, which included an adjustment from the first quarter. As we look to the remainder of the year, we will continue to hold off on providing full year guidance, given the amounts of uncertainty that remains. That said, there are some factors worth highlighting as you think about the second half. While we believe the second quarter will be the most severely impacted, we do expect the top-line trajectory to continue to correlate closely to the level of mobility of consumers and the health of the away-from-home channels, as James discussed earlier. The pandemic is not behind us. There is still good reason to be cautious as global COVID infections continue to increase with case growth generally shifting from developed to emerging markets. While we are seeing sequential improvements, recovery will likely not to be linear. Some markets that were recovering are having a second spike in cases like we\u2019re seeing in Iran, Australia, Romania and here in the United States. Depending on the trajectory of recovery in away-from-home, channel and package mix will continue to put pressure on our gross margin. At the same time, while we do expect continued cost savings in the back half, the amount of leverage should moderate as we look to accelerate our marketing investments, given improving ROI characteristics in a number of markets. I\u2019d also add that if the top-line improves faster than expectations, we are prepared to reinvest more aggressively to further strengthen our position heading into 2021. And finally, moving to below the line, in an effort to extend the duration of our outstanding debt in the first half, we issued $11.5 billion of long-term maturities, resulting in higher interest expense. While we firmly believe this is the right thing to do longer term, you will continue to see a year-over-year increase in interest expense in the back half of the year. James laid out the approach we are taking on the portfolio, innovation, marketing, execution and system efficiencies to return our company to top-line growth at the high end of our growth algorithm. We believe strongly in our future being propelled by top-line growth, but we also appreciate the top-line must ultimately create value that meets or exceeds our shareholder expectations. To this end, we are focused on the following critical objectives. First, we are defining, even more sharply, the optimal set of our P&L and balance sheet. We have developed a clear mission, strategic drivers and financial expectations for each of our business segments and have set objectives to improve margins and free cash flow across the board. We\u2019ll leverage these improved returns and invest what is needed to fund continued growth, while ensuring our balance sheet remains fit for purpose for our future needs. Second, opportunities abound because of this more efficient growth. As James discussed earlier, we are moving with speed to optimize marketing spend, consolidated behind our growth portfolio and business segment priorities. Using our productivity mindset, we are continuing to uncover cost saving opportunities across the supply chain and operating expenses. While the hallmark of our business is winning locally with our consumers and customers, we continue to see opportunities to scale several services across the system to unlock synergies. In addition, as we evolve the organization to follow the strategy, this too will drive better resource allocation. And as James mentioned, our global system will continue to collaborate as our strategy accelerates and evolves and together, we are working to be nimbler to sustain the growth that follows. As we pursue these objectives, our capital allocation priorities remain the same \u2013 reinvest for appropriates in the business to drive momentum and continue to grow the dividend, returning cash to our shareholders. M&A and share repurchase are unlikely to play a prominent role in the near term. Our balance sheet is strong and we remain confident in our liquidity position as we continue to navigate through the crisis. As we work through the system to manage through the current challenges caused by COVID-19, our bottlers are not immune to the effects of the business disruption. That said, approximately 80% of our business, volumetrically, is in the hands of our top-15 bottlers or run through our Bottling Investment group. The remaining 20% are small to mid-sized. Our large public bottlers are well managed companies with healthy balance sheets. Nearly all of our small-to-mid-sized bottlers are in a stable position and taking proactive steps in efficient working capital management, expenses and capital to manage the situation. As we close the books on the second quarter, there is no doubt that this has been a challenging time for the Coca-Cola system. Throughout, our system has remained focused on the journey ahead, pivoting and adapting to ensure that we accelerate our transformation, allowing our system to emerge stronger. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBryan Spillane: Hi, thank you, and good morning, everyone.\nJames Quincey: Good morning.\nBryan Spillane: I guess my question is just around the balance between efficiency and growth. We\u2019ve come a long way in the last couple of years to exit last year to be at the top end of the revenue growth algorithm. And I guess, now we\u2019re contemplating trying to get back to that level, but at the same time, with a focus on efficiency. So, James, maybe if you could talk a little bit about organizationally how you\u2019re just going to balance, trying to achieve both of those things at the same time.\nJames Quincey: Yes, thanks. Thanks, Bryan. Look, clearly we've got to do both. If we just aim for top line growth, we \u2013 I'm sure we'll get back up to the top end of the algorithm where we were for the last few years. But if we do that without focusing on efficiency, that's not going to work for the company or work for the bottlers or work for the shareholders. And the inverse is true. If we just stop worrying about the top line and focus on efficiency, we'll do well for a year or 2, but then the wheels will come off. So we've got to do both. And the way we're going to approach it is to really attack the priorities we've talked about. In the good years, the pre-COVID years, we got up to the top end of the revenue growth thing. We were doing a lot of innovation. We were curating a lot of brands. We knew we had things that were working really well and other brands that were struggling. And as we were at the top end of the growth, you\u2019ve seen that we need to not just remove the zombie SKUs but prune down some of the explorer brands so you can refocus on those with most potentials. When times are going well, you set a certain pace for that sort of activity. And now in the COVID times and in these more impaired economic times, for at least for the near future, we need to accelerate that. So that's why we said, look, we need to \u2013 let's really bring forward the agenda of which every wave of innovation generates, you diverge and then you need to converge on the best \u2013 the best product to excel. Let's accelerate that. Let's get really focused. That will also allow us to get more focused and more efficient on how we do the marketing and where we direct the marketing investments. So the 2 things that we\u2019ll work together to both be more able to drive the top line, because we're more able to get back to the sort of growth rates we want, all the top line, and be able to win new consumers and win share in the marketplace and yet do so in a more efficient way. We've also seen over the last number of years, as we've moved to platform services as we've evolved their organization, we can see that we have things that were ahead of us that could also be done, and we're going to accelerate those. Not just as a company, but we're looking for ways as a system, so how can we build on some of the great collaboration that already exists, like the cross-enterprise procurement group, where we buy collectively our core imports, our core commodities. How can we take that to the next level? So, we're really looking for the really \u2013 to build on the learnings of the pre-COVID. We knew we had things that were to \u2013 that had to be done. Let's accelerate those so that we can generate the efficiencies that will both fuel the growth and getting the top line back up and allow us to bridge in terms of resources given that revenue is still impacted in the near term. So it's got to be done, and we're going to \u2013 the last part of that is really it's going to build on the culture of work we have done in recent years to focus on a growth mindset. We've got to keep pushing that idea and keep looking for what's working, and take the resources from the brands and the ideas and the projects that aren't working and funnel them back to those with the most opportunity. So it\u2019s really an end-to-end idea from the consumer backwards through to the structure and the culture of the organization, so that actually you end up with an agenda that's not just a mix of 2 things, strategy and growth and efficiency, but actuallyeach of those components is necessary and enables the other.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping -- you touched a bit, of course on revenue growth management, but I think that\u2019s an area where we've all been, I think, well educated on revenue growth management as a great tool to drive growth in, let's call it, roughly economic expansion. And then in an economic downturn, still probably a bit less explored, the price/mix performance in Latin America, and I think you highlighted Mexico in particular in the press release, was really notable. So, if you could talk a little bit about where you are in terms of implementing revenue growth management strategies to benefit you or to help support the business in a downturn, is Mexico simply a lead market and there's much more to come on that front? But additional color there, I think, could be helpful. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure, sure Lauren. Yes, I mean, interestingly, the whole approach for revenue growth management, certainly in one of its early iterations at the company with the bottlers actually came at times of economic difficulty, particularly in Latin America. So, it is an approach that is a capability, a way of doing things that is just as useful in the good times as it is in the bad times. And so once you see us applying that capability, which the company, together with the bottlers, have spent the last few years refreshing, it's now being directed at the new challenges. And as you say, whereas we might have been putting more emphasis on using it to develop the premium opportunities in the last few years, we're going to have to use it to focus on some of the affordability opportunities. Examples of those is really, for example in Mexico, but also places like Brazil and a number of others, really focusing down on refillable packaging. The benefit of refillable packaging in the context of RGM is, of course, you can \u2013 the economics allow you to offer the product at a lower price point. So we can really connect to what is likely to be some economic stress on disposable income, and therefore the need for affordable products, for refillables and that works in Latin America, that works in Africa, that works in a number of different places. But it also can \u2013 as a capability, RGM can work in countries like Japan. In Japan, we sell a lot of half-liter PET bottles for something like Coke. And in this current environment, what we're going to do is try and split that up. So have one slightly bigger package and one slightly smaller package. The smaller package, obviously, will allow us to offer a lower price point; and the slightly bigger package will be a sharing package which will offer more advantage per liter. And so we can really use this capability to come in and adapt the portfolio, not just in the emerging markets, but also in the developed markets, knowing that, yes, there will still be people looking for premium products and stock up. But there are also people under a lot of disposable income pressure, and there, the number 1 objective, at least in the beverage category for us, is to bring down the entry price point. What's the lowest price at which you can buy a Coke?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning guys.\nJames Quincey: Good morning.\nDara Mohsenian: Just taking a step back, obviously, the June and July to date unit case volume trends showed a significant sequential improvement versus April and May. Do you feel like you have enough visibility that it's reasonable at this point to generally expect sequential progress from those July numbers as we look at the balance of the year and the remainder of the back half? I know you obviously won't give us a specific number, but more conceptually, perhaps you could touch on that. And that's a global question. But within that answer, I was hoping you could parse out thoughts by region a bit more and imagine the answer may be very different in Asia and Europe versus the U.S. and Latin America, just given the relative differences we're seeing in sequential COVID case counts.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I think the simple answer is no. And by no, what I mean is there are too many, to use the famous Rumsfeld little framework, there are too many known unknowns ahead of us. Because whilst, yes, we have seen sequential improvement through the second quarter and into the beginning of July, in all geographies, all major geographies around the world, the principal unknown is the degree of lockdown going forward. As we talked about it in the second quarter, the biggest variables affecting the business were: One, the degree of lockdown; and two, the degree of away-from-home business in that country with the lockdown. And the simple fact remains that while things have got better undoubtedly, July is better than June, June was better than May, May was better than April, the reality remains that the virus is not completely under control. There have been countries which have repeated lockdowns or cities and states within countries that have repeated lockdowns. And so honestly, I think we could \u2013 if we saw the virus starting to be under control, we would imagine, yes, we would see sequential improvement through the months and quarters going forward. But we cannot discount there might be further waves of lockdowns, partial or full. Having said that, I am pretty confident that second quarter will ultimately prove to have been the most difficult and the most impacted quarter, principally because I think the governments are getting smarter about how they apply public health measures and getting things under their control, such that we're unlikely to see the whole world entering a lockdown at the same point in time. I'm not sure that completely helps, but unfortunately, that's the outlook we see, with a strong degree of uncertainty.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nNik Modi: Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. Maybe I could just take another spin on Dara's question and ask specifically on areas where we've seen the virus kind of come back. So you think about Australia, parts of Hong Kong, Texas, et cetera. James, I mean, it's very helpful on understanding kind of the July trends, but things have been moving so quickly. Perhaps you can talk about maybe what you're seeing or just give us some context on some of those markets just so we can get a better understanding of how things have shaped since the end of June.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean, look, the \u2013 I think the fairest thing would be to say that those markets where we've seen repeat lockdowns, they have never \u2013 or they have not yet gone down at the same sort of degree they went down in the first round of their lockdown, whether that be February, March or April. And on a global basis, obviously, April was the most difficult month. So we are not seeing that round 2 is as bad as round 1. I think that if you take somewhere like Japan, which started off with the lockdown and they opened up a bit then they locked down again, yes, the number started getting negative again, but they weren't really as bad as they had been at the initial stage. So you do get a bit of a wiggly line, so you can't \u2013 that's why I made the point on Dara's question, you can't assume, not that I necessarily think you were, you can't assume it was a straight line from where we are now to good. I think there's going to be some variations as you start to look across the months. But the second waves have not yet looked as bad as the first waves, whether I look across any of the countries you really mentioned or some of the other ones.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. James, I would like to focus on the chart that you had on the 400 master brands, with 50% accounting for 98% of revenue and 50% just 2% of revenue. And I know this is a very big question that you could probably talk about for a long time, but kind of high level, how \u2013 what do you think the right mix is? And how do you get to that right mix? Presumably, there were certain incentives, relationships with the bottlers that got you where you are now. How do you see that evolving over time? And what do you \u2013 how do you think the financial impact will be when you get to a more optimal mix? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I am not sure there is a destination where there's one right number of the mix between leaders, challengers and explorers. And we will always have a tail of smaller brands. That's not the issue that we're after. And actually, it would probably be a sign of weakness to have no smaller brands in the portfolio because it would mean we're not nurturing the future, we're not nurturing the explorers that will be challengers, that will be leaders in the future. What we want to see is a steady pipeline of progression of creating ever-stronger brands that have real quality leadership. Obviously, they've got to pass through the challengers phase. And therefore, you've got to launch a whole series of explorers, small brands, to try and get there, knowing that most of them will not make it. What we're looking at here is that we have not been as assertive enough and directive enough at weeding out the explorers that have not worked and are unlikely to work so that we can redirect the resources on to the explorers and the challengers that have the most opportunity into the future. So it's not a question of a certain number of explorers are right or wrong, it's a question of, are they succeeding or not? And we \u2013 I think we talked at the Investor Day that the success criteria for explorer is very fast growth and starting to gain a core of very engaged and loyal consumers, and that you're really starting to make waves in the category even though small. And that the success criteria for a challenger was being able to gain enough market share that, over time, you could believe you were going to get to leadership. Because at leadership, you have both scale and disproportionately more favorable economics and margin versus the other two categories. So what we're looking at here is, in a way, the result of lots of experimentation and exploration, which is a good thing, but we are looking at an incomplete task of weeding out the ones that work. And so what we're looking at, particularly in a large bucket of smaller brands, is they stayed small for some good period of time, and they're not growing, so they're not meeting the success criteria for saying \u2013 there as an explorer brand. And that's true across all categories. I mean, our objective remains to create a broad portfolio of leaders across all sorts of categories. And so really, we are just accelerating the work that we knew needed to happen on all those explorer brands that were not meeting our own success criteria, if they were going somewhere, they were growing, et cetera. And that will allow us to redirect resources to those that are best positioned to grow. So again, we'll be fueling top line growth more efficiently, allowing us to get back to where we were in 2019 and emerge stronger ahead of the pack with better margins for our system.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nSteve Powers: Yes, hi everyone. Good morning. I guess a question for me on capital allocation. John, you were pretty clear on the priorities and the near-term deemphasis on M&A and share repurchase. But the implication there is that you have high confidence in your ability to both reinvest heavily in the business and also continue to maintain, even grow, the dividend, whereas the market's been increasingly concerned about your ability to do just that in recent weeks and months. So can you maybe expand on what drives your confidence there? And is there any set of circumstances that you can envision in the near to medium term that might better challenge your ability to defend the dividend, again, given the takes in your prioritization?\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Steve. First and foremost, I think the decisions on capital allocation, we take into account not just the short-term, but also taking a view as to where we think the business will be over the next couple of years. And as we look at that, even though, as James said, there are a number of known unknowns, you got \u2013 I think you got to divide the calendar into a few parts. One is what's happening in the here and now, number two is the sort of the length and shape of the recovery and then number three is getting back to some degree of what people are, I think, calling a new normal. So we've got tremendous confidence in the beverage industry in general. We think that the fundamentals for growth going forward longer-term remain the same, albeit with the challenges in the near-term. And we think that we can and we'll get back to the high end of our long-term growth algorithm over time. And so with that context, we're comfortable in maintaining our position around our capital allocation and, first and foremost, continuing to support the business as we go forward in terms of capital and marketing investments; and then number two, continuing to support the dividend in that period. Wrapped around that, of course, is our overall debt strategy. We are confident, with the decisions we've taken year-to-date, that the balance sheet is strong enough to withhold the near-term pressures. And we're \u2013 while we may go slightly outside of our range this year, we see that being a short-term blip. So I'll also say we're confident in the industry, in our ability to emerge stronger. And with that in mind, the priorities that we lay out, we think, are achievable. Obviously, as James just said, there are lots of kind of known unknowns, and we will continue to review and adapt as those unknowns become more known.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nLaurent Grandet: Yes, good morning everyone. James, I'd like to focus my question on the on-premise channel. Can you please unbundle the on-premise performance and trends? So what are you seeing in QSRs versus casual dining, contract caterers or sports/concert venues or travel? Trying to figure out the pace of the recovery by those subchannels. And is it fair to assume that the piece that is recovering the fastest, like QSR, is probably not \u2013 less profitable? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I'll try and add a little bit of texture on this one for you. But the first thing to bear in mind is the predominant effect is the degree of lockdown in the country as it relates to those channels. So there isn't really a way to describe the global trends by those different channels because it very much depended \u2013 or does depend still on what sorts of measures governments have put in place to \u2013 for health reasons. And so there's \u2013 the global trend is not really that meaningful. I would just urge you to look more at the degree of lockdown on the total business. If we take one country and look at what we see as to have happened there, and take the U.S., which is the one you're probably most familiar with. If we look at the away-from-home channels, first point to know is there was sequential improvement as we went from April to May to June. And so things got better. Clearly, the biggest determinant of how our channel did was what percent of its business needed people to be inside the building. So you mentioned QSR. Actually, QSR was one of the, in aggregate in the U.S., was at the better end of the impact. Why? Because many of them have well-developed drive-thru and digitally enabled takeaway businesses. So actually, they not only improved but they were not the most affected of the eating-away channels. The sorts of channels that were most impacted by the lockdowns were bars, full-service restaurants, at-work locations. Some of these places were, simply put, there was no foot traffic. And so the declines were significant. And given that many offices are still not going back to full working, if at all. For example, at-work remains one of the most affected channels, much more so than QSR or other casual dining or even bars and restaurants. So the simplest way to think about or to analyze the away-from-home channels is simply to look at the degree that the restrictions in place at any moment in time and how that affects their business, vis-\u00e0-vis do they have takeaway or business that can leave the location? And to what extent are they dependent fully on people being in the location?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBonnie Herzog: Good morning. I actually had a question on the ramping of your marketing spend in the second half as it sounds like you've started to accelerate spending ahead of the recovery. So I really wanted to understand how quickly you expect the spending to impact the top line, given there's typically a lag. And then I assume there will be a bigger drag on your margins from the stepped-up spending in the second half. But maybe clarify that and then maybe highlight any offsets you might have or levers you can pull to minimize the impact from this? Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Bonnie. Let me take that one. Again, as I mentioned here, I think it's important to kind of divide the calendar up. As you know, for the second quarter, we did take a significant step back from marketing because we didn't think it was going to be that effective. And as we look to the second half of the year, I think the name of the game is to stay flexible and be able to adapt as quickly as possible. With that in mind, as we see the shape of the recovery taking place around the world, there are opportunities to step up, to step back up our investment levels. And I think there's also an opportunity to use this time to completely rethink the amount of investment a market actually needs in an optimal level going forward. So that's very much a key priority for the second half of the year. In terms of specific numbers, I don't have specific numbers to provide because I think it's, again, going back to what I said about being flexible, it's a function of being able to adapt and react as markets demonstrate the trajectory that they're on. But as we go forward and as we go into 2021, a key priority is to emerge stronger, as James alluded to earlier, and to emerge stronger faster. And so with that in mind, it's a key objective in the second half of the year, is to position ourselves well for 2021, and particularly in the markets that are really important to us and the markets where the competitive pressures are strongest. So stepping it up on a case-by-case basis in the second half of the year and being ready for 2021. And for sure, as I said in the script, as we look into the second half of the year, you're not going to potentially see the same cost efficiencies that drove the sort of the operating margin impact in the second quarter in the second half of the year as we continue to look at our marketing needs and take decisions accordingly.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBill Chappell: Hey, thanks. Good morning. James, I just wanted to step back, trying to understand like how we should look at the \u2013 in the slide deck, the announcements today, because, I mean, on one side, you can say, look, we're trying to be more nimble, we're trying to be stronger coming out. The other side, you can say, look, earnings don't matter this year, they might not really matter this year. Let's \u2013 don't waste a good crisis, let's step up all our spending and move forward and we can really accelerate everything over the next year. And if it's the latter, then you didn't really talk about kind of how much this is going to cost and whether it's going to impact this year and next year in terms of costs. So maybe a little more color on which way it is and what you're expecting to spend?\nJames Quincey: I'm not sure whether you are referring as much the DME or any additional costs because we're changing our product. But let me try a couple of things and then see whether it answers the question. I mean, firstly, let me just underline what John said. We are going to be good stewards of our capital. And yes, of course, we could just pile on the marketing spend because \"no one cares about the earnings this year.\" Yes, but that still comes from our bottom line and our capital available. And if you look \u2013 if you ignore calendar years and just think about the business, why would I want to spend money in a period if I can't get the return, particularly if there's a strong lockdown? So we don't take an approach of overly thinking in the calendar years when it comes to marketing. We're about generating momentum for the brands and the business. And as John said, if we see opportunities to invest and generate and accelerate the top line growth, that's what we're going to do, which is the inverse of what we saw in the second quarter. We thought no marketing is going to make much difference in the second quarter, so we pulled back heavily. And then we'll have to gauge and be adaptable as we work through the uncertainty in these known unknowns as to where or which countries and which categories versus which lockdowns is it going to make sense to spend? So we are going to be judicious in our use of marketing, in our use of capital expenditure. We \u2013 much as you can see the sales trend improving through the quarter to July, our expectation is that the general direction of travel is sequential improvement, therefore, we expect to come back and spend more marketing. But we're going to be focused on getting that right.  But said more generally, if we're going to emerge stronger, we need to get the business back to the right level of investment to drive the top line growth. That's what's going to create the profit growth for the Coca-Cola Company. And that is going to go behind the revamped approach to the portfolio, the revamped approach to how we continue to do marketing. If we do have to let go of some brands, potentially even ones we've acquired, like Odwalla, we may need to take some charges. And even though it wouldn't affect the cash flow because we're using it, perhaps we converted the brand to something else or maybe it wasn't making any money, but there might have to be some charges. Obviously, our intent would be to make those decisions as quickly as possible and recognize them as soon as they're made. I hope that provides something of color to your question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. So I'm wondering if you can elaborate more on the efficiency and ROI commentary that you guys just made. If you can see operating margins inflect already in the third quarter year-over-year, or more of a fourth quarter aspiration? And a clarification on John's comments about capital allocation. Is there any room to accelerate the divestitures of the Bottling Investments that you've done so far and become even more asset-light to repurpose the funds into dividends and buybacks? Thank you.\nJohn Murphy: So on \u2013 thanks, Andrea. On the second question, there's \u2013 as we've in previous calls, I think we have a very open book with respect to the balance sheet and rightsizing and optimizing the balance sheet as we go forward. And there's no investment on the balance sheet that does not get a regular review and determination as to whether it should still be there. With respect to that part of the decision-making, our Bottling Investments group is an important piece of the equation. We don't have a timetable for further refranchising, but it certainly is our longer-term goal to be more asset-light, just as we have, I think, stated on previous occasions, and have acted accordingly with previous refranchising efforts. So that will and continues to be a part of the agenda, but not a specific time line on it. And then with respect to the comment on operating margins, I don't have a clear number to give you for either Q3 or Q4. But it goes without saying, is that as we looked at the opportunities that present themselves, we're not necessarily as focused on the months, but we're more focused on building momentum for the business and sustaining it in the \u2013 particularly in the markets that have got outsized importance to us. So we'll make those decisions as they come and as they appear to be the right ones to make at the right time, and the consequences will flow through accordingly.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlos Laboy with HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nCarlos Laboy: Yes. Good morning, everyone. You note big sparkling declines in India, Western Europe and fountain in the U.S. Have deep structural changes, such as heavy client turnover, in any of those three situations prompted you to move toward a reset of the model in those three businesses?\nJames Quincey: Carlos, no, I don't think I would describe any of those as a deep structural change that has driven some sort of reset of the model. Again, they're very, very linked to the degree of lockdown that has been mandated because of COVID. And if you just take those three \u2013 both, I mean, fountain or food service and on-premise in the U.S. and a lot of EMEA, particularly the Western Europe, has a lot of away-from-home business, the outlets were shut. And what we found is that as the outlets start to open, the business starts to flourish again. And India, simply put, there isn't a modern trade as you'd understand it in the developed markets at a large scale. And so when they had a lockdown, it locked down all the small stores. And so literally, the whole marketplace was closed down at that point in time in what would have been a peak season in India. So it's really lockdown-related. And I think as they come off, you'll see the reopenings. We are social creatures, as humans, and we like experiences. People will want to go out. There will be habits that will have changed, but we will go out and experience the world, and these channels will bounce back. John?\nJohn Murphy: Yes, James, just \u2013 if I could just add to that. I think, Carlos, I think what we will see, both in some of the developing markets like India and even here in the United States, is I think there will be a higher turnover, particularly of small customers, in both the sort of more modern away-from-home as well as the traditional away from home. So I think we expect to see that. But that in and of itself, I don't think means a structural reset is necessary. It could just mean there will be more new ones coming along. And for our system, it just \u2013 it will be a key area of focus as we come out of the recovery period.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nKevin Grundy: Hey. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for taking the question. I wanted to come back to investment levels. It was talked about with a couple of different prior questions, but ask it differently and really focus on North America. And my question isn't so much about cadence, but really more about adequacy. And the context being that your key competitor has committed to supporting its brands, this is on the heels of stepped-up investment levels last year. They're now trying to hit an external earnings number, and market share is an increasing focus. If I'm not mistaken, it's also a bigger part of executive comp. And then of course, the snack side of the business is thriving, which gives them some flexibility to lean in on beverages. So setting aside the COVID-related pressures, can you comment on what you're seeing competitively in North America? I think you commented a moment ago that there's also willingness internally at the Coca-Cola Company to forgo any sort of profit targets to lean in and make sure that you're adequately reinvested in key markets, presumably the U.S. would be included in that. Maybe you just can confirm it. And then maybe talk a little bit about some of the governors and key metrics that you guys are looking at: Brand equity, market share, absolute levels of A&M spending, to ensure that your brands are indeed adequately supported and that you don't end up vetted into year-end, and looking out to next year, falling short if you're underinvested? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Do you want a go, John? So I'll go ahead. I'll start, then maybe you can jump in. Clearly, we are go \u2013 I mean, we've set a North Star: Emerge stronger, which is gain more \u2013 engage with more consumers, gain more drinkers, gain share and reestablish system economics for us and the bottling system. So that is where we're headed. And very clearly, that we're going \u2013 if we have to choose between investing and not investing in making more money, but damaging the top line, we're going to invest to drive the top line.  The fundamentals of the Coke system work when we can get back where we were precrisis, which was the top end of the growth algorithm on the top line, and that then flows through with the leverage into the bottom line. So that is going to be the North Star globally. And in North America, we need to make sure that happens. And clearly, we're going to do that in a flexible way that John talked about the DME. Having said that, we fully expect to be spending sequentially more DME in North America in Q3 and into Q4. Obviously, we have key metrics by brand as to what we expect from each brand and what they're doing and going for that. And what we see in the marketplace is, again, a bit like the total volume performance. In terms of share, what we see is that where the world is open, we've been able to gain share. The predominant negative effect is channel mix. And it's worth remembering that our \u2013 we have half as much a gain market share in away-from-home channels as we have in at-home channels. So the closing of the away-from-home, of course, makes a negative impact to our market share. So what we've done \u2013 what we're focusing on is in the channels that are open, let's focus on gaining share where the world is still working, knowing that as the reopenings occur, and being social humans, we'll go out for the experiences, that we will structurally have gained share in channels and then we'll be favored as those where we have historically been stronger start their reopening. So that's our approach overall and in North America.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.\nJames Quincey: Thank you, everyone. So to sum up, we're using the current moment of the pandemic as an opportunity to accelerate the implementation of our strategies. With a portfolio of strong brands, a focus on high-impact marketing innovation and a structure that fits the strategy, we are confident that our system will emerge stronger from this crisis and return to delivering good growth for the years to come. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us today. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. All participants will be on listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors and, therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations Department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Leveridge, Vice President and Investor Relations Officer. Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.\nTim Leveridge: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and John Murphy, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that we posted schedules under the financial reports and information tab in the Investors section of our company website at www.coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. I would also like to note that you can find additional materials in the Investors section of our company website that provide an analysis of our margin structure. In addition, this conference call may contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements, contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over to your questions. We recognize there will be a good deal of questions. [Operator Instructions] Now, let me turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Tim and good morning everyone. I'll start by noting that we're operating in truly extraordinary times, times of great challenges, but also times in which we can see many key opportunities ahead. First and foremost, on behalf of our company and our entire system, I'd like to share our deepest sympathies for all those who have been affected by this global pandemic. We also sincerely thank those who've been working to keep all of us safe through the crisis, particularly those on the front lines in the health care community. I also want to recognize our system associates, who are ensuring we can continue to supply beverages all around the world. We're still in the most intense first phase of the crisis in many places, if not most of the world. Through it all, we remain grounded in our purpose to refresh the world and make a difference. We start with employee health and safety which is paramount, followed by business continuity and our support of communities around the world. The vast majority of our office-based employees are working remotely. For those associates in our manufacturing and distribution facilities, we're using enhanced hygiene and sanitation practices. Through these practices, we are ensuring, our system associates are well and our products are safe and that they're delivered safely to our customers and consumers. We're closely linked with our bottlers on business continuity, which includes contingency planning for our global supply chain. And thanks to this hard work -- efforts across the whole system we don't foresee any material disruptions at this time. It's important to note that our business has a long heritage of supporting communities in times of need. The Coca-Cola system has made significant commitments to support relief efforts in markets impacted across the globe. Our system is committed to contributing more than $100 million and is focused on community relief programs, medical supplies and equipment during the outbreak phase, as well as on developing other actions for the recovery phase in markets hit hardest by the pandemic. Those commitments to date include the $40 million charitable grant from the Coca-Cola Foundation. We are working collaboratively with governments at all levels, federal, state and local to help steer the nation and the world towards recovery. We are all confident that we can with the communities we proudly call home rebound if we all work together for a better future. Now, as we look to the future, we recognize these are truly unprecedented times. And for that reason, we will take a different approach to our guidance and our discussion today. Recognizing that the operating backdrop has changed rapidly in the last several weeks, we will spend limited time discussing our first quarter results. In addition, given the great uncertainty in the current environment, we feel it's prudent to hold off providing fiscal year 2020 guidance. We expect to come back in our second quarter call in July with greater clarity. Today, I'd like to share, one, what we've been learning and observing as the situation evolves. Second, the actions we're taking now both to adapt to the current environment and to best position ourselves for the future. Third, and finally what gives me confidence that we will emerge even stronger. And lastly, I'll turn it over to John to discuss our financial strategy. The first quarter began with good momentum coming off strong results in 2019. We were successfully executing our long-term strategy. Through February, we had solid broad-based strength across the globe with the exception of China, where the progression of the virus was already well ahead of the rest of the world. Looking at it excluding China, our business was growing volumes 3% and we were continuing to gain value share. But as shelter at home and social distancing practice increased rapidly and globally, there has been temporary but profound pressure on our customers and our business. The biggest impact has been a sharp decline in the important away-from-home portion of our business, which includes our eating and drinking channels as well as our on-the-go orientated channels like convenience retail. While our exposure varies across markets, away-from-home broadly represents about half of our business given our strong share positions. In some markets like the U.S., drive-thru operations and carryout have helped offset some of the pressure, but most restaurants are operating on limited hours and are seeing overall trips decline sharply. In the at-home channels, we've seen some early pantry loading particularly in certain developed markets at the beginning of many of the lockdown phases. Then, as we get past the initial phases of the lockdown however, we are seeing levels normalize. In other markets like India, for example, the severity of the distancing measures has negatively impacted at-home as well, simply due to the significant reduction in shopping trips. At this stage, it's a little too early to determine exactly what level at-home trends will stabilize at. We've also seen a significant increase in e-commerce channels where we have been accelerating our presence versus the pre crisis. However, given the net effect of these shifts we expect a temporary but significant impact on our business in the second quarter primarily coming from the slowdown in our away from home business. For context, if we look at our April month-to-date trends we are seeing volumes down globally approximately 25% driven by the sharp declines in our away from home businesses. Fortunately based on the latest projections, we do expect the second quarter to be the most severely impacted. With that said, there is still a good deal of uncertainty around the trajectory of the pandemic as well as the resulting macroeconomic impact. While we're seeing different impacts across geographies and at different times, generally we expect three phases. The outright with its corresponding social distancing measures, a period of graduated re-openings; and finally a return to a new normal. Consumer mindset and shopping behavior will be different in each phase and they'll vary across markets, but we foresee some similar patterns that I'll discuss in greater detail. Of course, we can look to China for some early learnings about the various phases. I'm happy to say that our plants there are all operating and employees have returned to company offices in Shanghai. We're seeing encouraging signs of increased consumption as outlets reopen resulting in sequential improvement in China. However, the consumption is still lower than prior year and we expect the full recovery to take time especially as there are still limits on crowd sizes. As we anticipate a recovery in China, we're planning key actions with bottlers to regain momentum including our pre summer sales promotion and increased cooler placement. We will follow the strategy that has proved successful before the pandemic adjusted with greater focus on channels and packages that will have traction as the new normal unfolds. While we're encouraged by the improving trends in China, we recognize other countries may not follow the same trajectory and changes in social distancing practices may be gradual. And the situation in China could certainly continue to evolve. It is simply too soon to estimate exactly what might lay head. That's why we're taking swift action now to adapt in the near-term while best positioning ourselves for success later. Our global workforce is a critical asset and protecting people and roles is a high priority. Teams around the world are being asked to work differently and they're rising to the occasion. We have implemented real-time network collaboration routines to accelerate knowledge sharing. We're adapting local market strategies across our system including supply chain, stakeholder engagement and workforce management. We've adopted dynamic resource allocation practices in many regions matching people to projects and scaling the best ideas across geographies. In many ways the strategy we laid out at CAGNY remains the same, centered around brand building innovation, revenue growth management and execution. Having the ability to dial up and recalibrate aspects of that strategy is critical in this environment. A culture of agility is key. We are working seamlessly with our bottlers and retail customers to meet real-time demand given the rapid shifts in customer patterns. Bottler alignment has never been more important and the work we've done to strengthen the system in recent years is bearing fruit in step-up execution. For our retail customers, grocery stores for example, we're focused on maximizing system efficiency by ruthlessly prioritizing to deliver on core SKUs and key brands and help customers simplify their supply chains. We're also taking this opportunity to reshape our innovation pipeline to eliminate a longer tail of smaller projects and allocate resources to fewer, larger, more scalable and more relevant solutions for this environment. With shoppers spending less time browsing, it's crucial that we work to minimize out of stocks and maximize share of visible inventory. In markets around the world, we've redeployed on the ground sales reps and especially those orientated towards the on-premise trade and refocus them on merchandising, resulting in increased share of displays of stock on the floor. As consumers adjust to stay at home lifestyle, they're making fewer shopping trips and filling bigger baskets often based on availability and orientate to known trusted brands. Therefore, we are working with our customers to maximize promotional effectiveness and reconsidering multipack promotions and frequency to ensure the mix of our product and packaging offerings are meeting their needs. Our consumer centric total beverage strategy has enabled us to deliver products that shoppers want when stocking up on essentials whether it's to refresh, hydrate or provide functional benefits. We also recognize the importance of customers both big and small and are working to support independent retailers. We're implementing measures to support small retailers in many countries. For example in Brazil mom-and-pop stores face mounting pressure and they are a key pillar not only of our business but local communities. We have played a leading role in the formation of the Small Trade Activity Recovery or STAR program. Along with consumer product peers, the STAR coalition will connect companies, government and small retail associations to help small and medium retailers. We've also experienced an upsurge in e-commerce across the globe with the growth rate of the channel doubling in many countries. Consumers are getting necessities delivered to their door in many cases with contactless delivery. Revenue growth management plays a key role in our current strategy as we shift towards package sizes that are fit for purpose online sales and as we reallocate consumer and trade promotions to digital. For grocery e-delivery companies, we've increased in-app visibility with a focus on multi packs, so consumers can access our beverage within a click's reach of desire. We are also acting fast to address the needs of restaurant partners as they adapt to the current environment. In North America, we've offered our foodservice restaurant partners an alternative to fountain drink by ensuring bottle can availability for delivery. In the U.S. we partnered with the national leading food aggregators to increase our product profile and accelerate customer menu optimization by included beverage options and value bundles. Also, we've recently played an active role in The Great American Takeout movement with the National Restaurant Association. We're also being mindful about the right level of brand marketing and new product launches given the consumer mindset across markets. We've developed and determined that in this initial phase there is limited effectiveness to broad-based brand marketing. With this in mind, we've reduced our direct consumer communication we'll pause sizable marketing campaigns through the early stages of the crisis and reengage when the timing is right. These plans will vary from market to market with our earliest reengagement focusing on the recovery in China. At the same time, we are leveraging our associates to address longer-term opportunities recognizing that near-term realities will subside. Looking ahead, we may not know the exact shape of the recovery but we are taking action today to be prepared for the future. For the recovery phase RGM is key as we prepare to strike the right balance of affordability and recruitment packs in addition to premium offerings. This is one area where we are much better positioned versus our system 10 years ago when our portfolio and SKU optionality was not nearly as sophisticated as it is today. We'll also embrace some seismic consumer behavior shifts that are taking place, especially in e-commerce. We believe the accelerating expansion of the channel is sustainable and we want to continue to be well positioned for long-term growth. We are investing in digital capabilities to strengthen consumer connections and further piloting several different digital-enabled initiatives using fulfillment methods, whether B2B to home or B2C platforms in many countries to capture online demand for at-home consumption in the future. We're seeing good results in these early days and are looking to scale similar partnerships with more customers. In times when a crisis hit it can be easy to lose sight of the long-term but we will continue to build a more sustainable business for the future. Late last year, we refreshed our purpose statement: to refresh the world and make a difference and our company's purpose is now more important than ever. Tomorrow the company will publish its 2019 Business and Sustainability Report, reflecting a continued journey towards driving a more sustainable business. While there are still many unknowns ahead, we do know that over 134 years of business we've seen many types of crises, be they military, economic or pandemic and the Coca-Cola Company has always emerged stronger in the end. We are in a better position today than we were heading into previous periods of challenge. We've made meaningful progress in accelerating our capabilities, reshaping our bottling system, pivoting our portfolio and transforming our culture. Undoubtedly, there will be ups and downs in the coming months. But with our bottling partners, we are clear on what needs to be done both now and into the future to manage our business, focus our strategies, accelerate our actions and redirect our investments. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and thanks to all of you for joining us. I'd like to complement James' remarks with a particular focus on the following areas: our people, 2020 profitability and cash flow, capital allocation priorities, our bottling system and our post-COVID readiness. It maybe a little unusual to start the finance review on people, but in these times it is absolutely the right place to start. The manner in which we have seen sacrifice, commitment, resilience and adaptability in the past weeks has stood out, and we have been able to accomplish things which in normal times would have seemed impossible. As with many companies, job security is a concern for our people. And for us, it has been a key priority as we navigate through this period. Where necessary we have furloughed some employees and we have done so on full pay through June. The length, severity and overall impact of the crisis will ultimately determine how we will come out of this and we will be very thoughtful on our approach. What we do see as James mentioned is a lot of redeployment enabling the company to pivot quickly with the work that matters most in these times. The agility we are seeing across the world in this regard has been impressive and is opening the door to new ways of working that are allowing us to be a lot more responsive. For me some of the work that matters most is smart use of the many levers we have at our disposal to maximize profit and cash flow. On the revenue side, we have made substantial changes to our brand pack portfolio focus and are leveraging the playbooks on affordability and value that have served us so well in past crisis around the world. On the expenditure side, I would divide it into four key focus areas and with a particular emphasis on quarter 2. One, as James mentioned, we have been pulling back on our marketing spend for now. Staying close to our consumers in a relevant way is a key guiding principle, and staying disciplined to demand an appropriate ROI is a close second. Two, we are taking a similar approach with our trade dollars. While much of that spend is managed by our bottlers in both our bottling investments and North America businesses this is an important area to effectively manage and be willing to reengineer. Three, we are attacking all discretionary operating expenses and challenging what is essential and making sure every dollar being spent on services, travel, meetings, et cetera is appropriate. And four, we have paused all capital spend other than what is absolutely essential or has already been committed. By moving quickly and decisively we will avoid waste, improve ROI and spend and give us maximum flexibility for the second half of the year as we gain clarity on the outlook. Finally as a quick reminder for your models, the reductions to marketing and trade spend will get phased over the balance of the year. Our capital allocation priorities should be framed against our liquidity position and our balance sheet. With the actions taken since March, our overall liquidity is strong and so to is our balance sheet. We will of course continue to focus on protecting the progress we made on working capital and free cash flow in 2019. And in this context, our capital allocation priorities remain very much focused on investing wisely to support our business operations and continuing to prioritize our dividend. Specifically with regard to the dividend, we currently have no intentions to change our approach. Regarding M&A, we do not foresee any significant activity going forward this year, nor do we intend to repurchase shares. We are also mindful of staying close to the debt range we have previously highlighted. We will of course review our overall approach to capital allocation as we know more about the length and severity of the crisis. James spoke earlier about how our global bottling system is adapting to the coronavirus pandemic. I cannot overstate the admiration we all have for everything our bottling partners are doing to stay close to their people, their customers and their communities. Many of them are battle heartened when it comes to managing crisis and I know they are proactively taking steps to preserve cash, strengthen their balance sheets and manage their P&Ls. Currently we do not have any major concerns surrounding our bottling partners from a liquidity perspective and we are working closely with them to anticipate and deal effectively with a scenario where the coronavirus situation is longer and more severe than currently anticipated. As we noted in our release, we are unable to provide an update to our full year 2020 financial outlook. We expect to have a better picture of how the recovery will unfold when we report our second quarter results in July. Meantime, I would like to highlight the following. In looking at currency impacts for comparable net revenues based on current spot rates and including the impact of hedge positions, we expect a mid-single-digit full year headwind. For comparable operating income also based on current spot rates, expect a high single-digit headwind with most of the headwind coming from our developing and emerging markets. We still expect the company's underlying effective tax rate to be 19.5% for the year. Looking ahead it's important that we adapt quickly to the current environment while also best positioning ourselves to win in the post-COVID world. Emerging stronger from this crisis, demands a willingness to challenge the status quo. To that end we are using this time to do just that. The last couple of months have already taught us how to do many things very differently. In closing, let me say, I have never been more proud to be part of the Coca-Cola system are indeed more optimistic. It's a testament to the culture of transformation taking hold across the organization. Our people and the strategic alignment of our system gives me the confidence in our ability to not only manage through the current crisis but to emerge from it stronger. With that operator we are ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nSteve Powers: Thanks. Hi, guys. Good morning. I hope you're all well and thanks for all that detail. I guess building on where you focused your prepared remarks James, I think everyone on the call is likely trying to tease out to some extent the depth and duration of what hopefully is a bottom in 2Q and then how the system is likely to emerge on the back side. When you think about what you and your bottling partners have seen thus far in China but also Italy, elsewhere in Europe and the U.S., are there common experiences whether positive or negative that you can pass along that can help us better get underneath that question? And how are you handicapping the forward prospects in key emerging markets like Brazil or India, where arguably the implications are just now taking shape? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Let me offer a few thoughts and see whether that helps. Firstly, there's a set of in the famous expression known unknowns here that heavily influence the shape of how long this \u2013 the virus crisis will last and the resulting economic crisis and the degree of ups and downs and volatile on the way. And those known unknowns are all out there and we can't determine which way they're going to take us. And I think that's important because while there are some learnings from the earlier markets like China, South Korea or even some of the European markets, we're still at the beginning. We're still at the beginning. What do I mean by that? We can see the path of how China or South Korea or Singapore, some of those countries came into the crisis, how the lockdowns occurred by channel, by pack, by brand, the change in consumer behavior; and then being able to follow that journey as they have opened up and the thing has started to stabilize. And you can see China, we were doing great in January. We had a fantastic start to the year double-digit growth. It was a very profound lockdown in February, much deeper than the minus 25% we're currently seeing globally and we started to build back up volatile from week-to-week in March. And we're kind of getting close towards neutral in China now, still below where we were last year and where we were in January. But I think it's important to emphasize that doesn't mean it's over. We can see from Singapore or Tokyo Japan they have a kind of a second wave of the lockdown. So what we see is very clear experiences on what happens in the first phase of the lockdown pantry load channel changes et cetera, et cetera. And we've done a great job of moving those, link around the world. Now we expect to see the next phase of the crisis come which is post generalized global lockdowns. We're going to see a graduated set of re-openings around the world. How long they will take to get from where we are now to the new normal depends on these known unknowns, and could include further retreats to lockdowns as we've seen in a couple of countries. So we can't -- known unknown. What we can do is focus on what we're good at. We can focus on a few simple ideas. One the beverage industry is a great industry. As I said on the call, every previous crisis military economic or pandemic in that last 134 years, the Coke Company has come out stronger. We've done that by doing essentially two things at the same time. One, using the DNA of our system which knows how to manage in an economic crisis resulting from whatever, manage the business on a day-to-day, week-to-week, quarter-to-quarter basis, having the flexibility and adaptability to do the right amount of brand building innovation, revenue growth manage our next Houston market. But at the same time, have an eye on where is this going in the long-term such that, as we work our way through the winding path of what the crisis takes us, we end up emerging stronger. And so I would emphasize. And that's obviously why we haven't provided full year guidance. We are still at the beginning. We may be at the end of the big global lockdown, but we are still some way from the new normal.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nBryan Spillane: Hey. Good morning, everybody. So I guess, just thinking about the comments James that you made about maybe changes in packaging. And maybe linking that to as we get past this initial lockdown phase and thinking about the business, maybe a year out. What is the sort of dynamic that you're sort of trying to focus on? Is it one a recession and a consumer maybe more focused on value, or is it the second being more the consumer-focused changes in consumer behavior patterns? Maybe consumers buying more e-commerce more reluctant to have that away-from-home consumption just trying to understand how you're kind of thinking about how the business changes once we get past that lockdown phase? And again does it imply maybe a greater shift to the at-home packaging versus away-from-home?\nJames Quincey: Yeah, great question. Look, you could clearly see a set of clear trends on the packaging. I mean in the lockdown, obviously the away-from-home channels are down heavily which means the immediate consumption packaging are down heavily. And we're much more focused on at-home which tends to be larger or multi packs. But it also sees a big step-up in e-commerce. We've seen a near doubling of our -- of the importance of the growth of e-commerce for us. So once we get past the lockdown I think, we'll see an environment through these graduated re-openings of society still with the spectre of the virus over us with a reality of an impacted economy. And I think what we'd like to see is a step change in some already ongoing trends like a step-up in e-commerce. It is both economically attractive and kind of spectre of the virus friendly, so I think we'll see a lot more e-commerce. I think it will take time for the highest aggregation channels to come back. But I think they will come back in the end. In the new normal there will be new consumer behavior at that point in time, because ultimately we are social animals. That aggregation will come back. But I think, we're also going to see a very profound theme of affordability. What we're seeing in the lockdown is not just the effect of the lockdown of certain channels. But I think that anticipation by the consumer of where the economy is going. There's going to be an economic impact. We're in the face of all this uncertainty. So we're going to see a lot more -- a lot more affordability where we've launched refillable PET back again in South Africa. We're investing in refillables in Latin America. We're really looking at how we can drive affordability for them. So a lot more e-commerce in the future, we're certainly going to see a profound theme of affordability coming up in the next years. We're going to see a lot of attempts by governments by us as well to support the smaller outlet base, as those will be the ones who've most suffered in the lockdown, whatever channel they're in. So we have been able to pivot and we expect to continue to pivot our brand marketing our innovation our revenue growth management and the execution by the bottlers through each stage of this crisis as it moves forward. In the end, the crisis management DNA is out there in the system. We may not have faced a global pandemic in living memory. But all around the world in the system we have lots of managers who've been in countries which have faced crisis. And as the spectre of the virus lifts what we'll be left with is an impacted economy -- some new consumer behaviors but an impacted economy. And this is when the Coke system can shine and always has shone in the past.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC. Your line is now open.\nNik Modi: Yeah. Thanks good morning everyone. James you talked about really focusing on the core some core SKUs in order to have it in stock obviously with the demand surge. But can you talk a little bit about, how your interaction with the retail community has been in terms of how they're thinking about some of the longer-lasting impacts of the decisions they make in terms of how many products they shelve and the kind of assortment they carry, any perspective around that? I know it's early but I'm already starting to hear some of this coming back in the retail community, in terms of how they're thinking about streamlining their assortment and portfolio choices, so just curious, if you've been hearing the same?\nJames Quincey: Yes absolutely. And two things come together in the short term and they both work in the same direction which is the crisis management of keeping the supply chain open, while we have all these restrictions in the period of the lockdown and the virus crisis. And then I think you've got this likelihood of an impacted economy going forward for some period of time. In both those circumstances, both of those things lead you to a similar set of actions whether you're a manufacturer or an at-home retailer which is to focus on the biggest most important most well-known brands and affordability and making sure you can get availability in store. I mean one of the -- one of -- we've had a lot of focus on supporting the grocery customers. Because of course, we've got a strong bottling system that can deliver reliable supply onto the floor. So we've seen ourselves be able to gain share of inventory in the store because we've been able to sustain the supply chain. So really being able to be there for the customers and execute and deliver product on the floor. But both us and them will also be driving to a rationalization on focusing on what's the most effective set of brands and SKUs to push through which will mean a cutting of the longer tail in this coming period. Will more choice, more innovation come back when new normal and economy reestablishes itself? Yes, I'm sure it will. But in this period it's going to be a question of focus.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey guys, I hope you all are well. James I just want to press a bit more on Steve's question and I know it's hard to answer it. But if one sort of makes the assumption that government-mandated closures and the social distancing all by the end of Q2 doesn't reemerge this disease in a major way this summer, could you just give us some thoughts on the pace of recovery you're expecting on your business as you look out over the next few quarters? And I'm trying to sort of separate out the direct social distancing impact more from the secondary economic impact as we look going forward. Is it more of a V-shaped recovery in your mind for your business or U-shaped or even L-shaped as we look through year-end 2020? And then just taking a step back thinking about 2021, obviously you're not giving expectations any time soon. But again assuming the social distancing doesn't reemerge in a big way in the winter, how confident are you that whatever the volume degradation ends up being in 2020 is, is mostly recovered in 2021? Is it most of it? Is it -- hard to imagine a lot of that comes back? Just conceptually how do you think about these things longer term? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I would love to be able to tell you there's an answer to that question, but there isn't. What we do know is, what is -- we can see the shape of the social distancing measures into the coming months and there are already governments that have distancing measures into Q3. We're very focused as ever on picking up on the re-openings. Those re-openings if we take Europe and the U.S. in May and June, there are people in government that are talking about three phases and they're talking about the reopening part of Phase 1, not yet 2 and 3 are happening in the same quarter. So I think we will see social distancing measures for some period of time into Q3. Hopefully they will not be as severe as the second quarter. Maybe they will last to the fourth maybe not. We just cannot know. What -- we have to focus on is, in a way to use your -- this alphabet soup of scenarios the U the V and L. We have to be ready in case, it's a V. If it does bounce back, we don't want to be so conservative we are not ready for a spring back of the economy and a spring back in demand and we want to be ahead of the curve. I don't think it's -- I have said before I don't think the V is the most likely scenario, but we will be ready if it occurs. The U, clearly you want to take the middle scenario we understand. And certainly, I think the U is more likely than the V and how that's going to go forward. And clearly we need to prepare to act on that one with a lot of the measures we took up. Is the L possible? Yes the L is possible too. Our approach is to make sure we are both flexible and ready and have the plans charged and ready to go when the spring back comes. We also need to manage the recessionary period and the lockdown periods and social distancing periods with specific and tailored plans to do the best we can in those things. And of course we need to be prepared and understand that if it is the L or anything along those lines, we need to have given ourselves some flexibility to respond to those scenarios as well. So the key that we are focused on is, how we anticipate the scenarios that could be ahead of us, across the whole range how do we give ourselves the flexibility to act on them and make sure we manage the business day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter to get the best possible result as we go along this winding path; because we cannot see over the horizon and yet retain a focus that by the end of this crisis the Coca-Cola Company will have emerged stronger and be better setup for the long term as it has always done in every previous crises for its 134 years.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nBonnie Herzog: Hi, thank you. Good morning everyone. I am -- was hoping you could give us a little more color on what you're doing to ensure your supply chain, really is accommodating some of the demand volatility that we've seen in recent weeks. And how is this different in the U.S. versus across some of your emerging markets for instance? And then along those same lines, you probably have a lot of excess capacity at this point for servicing restaurants and in your fountain business. So curious how you manage that side of your supply chain given there's probably a lot of excess capacity there? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. We're clearly very focused on adapting the supply chain. And if I break it down into a few pieces, there's of course sourcing the ingredients that we use in the concentrate in the bottling plant, our own concentrate manufacturing or fountain manufacturing the bottling plants and then on through the distribution. There's been a lot of challenges. But I would like to congratulate the supply chain teams at the company and at all of the bottling partners for the incredible work they've done at basically keeping everything running. I was certainly on record a few weeks ago saying, the supply chains around the world will be creaking. There's been a lot of pressure at the borders, whether it's the provincial \u2013 province-to-province borders in some countries or country-to-country borders in other parts of the world moving some of the ingredients that are basically shipped around the world. But once they're within the country, which is the larger of these, the great advantage of the Coke system is that the Cokes are made locally. All our drinks are basically made locally. The drinks in the U.S. are made in the U.S., the drinks in Germany are made in Germany, the drinks in Kenya are made in Kenya. And so the local supply chain is then able to work designated as part of the food system, so an essential service to allow to run the production systems and distribution. So, we've had relatively \u2013 we've had some issues on timing of ingredients. Those are much better than they were a few weeks ago. Production facilities are largely running. We made a lot of adaptations to ensure safety and sanitation and security for the employees and that's true over the concentrate plants and most of the bottling plants just a couple of places that we see some plant shutdown. And then distribution, we've largely kept up and running everywhere and doubled down on that. Yes. There are issues in the odd countries here and there on the \u2013 on availability of \u2013 in some of the logistics for drivers or having to swap drivers at borders. But generally speaking, it's been \u2013 we've been able to adapt and it's the great strength of having ultimately a local supply chain in each country. And yeah, there are some parts of the supply chain that are running 24/7 and there are some places \u2013 parts like the fountain supply that are much more low utilization. And we'll have to manage through that as we see how these graduated re-openings start to take place in the coming months and quarters.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi. Good morning, everybody. John, if you could just maybe link two things you talked about. You mentioned comfort in your liquidity in the various areas of liquidity you have available as well as the \u2013 a small conversation about the bottlers and such. But can you link them in some way that, if we do end up in an environment, where some of the bottlers need some assistance do you feel like you have the liquidity to either buy them in again or perhaps bail out, or will something like that need to be reliant on consolidation within the bottlers?\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Kau. Let me frame the liquidity position that we have and indeed some of our bottlers first. We've \u2013 as I mentioned, we've taken quick actions in March to anticipate whatever outcome in the back half of the year good bad or indifferent. Keep in mind that, with our bottlers over 50% of our business globally is in the hands of our large public play on bottlers, all of whom came into 2020 with strong balance sheets. And I believe we're doing a very good job also to anticipate a number of different outcomes for the year. We are staying very close to all of our bottlers around the world, small, medium and large. And that will be on a case-by-case basis as to what eventually happens in the coming months, but we feel that we have \u2013 we have plenty of gunpowder available to manage whatever situation evolves in that period. So all in all, we're confident in the overall strength of the system to withstand the coming months.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping \u2013 you talked a lot about sort of the various actions that you're taking on equity expenses and so on and ability to protect profitability from that perspective. But when you're also thinking about gross margins, I was hoping you could just try to weave together all the different things you've talked about trimming this fiscal tail, I guess the smaller innovation efforts, affordability pack efforts, and impact on right now just with the shortfall in immediate consumption; the relative profitability of fountain foodservice. Just \u2013 I think it's \u2013 because for me anyways there certainly no one that likes talking about the quarter, but gross margins were quite strong in the quarter. And so I'm just trying to think forward as we weave together all these different elements how we should think about gross margin as we work through these times? Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: Yeah. So for the quarter gross margins were positively impacted with the mix of the inventory build and a relatively poor performance from our lower-margin segments. With respect to the outlook what I would focus on a couple of points that James also made is that the system is using a number of playbooks. If you think about where revenue growth management started in the world -- in our world, it was really born in Argentina and Latin America during the crisis of the early 2000s. And we're leveraging many of the lessons and indeed the capabilities to focus on our core sparkling brands, which, as you know, have a more favorable margin, to be very clear on the price pack architectures to be able to get full benefit from both an affordability play, but as well as to be able to segment in our channels and markets with the appropriate packs for value. And also during this period, it's been an opportunity to trim back significantly the long tail, which as we've highlighted in previous calls that tail is typically comprised of some of the more \u2013 the younger explorer and challenger brands, which by nature are lower margins. So I think a combination of the playbooks that we know work, a focus on the bigger brands and the key packages that typically are higher margin and being in the position to prioritize our leader brands and packages gives us comfort that the -- on the gross margin front that we can continue to build on the momentum that we've had for the last couple of years.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open.\nBill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning. Just more specifically, maybe you can talk a little bit about kind of the -- sorry about that.\nJames Quincey: Bill, yes, we lost you. We can hear you now.\nBill Chappell: Can you hear me now?\nJames Quincey: Yes, yes.\nBill Chappell: Sorry about that. Good morning. I just wanted to talk a little bit more about the sports event business and kind of how you plan for that over the next couple of quarters? And when I say that, everything from the Olympics to football to what have you, it seems like there's a longer time frame before we have those type of group events. And so, I guess, trying to understand how movable some of your expenditures are in terms of can you quickly cancel those and move them around? And also, how do you plan for not having those type of events to supply for probably six months plus?\nJames Quincey: Yes. Certainly, the expectation when you look at the \u2013 to the extent that there are public reopening plans and talk about what the phases would look like, most sporting events sit in phase three, i.e., towards the back end. So, I think, that it's pretty clear that we're going to see a relatively limited, not say none, amount of large sporting events with audiences in the next couple of quarters, but it's not likely. Hopefully, it will come to pass, but I think it's going to be difficult. Now, how we adapt to that? And, obviously, the biggest one of that is the Olympics, which has now been pushed out to next year. Obviously, there's some degree of fixed investment in the asset in the sponsorship. And, obviously, we're talking to all our partners about how this disruption of the virus impact the assets and what we can do together. The majority of the spend is largely in the activation of the marketing programs with the asset and those tend to be variable cost media buys, one sort or another or a marketing activation, where we can actually repurpose that money to other things. So, as John talked about on the call, we have been very assertive in increasing the degree of flexibility and reprioritization of all the marketing and OpEx. But all the marketing spend in the downhill of the year to maximize flexibility, because we just know which channels or events are going to open up when and potentially change from one day to the next. And so, we're maximizing flexibility. The good news is most of the marketing spend, the large majority of the marketing spend is variable and we retain the opportunity to change our plans as we go through the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about as, kind of, moving into the post-COVID environment, how you feel you're situated for the affordability issue, given changes in your price pack architecture that you've done over the last 10-or-so years? And also, what changes you've done in your culture, right? I mean one of the big things that you've tried to do from the beginning of the first days is make some significant changes in the culture of the Coca-Cola Company. Perhaps you can add to what are you doing along those lines either to push that forward and to meet the challenges and accountability and the speed that you're looking for given the crisis environment? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. We commented a little earlier that responding in a crisis has certainly been part of the DNA of the Coke system. From a cultural point of view, we have been clearly focused in the last few years on -- through some of the organizational changes, through some of the work on training skill building and developing the culture to increase the degree of agility, the nimbleness of the global organization. But also the degree of networking has become a much more networked organization which obviously the two things work together, which has been fantastic in a way because there's no better time to have got better at those two things than when you've got a global crisis. And the value of the learnings that can be moved around the world is certainly very high. So we've been focusing on a number of things the culture, but certainly ramping up the agility and the network, creating a networked organization has certainly helped us in this crisis. And then as we focused in on affordability, John mentioned it earlier, the revenue growth management approach has been part of -- our crisis manufacturing was born in a crisis or many crises and we have developed that capability around the world over the years -- actually over the last couple of years we had another big push to drive revenue management capability around the one. It wasn't just that we were looking for premium pricing and smaller packaging, yes we were looking for those things but they were an output of a capability we were building that is now going to be turned towards responding to the different environments that we'll see across the different countries as their macros perform. And so the system us and the bottlers, have upgraded our ability to really pivot towards affordability in whatever shape that means in the country you're in and using whichever brands is relevant in the phase we're talking about. So I think we are in the best shape we've been going into a global crisis than we have been for a long time.\nJohn Murphy: And James, if I just could add on the cost management side to sort of amplify the point on networking and agility. I think as we go into the rest of the year we've had the opportunity over the last four to six weeks to work very closely with all markets to be clear on what's fixed, what's variable, what's committed, what's non-committed, and then what are the key decision points that we will have over the coming weeks to be able to pivot us an appropriately into the second half of the year and it will be very market centric. In some markets we will want to accelerate investments and in some markets pull back. But the network that's in place the digital infrastructure we have to allow us to connect is -- certainly are elements that are serving us very well at the moment.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you, and good morning. Are you seeing at-home consumption accelerate or decelerate in April against March? And do you view the fewer shopping trips you alluded to mostly offset by commerce in most places and the negative impact, mostly localized in some countries like you said in India and epicenter cities like New York? In other words, I'm trying to see how concerned are you with center destocking at this point? Are there still a lot of out-of-stocks in your view at retail, and we could actually see at-home accelerate as you progress your revenue management initiatives? And should we expect the negative price/mix impact because of the bigger weight of the multi-serve in the next few quarters? I really appreciate. Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Taking it a bit in reverse order, yeah, if we -- if there's a big shift in the mix towards future consumption packages versus immediate consumption in any given country that will be a headwind to mix in the coming quarters. There maybe all sorts of other effects, as John mentioned some of our vertically integrated businesses have been impacted. We run the fountain business all coursed through our BIGs. So there'll be a lot of mix effects in the coming quarters, but that one will be a headwind as we think about the future quarters. In terms of the trajectory of at-home, one can't simply look at March versus April because each country is following its own path. What we see is as the virus has started to take off, you start to see footfall starting to decline in some of the away-from-home channels then the lockdown starts to get occur and you get big declines in footfall in the away-from-home channels and you get a spike in stock-up volumes in the at-home for a few weeks, and then you obviously are into the lockdown and then the numbers start to normalize and you start to see some stability in the future consumption. Now what's happening within the at-home channel is you have to I think layer on conceptually not just a closure of channels and consumers moving from A to B, but an anticipation or at least a consumer response to the uncertainty of where we're all going economically and therefore a shift in the prioritization of the categories that they buy even within the at-home channel. So, it's quite clear and it's a visible pattern not always the same categories but it's a very visible pattern around the world. You see what consumers deem as essential spikes up and stays up in the at-home channels. Some things like beverages sell more but not nearly enough to compensate for the losses in the away-from-home channels. And then some categories and the smaller SKUs get heavily deprioritized both by the customers and by the consumers. So, it's important to see those complete trends. It's certainly not the case that e-commerce is offsetting the losses from away-from-home relatively -- e-commerce even though it's doubled in sales for a beverage category it's still a very small percentage of the total beverage category. So, there's a lot of adaptation going on and you literally need to go place by place.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.\nLaurent Grandet: Hey good morning everyone and many thanks for your detailed comments on how you approach the crisis. One question on the advertising spend you mentioned in your pre-remarks you are pushing back your advertising spend to later in the year. So, could you please give us a bit more direction on how we should think about the sequencing by quarter and also by brand? And finally, also, should we think your strong innovation pipeline and for the year is now put on hold? Thank you.\nJohn Murphy: Sure. Yes.\nJames Quincey: Go on John.\nJohn Murphy: Okay. Go ahead James. Yes, so the approach as we talked for the rest of the year has been to really stay close to the consumer in a relevant way. And in the second quarter that actually means in many markets coming off air. We have had a number of communications announcing that we will take a pause for now while we focus our efforts on our communities and on other priorities and that we'll be back later in the year. But back later in the year looks like it's going to be very much dependent on the shape of the recovery. And so for the quarter the upcoming quarter, we're creating as much optionality as we can so that markets can do the right thing in the second half of the year. Tim and the team can take you through some of the implications on the -- that I alluded to in my remarks on the phasing for the rest of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carlos Laboy with HSBC. Your line is now open.\nCarlos Laboy: Yes, good morning everyone. In some key -- if some key emerging markets remain weak or go into a protracted recession here, how do you prompt North America and Europe to accelerate the pace of change and growth? There were some promising momentum what kind of things can you do to step up the rate of transformation in developed markets here?\nJames Quincey: I mean we're going to have to manage the portfolio here. Certainly, we will have to look at each part of the world and adopt the strategy and the approach and the right balance of marketing innovation, RGM, and execution that's appropriate for the macro and the context of the consumer behaviors. We had a great program and a lot of momentum coming back in the North American business and also the European business. We'll have to manage each step as we take it. I mean certainly [Technical Difficulty] and so we will have lots of things ready to roll against the different scenarios we see coming out. So, we certainly would be looking to see North America or -- and Europe doing better as we come out of the new normal.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nKevin Grundy: Thanks. Good morning everyone. We've covered a lot of ground. I wanted to ask James on emerging markets. Historically, the company has tried to offset some of these FX headwinds in EMs with pricing. But sort of building on some of your early commentary, do you foresee that some of the demand challenges broadly in a number of these key markets are going to compromise your ability to put your pricing to offset some of these FX? And how are you sort of weighing market share objectives overall health of consumer with profitability over the next 12 months? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Our starting point is the approach that we compete locally. The economics of the industry are more local than they are dollar. So we focus on staying close to consumers and the customers and competing locally to build the franchise is to gain market share and to sustain or improve profitability in a local sense. In the short-term, we do not -- that does not mean we use pricing to track and try and offset ForEx that will make us less competitive in the local context. Over the long run, clearly, as currencies devalue, they tend to import inflation and therefore the pricing over the medium-term tends to track to offset the FX. We've been hit harder this year than we expected from some of the emerging markets and we don't see ourselves pricing just to try and offset that. We will obviously be driving affordability to try and drive demand and sustain the business. And therefore, on the top line, we can try and make sure that we get the right level of profitability. Now over the last few years, we have tried to say look we do not aim for the Coca-Cola Company to just be the sum of all the local wins and occasional losses in the local marketplaces. We are pulling levers as a corporation to balance out the portfolio to achieve objectives of making sure the shareholders get returns in U.S. dollars. Clearly, this year is going to be a very atypical year. We're going to manage the year as we've described. But going into the future we will certainly be back to try and balance the three legs of the stool as we have tried in prior years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sean King with UBS. Your line is now open.\nSean King: Thank you. I wanted to dig into your commodity hedging exposure and if there is any opportunity to benefit from the relative correction we've seen in certain input prices. I mean, on the other side with ethanol production near shuttered, do you see any risk throughout the system for CO2 supply?\nJames Quincey: Sean, thanks for the question. I'm glad you raised it, because I should have highlighted in my remarks earlier with Lauren's question on commodities. The commodity outlook is favorable overall and so I expect that both the company with our finished goods businesses and indeed our bottling system can take advantage of some of those commodity pricing in the rest of the year and into 2021. On the CO2 front, yes, we're aware of the challenges, particularly in the U.S. due to the bioethanol raw gas feedstock sourcing depletion. But our team has got a number of contingency plans in place and we don't foresee an issue in the foreseeable future at this point.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.\nJames Quincey: Thank you. Coca-Cola has a history of leadership of resilience and of doing the right thing, no matter whether the times are good or whether challenges exist. And this time will be no different. We've never been better positioned than we are today to manage through this situation and come out even stronger.

Today, I\u2019d like to reflect on the past year and how we\u2019ve emerged stronger from the pandemic, including positive performance in the fourth quarter. I\u2019ll also highlight the broader macro environment and how we\u2019re executing in the marketplace. Finally, I\u2019ll touch briefly on the accelerators for growth that give us confidence we can achieve the 2022 guidance we\u2019ve provided today, with more on them to come at CAGNY next, this month. John will then discuss financial results for the quarter and our outlook in more detail. Before I get to it, I\u2019d like to acknowledge that our ability to emerge stronger would not have been possible without the efforts of our dedicated employees and system partners around the world, and I\u2019d like to thank them for their hard work, their contribution not only to our results, but to our curious, empowered, inclusive and agile culture. In 2021, the operating environment remained dynamic as the pandemic continued to evolve, and factors like inflation and supply chain disruptions brought additional challenges. But over the year, our organization and system continued to manage through these circumstances with focus and flexibility. We are pleased with the results, which were above 2019 across key metrics, and we remain focused on building a stronger total beverage company. Now, looking more closely at our fourth quarter results. We saw another quarter of sequential improvement versus 2019, and we ended the year with volume ahead of 2019. Notably, it was the first quarter in which away-from-home volume was also ahead of 2019, while at-home channels remained strong. So, recapping the quarter four performance around the world, starting with Asia Pacific. China delivered strong performance in the quarter by capturing a growing trend among consumers of zero-calorie offerings, we doubled our Zero Sugar sparkling portfolio in terms of volume compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. We leveraged RGM strategies and targeting investments to gain share in e-commerce, thus driving growth for the overall business. In India, initiatives to build omnichannel presence and marketing campaigns around key occasions by leveraging festivals and passion points through occasion-led marketing and integrated execution drove a sequential increase in market share and nearly 30% growth in transactions for the quarter. Additionally, our local Thums Up brand became $1 billion brand in India, driven by focused marketing and execution plans. In Japan, while our system was faced with a very challenging year, we gained value share and consumers driven by successful innovation and commercial strategies. In ASEAN and South Pacific, there were strict restrictions and limited reopenings in many markets for a large part of the year. In Q4, acceleration of vaccine efforts and strong results from the Fanta Colorful People and Sprite Make it Clear campaigns helped drive our recovery. In EMEA, volume in Europe in the quarter surpassed 2019 despite mobility restrictions, particularly in Western Europe. Despite the recovery remaining asynchronous in the region, increased investments behind our brands in the marketplace resulted in our system driving the highest incremental retail value among FMCG players in the region. In Africa, volume continued to be ahead of 2019 in the fourth quarter, driven by our key markets with strong double-digit growth in Nigeria and Egypt. Additionally, increased investments behind our affordability and multi-serve packages drove value share for the full year above 2019 in the region. In Eurasia and Middle East, the top line continued to expand faster than the macro environment, driven by strong revenue growth management, execution and digital capabilities. Turkey, one of our key markets, grew 7 points of value share for the year in digital as total digital commerce expanded by close to 90%. In North America, despite COVID cases leading to business closings and some mobility restrictions, value share growth was strong in the quarter, driven by pricing, revenue growth management and strong execution in the market. The new Coca-Cola Zero Sugar continued to deliver strong results, outpacing category growth, while Sprite and smartwater grew drinker base and buy rates. Innovations also delivered strong performances, led by Coke with Coffee and Simply Almond. Latin America delivered another quarter of strong performance with mid-single-digit volume growth versus 2019. This resilience of the system has been driven by years of experience navigating volatile environments through strong and effective execution. Within Global Ventures, Costa continued to recover through the year but was impacted in Q4 due to COVID-related restrictions. Costa Express continued its strong performance in the UK, delivering results ahead of expectations. In China, the Costa ready-to-drink expansion continued its availability now in more than 300,000 outlets, continuing to drive a share position ahead of our key competitor. Finally, our Bottling Investments Group continued to focus on productivity and transformation initiatives, delivering strong operating margin expansion for full year 2021. Due to improved mobility throughout the year, our industry is growing in both, volume and value. Gaining share was a key objective in our emerging stronger agenda. And this year, we gained value share in both, at-home and away-from-home channels. Our NARTD market share is above 2019 levels at a global level and in both at-home and away-from-home channels. We will continue to identify and address opportunities to further improve our value share, driven by data-backed insights. As we close the chapter on 2021, we emerged stronger by delivering both top line and EPS ahead of 2019, and we gained share in a growing industry. The actions we took during the pandemic have resulted in an agile and focused organization that is poised to capture the sizable opportunities that exist, and we continue to look to the future to build on our momentum and drive growth. As we turn to 2022, while it is impossible for us to know whether this variant will be the last, what is clear is that our consumers, our customers and our business are learning and adapting with great resilience. For example, while we have seen some impacts from the Omicron variant through the first few weeks of the year, we are not seeing the same level of disruption as previous waves, and our system is better equipped. Further recovery in 2022 will be determined by macro factors, including overall consumer sentiment as well as supply chain challenges; labor shortages; and of course, the inflationary pressures in interest rates. We are confident we are well equipped to navigate this environment and deliver on the guidance we provided today. Now, I\u2019ll touch on some of the capabilities we\u2019ve built to unlock the next stage of growth and will elaborate more at our virtual CAGNY presentation later this month. We\u2019re excited about where we are today and the substantial initiatives we have in place for 2022. The consumer continues to be at the center of our strategy. And through our total beverage company agenda, we are adapting to the macro and micro trends, which are shaping consumer habits. We advanced our total beverage company agenda last year by streamlining our portfolio, focusing on the core and investing behind a portfolio of brands that allows us to meet the evolving needs of consumers. We completed much of this work on brand eliminations while being deliberate with brand transitions. This optimized portfolio will ensure we follow the consumer and win in emerging and fast-growing categories, and is complemented by the recent strategic acquisition of BODYARMOR as well as relationships like the new agreement with Constellation Brands, which will launch Fresca Mixed, and the extended relationship with Molson Coors, which will launch Simply Spiked Lemonade in the U.S. Our network marketing model, with global category teams and local operating units, is allowing us to focus on end-to-end consumer experiences that are data-driven and always on. Our announcement of WPP as our global marketing network partner is a foundational component of our new marketing model. This new agency approach gives us access to the best created lines, regardless of source, and is underpinned by leading-edge data and technology capabilities. The Real Magic campaign is the first campaign, which was cocreated internally, leveraging this new end-to-end approach, and the campaign is showing strong results with the consumers. We have good visibility into the benefits of the new marketing model. The approach will allow us to deliver best-in-class consumer-centric marketing experiences across our categories and around the world. We also built more discipline into our innovation process in 2021 with a key focus on scalable bets that can build momentum year-over-year. It\u2019s still early, but the approach is working. Revenue per launch and gross profit per launch were up 30% and 25%, respectively, versus prior year. And we took intelligent local experiments and move more rapidly to scale them across geographies. Sustainable packaging like refillables and labelless bottles, along with brands like Coke with Coffee, fairlife, AHA, Costa ready-to-drink and Lemon-Dou are all examples of local winners that have been extended to more markets. For 2022, our innovation process is increasingly supported by data, and our pipeline is robust with built-in agility and consists of big bets along with many shots on goal. The system has stepped up its RGM and execution capabilities, which is helping us navigate an inflationary environment, driving value growth in a segmented way. Due to the strength of our bottling partners and the stronger net alignment of the system, we are prepared to address opportunities as well as challenges may lie ahead. Our networked organizational structure is designed to better connect functions and operating units to help our system scale ideas faster. As we\u2019ve emerged stronger, we kept moving forward on integrating sustainability work into our business as it is a key driver of future growth. During the quarter, we were recognized for our commitment to transparency, an action to address environmental risks by earning an A score in CDP\u2019s assessment for water, an improvement over last year. We improved or maintained our score in CDP\u2019s assessments on other important areas like climate and forests. Additionally, to complement our World Without Waste goals, we announced a new global goal to reach 25% reusable packaging by 2030. Increasing refillable and reusable packaging options responds to consumer affordability and our sustainability aspirations, and it helps create a circular economy, and refillable packages have extremely high levels of collection and our low-carbon footprint beverage containers. Before I turn over to John, I want to say a big thank you and recognize our associates from both the Company and our bottling partners, who work with great dedication and unwavering commitment throughout another challenging year. We expect the recovery will remain asynchronous, but we are encouraged by our growing industry, our own parallel system strength, and a strategic transformation that enables us to be agile and to adapt. Our actions drove strong results in 2021. And we have confidence in our ability to deliver another year of strong performance in 2022 and over the long term. Now, John will provide more details on our results and our 2020 guidance.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we closed the year with strong results, despite the impact of the Omicron variant across many parts of the world. Our Q4 organic revenue growth was 9%. Our price/mix of 10% was driven by a combination of factors, including targeted pricing, revenue growth management initiatives as well as further improvement in away-from-home channels in many markets. Unit case growth showed further sequential improvement on a two-year basis and concentrate sales like unit cases by 10 points in the quarter, primarily due to six fewer days in the quarter. Despite commodity market inflation and the dynamic supply chain environment, comparable gross margin for the quarter was relatively flat versus prior year. Pricing initiatives and favorable channel and package mix were offset by the impact of consolidating the fast-growing finished goods, BODYARMOR business, along with incremental investments to sustain momentum in the overall business for 2022. We continued to invest in markets as they recovered and stepped up year-over-year marketing dollars again in Q4, spending in a targeted way to maximize returns. This increase in marketing investments, along with some top line pressure from six fewer days in the quarter, resulted in comparable operating margin compression of approximately 500 basis points for the quarter. For the full year, comparable operating margin was down approximately 100 basis points versus prior year as improved comparable gross margin was offset by the significant step-up in marketing. Importantly, versus 2019, a key measure we have focused on, comparable operating margin was up approximately 100 basis points. Putting it all together, fourth quarter comparable earnings per share of $0.45 was a decline of 5% year-over-year, resulting in full year comparable earnings per share of $2.32, an increase of 19% versus the prior year, as a strong resurgence in the business also benefited from a 3-point tailwind from currency and tax. We delivered strong free cash flow of $11.3 billion in 2021, with free cash flow conversion of approximately 115% and a dividend payout ratio well below our long-term target of 75%. With these results, we exceeded guidance on every metric for full year 2021. We have done tremendous work to emerge ahead of 2019 and set the stage to drive our growth agenda for years to come. We are spinning the strategy flywheels faster and more effectively. Our organization is focused on execution and enhancing our capabilities to fuel growth. As James mentioned, the pandemic will be one of the many factors, along with the dynamic macro backdrop that we face in the coming year. But our local businesses are ready to adapt and execute for growth. With that in mind, this morning, we provided guidance for 2022 that builds on momentum from 2021. We expect organic revenue growth of approximately 7% to 8%, and we expect comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 8% to 10% versus 2021. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate 3-point currency headwind to comparable revenue and an approximate 3 to 4 points currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022. Additionally, due to a certain change in recent regulations, we estimate an effective tax rate increase from 18.6% in 2021 to 20% for 2022, which is an estimated 2 percentage points headwind to EPS. Therefore, all-in, we expect comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus 2021, including the combined 5- to 6-point headwind from currency and tax. We expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow of 2022 through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments. This implies the fourth consecutive year of free cash flow conversion above our long-term range of 90% to 95%. We continue to raise the performance bar across the organization and are confident in delivering on this 2022 guidance. In summary, we expect to deliver another year of strong topline-driven growth, along with maximized returns, driven by the strategic changes we have made in our business. There are several considerations to keep in mind for 2022. Overall, inflationary and supply chain pressures continue to impact costs across several fronts in the business, including input costs, transportation, marketing and operating expenses. With regards to commodity costs, after benefiting from our hedging strategy in 2021, we remain well hedged in 2022, but at higher levels. Based on current rates and hedge positions, we continue to expect commodity price inflation to have a mid-single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2022. However, we are taking actions in the marketplace using multiple levers, including RGM in its many forms, along with our productivity initiatives, to help offset much of the impact. As a reminder, for your modeling, the consolidation of the recently acquired fast-growing BODYARMOR finished goods business will have a mechanical effect on margins. When it comes to capital allocation, our balance sheet remains strong, and our improving cash flow position is allowing us to be even more vigorous in pursuit of priorities that balance financial flexibility with efficient capital structure, first and foremost, to invest in our business; secondly, continuing our track record to grow our dividend; thirdly, to seek opportune M&A and to repurchase shares with excess cash. And finally, due to the calendar shift, there will be one less day in the first quarter and one additional day in the fourth quarter. Despite another year of uncertainty, in 2021, we came together as a system to emerge stronger and position ourselves to drive sustainable growth. We are encouraged by the momentum in our business and are clear on the direction we\u2019re headed. As we look to 2022, we feel confident in our ability to deliver on the commitments we outlined today.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey. God morning. So, I wanted to focus on the 7% to 8% organic sales growth guidance for 2022, obviously, a robust level. Can you give us a bit more detail around the key drivers there? And I\u2019m wondering specifically how much of a tailwind is less COVID impact for 2022 that occurred in 2021 or above-trend pricing, given the cost situation and limited demand elasticity relative to a typical year? And the point behind the question is sort of why are you above the 4% to 6% long-term algorithm? Is it more sustainable factors that can sustain as we look beyond 2022? Is it more -- factors more specific for 2022? It would be helpful to have a bit more detail there. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Good morning, Dara. Firstly, we\u2019re coming out of 2021 with good strong momentum. We\u2019ve seen an improvement on the growth rate relative to 2019, both in the at-home channels and the away-from-home channels. So, we\u2019re coming into the year with good momentum, notwithstanding some ups and downs due to Omicron in certain parts of the world in December and January. And I\u2019m going to answer the second part first. The above algorithm growth in 2022 is more primarily due to the factors of COVID and inflation, but I\u2019ll come back to that. And so, as you look out into the long-term, it is much more likely we will move back into the long-term algorithm. Just to refresh, we\u2019re in a robust industry that has been growing historically. It\u2019s coming back to growth. And if that\u2019s an industry that\u2019s growing at 4% or 5%, and we have a long-term track record of gaining share in the industry, you can see why we focus attention on being in the top half of the revenue growth rate in the algorithm we put out that allows us to then drive the business into the future. So, we still think that is a sound long-term perspective in terms of both the industry growth rate and our ability, not just to be the leader but to be the winner in terms of share and to drive in the top half of the algorithm. Coming back to the near-term and 2022, in particular, a couple of things that support an above algorithm number. Firstly, there are a number of countries that are not yet back at their 2019 levels of revenue or indeed, even volume. And whilst we are not expecting everything to be rosy in 2022, we do expect to see ongoing improvements around the world in terms of reopening, in terms of reactivation. And so, we think there are additional tailwinds in 2022 from a reopening perspective that will support the volume side. And then, in terms of pricing, clearly, it\u2019s a slightly more inflationary environment than normal. And we, as we have talked on previous calls with our bottling partners, very much look to price in the marketplace. We do have a view that we have to have brands that earn the right to take pricing. And secondly, we very much are not looking to just pass through in price but to do it intelligently because, whilst it\u2019s easy to respond to inflation by putting up the prices, there is clearly, as there is broad-based inflation, going to be a squeeze on real incomes in a number of countries. And so, we -- with very long experience in the system of managing inflationary moments when you get a squeeze on real incomes, we very much want to, yes, the company opportunities on premiumization, leverage our strong marketing, leverage our strong innovation. But we do not want to lose consumers out of the industry, so we also will have a foot in affordability. And this is a scenario where we have a lot of experience. The system has a lot of experience, and we intend to push it forward. The net of all that is likely to mean that we see a balance between volume and price/mix within the overall revenue guidance that we\u2019ve given you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. The first thing is not a question. It\u2019s just I\u2019m going to mention the free cash conversion and leave it at that and say, my goodness, how much things have changed. My question though was that I wanted to talk a little bit about North America supply chain. My understanding is there\u2019s -- that\u2019s still been pretty challenged. And I just was looking for any kind of update you could offer on fourth quarter and outlook into next year. Because clearly, the market share performance, everything is great, but that\u2019s still with the supply chain constraints. And I was wondering how that\u2019s shaping up. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. So, I think the system in the U.S. has done an exceptional job in trying to manage through all the different needles that needed to be threaded in terms of the supply chain to provide the brands for our consumers and our customers and have availability of the product. Was it perfect last year? No. Is it likely to be perfect this year? No. But, we are doing the maximum we can to optimize our full availability. And there are issues across a number of dimensions. I would say two things on the line - underlie this, and we can take some examples. There is two effects going on. One, which I\u2019ve talked about on previous calls, which is the kind of the temporal supply shock. When you have a crisis, things whip around. You suddenly sell less fountain and want to sell more cans, and the system is not set up for that. And so, you get these kind of big swings, a bit like the famous case study of the video game business school. And there you get the shock waves of like in earthquake that continue to ripple through the system. And so, we saw that last year, and we will see some of that again in 2022. But they\u2019re temporal. But also there, I believe, were a set of underlying structural squeezes going on in the supply chain that perhaps had not been fully addressed by ourselves or by the industries involved, pre-COVID. And the advent of COVID just doubled down the pressure on them. So, examples of that would be trucking and freight in the U.S. There\u2019s been a long-term squeeze on the availability of trucking, whether it be the hours, regulations, the aging out of the drivers. You had COVID where people didn\u2019t take the test. And so, some of these structural problems are coming home to roost. Everyone, including ourselves, are very involved in fixing them. Similarly, for example, on cans, can capacity, manufacturing accounts have been flat for a decade, but really can use and attraction that have been creeping up. And that just got squeezed as the away-from-home closed and the at-home spiked up in COVID. People are building new canning plants. New capacity is coming online. So, I think what you\u2019re going to see play out through 2022 is the reduction in the kind of temporal amplitudes from the swings from COVID and the steady fixing of some of these structural issues that will still take some time through 2022. Obviously, we are going to do the maximum possible to leverage our portfolio of brands, our portfolio of packaging options to maximize our ability to put the drinks into the hands where the people want them and the customers want to sell them.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets.\nFilippo Falorni: Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Filippo Falorni on for Nick. So first, on your outlook, can you discuss what level of global consumer mobility are you assuming relative to 2019 levels? And whether the lower impact that you saw from Omicron compared to prior waves gives you more confidence that your trends are decoupling from COVID cases and the away-from-home business? And if you can comment on the benefit from your recent reorganization in terms of better market share and better topline growth performance. Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Well, clearly, we\u2019ve been gaining market share. And my favorite metric is market share versus 2019, both in the away-from-home and at-home channels we\u2019ve gained overall. We\u2019ve gained in the away-from-home and we\u2019ve gained in the at-home. And we are -- in terms of consumer business, we are assuming a greater degree of reopening. We can certainly begin to see that in Europe as the Omicron variant has moved through. The U.S., just this week, mask mandates are coming down. So, there is going to be an improvement in mobility across the world. It\u2019s not going to be back to 2019 fully in 2022. And I think that\u2019s going to be true, both in terms of domestic mobility and international mobility, I don\u2019t know if you meant per country or people moving around the world. But anyway, the answer is basically the same, which is we are assuming an improvement in mobility, but we\u2019re not assuming a return yet to the full 2019 levels.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: John, I had a question just about the guidance. And if we look at the currency neutral spread between earnings growth and organic sales growth, can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of where the leverage in the income statement will be? Because the tax rates moving up, interest expense, net interest expense, I guess, will be higher because of the BODYARMOR deal. So, it didn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s a lot of leverage below the operating income line. So, I was just trying to get a better understanding of just where the leverage is in the net -- on the P&L.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Bryan. Yes, on the -- as you walk down through the P&L, currency neutral, I think on the first point is top line is very robust. We have done a really nice job, I think, going into \u201822 on optimizing to our RGM efforts and the innovation pipeline that we have at play. And then, secondly, coming out of the reorg work that we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years, we are doing I think a much tighter job on overall resource allocation, finding a good balance between investing as we need to for -- to support the top line, but also taking into account the opportunities that we have driven in the efficiency work that we have done. So, I feel confident that we have some flex from the gross margin line down in the currency neutral basis. And below the operating line are actually our net interest expense, given the tremendous work we\u2019ve done to completely restructure our debt portfolio, is actually a net benefit for us in 2022.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: A couple of things on just kind of understanding the balance between the pricing needs of your own and the commodity inflation you\u2019re seeing versus the kind of pricing needs of your bottlers? I certainly understand that you work as a system, but you\u2019re obviously different businesses and different regions and such. So, how do you work that balance between the two?\nJames Quincey: Let me separate the businesses into the vast majority of the business, which goes through the bottling system, and then some businesses that go in parallel. When we\u2019re talking about pricing needs of the concentrate business a bit that goes through the bottler, in the almost all cases, we have a system whereby we operate what\u2019s called incidence pricing. So, we have agreements with the bottlers where our revenue will be a percent of the revenues that they achieve in the marketplace. So therefore, we are both incentivized to work diligently to increase the total size of the pie in a much more aligned way in terms of both trying to drive the same outcome. So, in that sense, the bottlers -- we work together and the bottlers take the pricing in the marketplace, whether it\u2019s rate pricing or working on the mix between the brands and the packages and the channels, and then we take a percentage of that. And of course, we\u2019re both looking at the various input cost challenges that we have, and we work through and come up with a pricing plan, and the bottlers take that to the marketplace and get it done. We do have a few businesses where we sell the finished goods, whether that be some of the, for example, the chilled juice businesses here in the U.S. or in Europe or the Costa business or the BIG business. Clearly, there, we\u2019re operating the vertically integrated businesses, and we\u2019re doing very much what we do with the bottlers we do our own for those businesses, and we work it all through. So, I think you can take it as we work very much in alignment working back from the consumer, trying to drive value for the customers. And we manage the portfolio of all the different input costs, including our needs to kind of invest in marketing, invest in innovation and invest in execution capacity as the bottlers would do.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JP Morgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: My question is on the pricing that you embed in your guide. And is it pricing actions yet to be implemented or already in the market? And can you elaborate a bit more on -- James, on your commentary about balancing volumes and pricing in 2022, which implies you probably expect an additional low-single-digit volume growth in 2022. And is that predicated mostly on the on-premise recovering as you pointed out, and an improvement in supply of cans and how we should parse it out? Thank you very much. \nJames Quincey: Sure. So, yes, clearly by saying we\u2019re expecting a balance between volume and price in our overall revenue guidance, there is an implicit volume growth that is broad based geographically, obviously more tends to be faster -- rather tends to be in the emerging markets and slower in the developed markets. Yes, it predicated on improvements in away-from-home, particularly in those countries, which are not yet back to 2019 levels. We have -- whilst we have emerged stronger and our total business is bigger than it was in 2019, whether that be volume, revenue or profits, that is not true in every country. And so, -- and actually, in total, away-from-home is not back to where it was in 2019. So, there\u2019s clearly more or less to come back, which is why effectively implicitly, there\u2019s a little more volume into 2022 guidance than in the normal long-term algorithm. And similarly, with price/mix, as I commented earlier, it\u2019s going to be implicitly a little more than usual. And I think you\u2019ll have to kind of look at -- I would encourage everyone to look at some of the two-year stack rates in terms of volume and price to look at how it\u2019s been moving by group and by business segment, as you think about your modeling going into 2022.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey: Just following up on that line of -- that line around channel mix is going into next year and how that factors into volume. Certainly, channel mix should be a pretty good story for gross margins going into next year. Would you expect sequential improvement from the Q4 level with the away-from-home being ahead of 2019 levels for the first time? Would you expect, barring geopolitical risk or otherwise, that, that sequential improvement should continue? And can you just frame how we should be thinking about how that might benefit your gross margin rate for the year? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Chris. And just to confirm, you\u2019re talking about sequential improvement in gross margins?\nChris Carey: Sequential improvement in the away-from-home business from the Q4.\nJames Quincey: Right.\nChris Carey: And how that can impact and benefit your gross margins as you get through the year?\nJames Quincey: Yes. Okay. Clearly, as we talked about on the last question, we are expecting some extra improvement in the away-from-home going into 2022. As I said, it\u2019s not yet back to the 2019 levels, and that is a plus from a gross margin point of view. I would not want to characterize that as the biggest thing happening next year. There\u2019s a lot more moving pieces going on. So, I think it is a factor. It\u2019s probably more important, the overall growth of the business and the reopenings in the different geographies. But I think that\u2019s the key. I think, John, do you want to add anything?\nJohn Murphy: Yes. No, I think it\u2019s a good juncture maybe to just say a little bit about gross margins, because I know there will be questions on what we expect. And I think I\u2019d like to just emphasize there\u2019s really several factors that are playing into the 2022 picture. We do have the mechanical effect of the BODYARMOR acquisition that, I think, is important to take into account we had a slight currency tailwind in \u201821, and that\u2019s going to be kind of negated with a similar expected headwind in 2022. I think it\u2019s important to keep in mind what we discussed on the impact of the commodity pressures. There will be, I think offsetting against that, the benefit of some of the pricing power and brand leadership that we have that James has mentioned. And that will, I think, also be complemented by an improving channel mix outlook. But I think it\u2019s important to take into account all of the factors and hence, -- that feeds into the guidance that we provided this morning.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Carlos Laboy from HSBC.\nCarlos Laboy: First of all, congratulations on this 25% refillable goal, because it redirects the industry, this course, completely for investors on PET waste solutions. My question is about marketing and innovation. What might worry you about readiness for normality and about these new marketing and innovation processes for creating new demand and new brand equity for pricing power?\nJames Quincey: Well, thank you for calling out the reusable goal, Carlos. Clearly, achieving it will mean using much less of virgin PET and make it easier to achieve our objectives of a World Without Waste, where we intend to collect back a bottle or can for every one we sell by 2030. In terms of the marketing and the innovation question, I\u2019m not quite sure I completely captured what you\u2019re going for. But let me throw out some thoughts, and I think that will help. The consumer elasticity and pricing power, yes, I think a lot of people have noted, it\u2019s been relatively inelastic in recent times. It\u2019s certainly our historical experience that when multiple categories go off at the same time, there is less elasticity. But it is also our experience that often that it\u2019s in an environment of a crisis where there\u2019s a support of a lot of injection of money into the economy, which I think is what has been happening over the last couple of years. Eventually, it moves to another phase where there\u2019s inflation and a squeeze on the income. And so, we are very attuned to the need to be -- burn our pricing as we go forward. And earnings, whether it\u2019s with the marketing that really engages with the consumers, whether it\u2019s with the innovation that, again, engages with the consumers and gives our customers the opportunity to do different things and more interesting things in the stores or whether we earn it through the excellence in execution and the in-store presence that our bottling partners are so good at. Because the next phase is much harder than the previous phase. It\u2019s easier to do pricing in a stimulus environment where everyone else is going up. It\u2019s much harder when there\u2019s a real squeeze on income. So we\u2019re very focused on winning in the next phase. It\u2019s something that we and our bottling partners have a lot of experience with, and it will certainly be an opportunity and a necessity to deploy the whole toolkit from marketing innovation through execution to continue winning as we go forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: I guess, it kind of builds on that theme. I\u2019m thinking about it in the context of the \u201822 outlook. And I missed all the cost pressures that we\u2019ve spoken about and your plans to drive forward operating leverage and continued progress on operating profit. I guess, can you just talk a little bit more about the invented flexibility you have and your plans around strategic investments in \u201822 specifically? Where those are targeted? What level of strategic investment, whether it\u2019s A&P or capabilities building? Just to give us a little bit more context about your ability to support the volume momentum, justify pricing, not only in \u201822, but to set yourself up for \u201823 and beyond. Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. I mean, we have a kind of approach where we\u2019ve come. We switched during the crisis and leaning into growth or a bias to invest. As you can see through the course of the crisis and into 2021, we steadily increased our level of investment on marketing, restarted the engines on innovation. And similarly, the bottlers will do so on execution and actually investments in supply chain. So that\u2019s our bias going into the year. We\u2019re going to invest for growth. We\u2019ve got a lot of ability drive not just the market innovation, but also underline the advances in the digitization of the business, whether it\u2019s the connection with the consumer, whether it\u2019s the connection with the retailers and what the bottlers are doing to digitize that part of the business. So, we are leaning into growth. But what we have achieved over the last few years is to increase our degree of flexibility or adaptability. Better said, it\u2019s not that everyone is sitting out there with talks of flexibility, it\u2019s more that we can adapt as circumstances change. We doubled down on our ability to make quicker, clearer decisions coming in to the crisis. And with the reorganization that we did recently -- have a more networked organization, we feel good about our ability to prioritize and redirect resources as and when needed during the year, whether that\u2019s to move from one part of the world to the other or one brand to another, or even to pull back where the growth is not there. So, we feel we\u2019ve got the levers, the hand, and we feel we\u2019ve become more agile in using them.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities.\nBill Chappell: I just wanted -- a quick question on Costa -- or not quick, but a question on Costa and kind of how you\u2019re viewing it going forward. I guess, two, three years ago, when it was purchased, there was kind of a thought there was going to be a big splash or a bigger splash into coffee for the system. And obviously, the pandemic showed up. But at the same point, you\u2019ve kind of moved more aggressively into alcohol and to BODYARMOR and to other things. And so, I didn\u2019t know if the thought process has changed or evolved in terms of wanting to move forward and expand that kind of worldwide, or if it\u2019s another kind of arrow in the quiver, which was always part of the plan. Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: Sure. I think the short answer first, it was always intended to be one of the arrows in the quiver. The longer version of that answer is clearly COVID impacted, not just our total business, but it impacted the cost of business, which is an almost entirely away-from-home business. And so, it was very much a bit like our fountain business in the U.S. It was very much in the crosshairs of the COVID impact, particularly in 2020 at the beginning when the lockdowns were very severe. And in fact, most of those coffee shops are all closed in 2020. So, it was very hard on the Costa business. The 2021 made a lot of progress, reopenings, not back to where we were yet, so the coffee stores are bouncing back, but not back to where they were yet. The vision we have for coffee included a number of other components. One was the Express machines, the digital kind of barista. Obviously, 2020 was hard to install new machines, but the performance of the existing machines was extraordinary and very positive, and that last year, we began to install thousands of new machines. And then, we\u2019ve launched, partnered with our bottlers to have Proud to Serve, where they provide the beans and machines to the HORECA channel. And we\u2019ve launched a ready-to-drink, where it\u2019s done really well in certain parts of the world. So, the vision is still there. We see it as one of the arrows in the quiver. Clearly, we\u2019ve lost a couple of years. I mean, there\u2019s no beating around the bush, and we\u2019re going to have to bounce back from it. But the learnings we had and the experience was where we were able to do things give us some confidence and belief that we need -- that we have an opportunity to execute against the vision, which, of course, we still need to do.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Question for John on share repurchases. And I\u2019d also like to tie it into the bottling divestitures and potential proceeds there because the topic is related. So again, to echo sentiment earlier, great job on improving free cash flow conversion. That\u2019s outstanding. As you sit here now at $10 billion in share buybacks, in addition to the fact that you have the CCBA offering coming up later this year, you\u2019ve been very clear about your intent to divest the remaining bottling assets. So, kind of tying this together, number one, what are thoughts? What\u2019s embedded on repurchases? When can you get back to that? The Company has been fairly inactive for reasons that we understand. And then, relatedly, with the proceeds from CCBA and what potentially may come in the near to intermediate term around further bottling divestitures, does it seem likely that you would put that -- put those proceeds towards buybacks? So, thanks for your comments there.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Kevin. Yes, there was a -- the reason we used the word sort of a more vigorous pursuit in the script because as you said, the -- our situation today is very different to where it was and not that long ago with our free cash conversion gone from 70% to over 100%. Our net debt leverage has gone from outside of our range to at the low end of it. Dividend conversion is now at 70%, more or less. And as I mentioned on the call, the restructuring of the debt portfolio has been a very robust piece of work. So, as we look through the future, I think at your question, we need to touch it in the context of the broader capital allocation agenda. We continue to prioritize growth of the business. We touched upon some of that in the earlier questions, both in terms of the capital that we need to drive some of the businesses that we\u2019re in and the marketing that we need to support the brands. Secondly, we don\u2019t waver from our ongoing support and objective to continue to grow the dividend. And then, we\u2019re left with the two more dynamic areas, the M&A agenda and share repo. So, on both of those, we -- I think M&A will be opportunistic. There\u2019s not a lot of obvious candidates out there, but we will continue to be very open to that whole area. And not on this call on the whole topic of share repurchases, but it\u2019s certainly an area that with excess cash that as we have communicated in the past, we will love to leverage. So, more to come on those topics as we go through the year. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet from Guggenheim.\nLaurent Grandet: Hey. Good morning, James, John. I\u2019d like to forgive this morning on BODYARMOR. So, if I\u2019m correct, BODYARMOR manufacturing is not expected to migrate to the concentrate model this year in the U.S., but wherever you are launching it internationally and the brand will be in the concentrate model. So, if I\u2019m correct, and please correct me if I\u2019m not, when are you planning to migrate the U.S. manufacturing to the concentrate model? And obviously it has a significant impact on top line margins. And also any indication of your launch plan outside of the U.S. would be great. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Thanks, Laurent. I mean, as you say, it\u2019s -- and as John has noted, it\u2019s a finished product business that we are integrating into our company and have had some mechanical effects. And as you say, we have not chosen to change it to a concentrate model. In fact, to be more specific, we\u2019re keeping the current operating model where the manufacturing of the product is largely done with co-packers. And that is what has been driving the momentum, and we have no plans to change the model with using the co-packers at this stage. They\u2019re doing a great job. And then obviously, the distribution of the product is done through the Coke bottling system here in the U.S. If we were to try and change the concentrate model, that we would let you know in due course. We have no immediate plans to do so. Again, it would be a mechanical effect on the revenue and the gross margin because it wouldn\u2019t be changing the profit coming from BODYARMOR. It would be more of a mechanical effect on the top -- on the gross margin for operating model reasons. But as I said, our intention is to operate it very broadly as we do at the moment, connected but not integrated, so that we can continue to drive the growth at what has been a very successful brand. They tripled sales in the last 3 years, gained a lot of share in the sports drink category, actually expanded the category and has done a really good job. So, we\u2019re going to kind of keep focused on driving that into more success in the current year. Then, as we expand internationally, we have not decided where and when as of yet. We will be doing that work this year. And then, as we get there, we will, of course, in that process, look at the appropriate operating model, whether there\u2019s any -- whether it should be finished product or concentrate. Clearly, our preferred route to market is to the bottlers, and it will certainly seem to make more sense to organize it as a concentrate model, whether that\u2019s then co-packed or produced by the bottlers is very situational and capacity-driven. But, see the concentrate versus finished product as a mechanical effect on top line rather than an impact on the bottom line. But our focus is driving the growth of the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore.\nRob Ottenstein: James, you\u2019ve done a lot over the last couple of years in terms of the organization and the culture to drive more agility, accountability, leaner, reward risk-taking. So, wondering if you maybe can talk about how that has played out in your mind. Maybe kind of benchmark or kind of give yourself a report card on that. And any new moves or further evolution of that this year? And then, more specifically, one of the actions that you took was the brand and SKU rationalization. Can you quantify the impact of that on results in \u201821? And any potential results in \u201822? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I\u2019m going to go with the back half of -- or we\u2019ll call it one question. I\u2019ll go with the back half of the expanded question firstly and then come back to it. The rationalization of the brands and SKUs -- and remember that that rationalization, some of the brands we stopped. Some of them, we transitioned into other brand names. And some of them -- actually a couple of them, we either discontinue to solve. My take is the impact in 2021 was minimal, and the impact in 2022 is going to be negligible. And the reason I say that is, firstly, the sum of all these brands was a relatively small, low-single-digit percent of sales and contribution, but was a high -- a much higher number in terms of occupation of SKUs and mind space and supply chain. And so, we\u2019ve removed the slower growing or declining brands with the least long-term potential to be leaders in their categories to free up more space or the brands that really are moving and for future innovations and future brands. So actually, I\u2019m entirely comfortable making the argument that even just stopping them actually could have been positive to sales and profit, but it freed up space for those brands and those SKUs that are doing much better. So, I think it was -- if you\u2019d like to say it was pruning the garden to let the better plants grow. And so I actually see it as positive to the business, even though you\u2019re cutting off something that in theory has some sales and profits. And we are largely complete with that process. We\u2019ve -- the brand eliminations is about 75%, and we\u2019re not quite halfway with the brand transition. So, we\u2019re in good shape, but I wouldn\u2019t -- if you\u2019re thinking about it from a modeling point of view, I would just like assume it\u2019s negligible. In terms of the culture in the organization, clearly, we made a lot of moves. We\u2019re very-focused on driving agility of the organization in terms of the culture and the growth behaviors and staying constructively discontent about the future and looking for the opportunities. I think we still have another year to bet down what we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years, big changes in the marketing model. We\u2019ve got some campaigns coming out already. They\u2019re doing very well in the marketplace. We\u2019re pleased with consumer impact and the effectiveness of them. We\u2019ve obviously got our platform services that are up and running. But there\u2019s like, you have to do X before you can do Y before you can do Z. And so, we still have things left to do to bring that to the kind of level of performance that we\u2019re looking for, similarly in terms of some of the supply chain stuff. So, I think we should see 2022 as a year of really fine-tuning and optimizing the work that we\u2019ve done in terms of the organization over the last couple of years and continue to really focus the culture on a growth mindset.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for closing remarks.\nJames Quincey: Great. Thanks very much, everyone. To summarize, as we move to 2022, our flywheels for growth are really working in unison, propelling the organization. We\u2019re going to drive topline growth, maximize returns. And again, it\u2019s an attractive and growing industry. Our innovation pipeline is robust and scale for impact. Our marketing agenda is designed to deliver the most effective consumer engagement with agility and speed. Our bottlers are engaged and executing the marketplace. And we\u2019re bringing this vision to life. So, thank you for your interest, your investment in the company and for joining us this morning.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

After a strong first half of the year, we saw continued momentum in our business in the third quarter. While the global recovery remains asynchronous, our people and our system are leveraging the learning that deliver good results and emerge stronger. And while markets are at different stages of reopening around the world, our local businesses have been increasingly resilient through restrictions and lock-downs. As a result, our underlying volumes have accelerated on a two-year basis with quarterly growth versus 2019 for the first time since the pandemic began. This improvement has been supported by our transformation agenda, which set us on a path to more efficient and effective marketing, as well as more disciplined and intelligent innovation. We are investing accordingly behind our portfolio of loved brands and are seeing signs of early traction. Given strong results year-to-date, and increased visibility into the rest of the year, we expect to deliver organic revenue at the high end of our previously provided range and are raising bottom line and cash flow guidance for the full year. This morning, I'll provide a business update and discuss how our network organization is executing well in this dynamic environment. Then John will discuss our financials and raised guidance and some early considerations for 2022.  In the first half of 2021, mobility and business levels improved in many markets, as lock-downs eased and vaccinations increased. The recovery has not been a straight-line, and continues to be uneven around the world. But despite the asynchronous recovery, in the third quarter, our volumes surpassed 2019 levels for the first time since the pandemic began. Although not yet back to 2019 levels as a percent of our business, we saw sequential improvement in away from home volumes on a two-year basis, as consumers return to many of their former routines. At-home volumes also showed ongoing strength even as away-from-home channels improved. The quarter was off to a promising start in July, but the Delta variant impacted several markets, resulting in a softer August, followed by improvement in September, as the variant began to lessen in some of our key markets. The pandemic continues to be a key factor across our operating environment, in addition to the ongoing pressure points in our supply chain. However, our network system is leveraging the learning's from the past 18 months, sharing best practices and skillfully executing by applying Revenue Growth Management, and working our supply chain leavers to capitalize on the strength of our brands and mitigate disruptions. The industry is growing and we continue to gain shares. Our overall value share improved year-on-year, and remains above 2019 levels. We're pleased to report gains across categories, as well as both within at home and away from home channels. Our operating units are combining the power of scale with a deep knowledge required to win locally in an environment that remains dynamic. So diving a little into the key drivers across geographies, starting with Asia-Pacific. In China, media investments across categories are yielding promising signs. Results in the quarter reflect strict COVID lockdowns and some weather-related disruption in August, while September marked sequential improvements. Japan state of emergency was lifted at the end of the quarter after consumers spent the majority of 2021 in lock-down. Strengthened execution across our teams and innovation has helped lessen impacts, and our consumer base has grown beyond 2019 levels. In India, we participated strongly in the recovery by focusing on affordability and omni -channel growth through e-B2B. We grew both trademark coke and local icon Thums-up using effective marketing activations. We had share gains in ASEAN and the South Pacific Operating Unit, despite pandemic-related restrictions in all of its top markets.  Our investments behind Sparkling flavors and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, will continue to create value when lock-downs are lifted.  In EMEA, in Europe, we gained value share across nearly all categories as restrictions eased, while weather, a slower recovery in tourism, and the delta surge had an impact on global campaigns to key brands including Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Sprite, and Fanta helped drive sparkling share. As vaccinations accelerated in Eurasia and the Middle East, we maintained momentum through effective revenue growth management initiatives, resulting in top-line that expanded faster than the macro environment in those top markets. Our results in Africa were balanced across regions and categories during this quarter, despite a third wave of the pandemic that resulted in targeted lockdowns. Vaccination rates remained on the low side relative to the rest of the world. And our focus remains on affordability and single-serve packs as mobility increases in countries like Egypt and Nigeria. We maintained strong momentum in North America despite the COVID resurgence in many states leading to stalling consumer sentiment and supply chain challenges that resulted in both missed opportunities and incremental costs. The at-home channel remains healthy, and although away-from-home growth accelerated early in the quarter, labor shortages have constrained capacity with some on-premise customers. Recent price actions to offset higher input costs have been effective with lower-than-expected price elasticities to date, and promotional levels remain below 2019.  In Latin America, successful commercial initiatives, including affordability packs, increased availability of our key products, and strong customer execution in both modern and traditional trade, drove volume growth across all major markets amidst an improving COVID environment. Improvement in single-serve mix, some pricing actions, and connecting brands strategies to on-premise customers to drive further recovery in the away-from-home channel all contributed to strong price mix. Within Global Ventures, Costa benefited from retail store recovery as the UK re-opens. With improved reach and frequency from its enhanced loyalty program Costa continues to expand across platforms into new markets in partnership with our bottlers, resulting in growing brand awareness. Our Bottling Investments Group performance was driven by India and the Philippines. BIG saw strict lockdowns in several markets, as well as rising inflation, but has continued to see share gains year-to-date in South Africa. Adverse impacts have been well-managed through package and category mix improvements along with cost controls preserving progress on our operating margins during the pandemic. Global category teams are working with our operating units to build an engine to drive effective marketing scale and innovation, which we amplified across the world. Highlights from this quarter include Coca-Cola Zero Sugar\u2019s new recipe has rolled out in more than 50 countries and has had accelerated growth in the last 3 months. In September, trademark Coca-Cola\u2019s new global brand philosophy Real Magic was unveiled featuring a refreshed look for our iconic logo, the Hug. The Real Magic platform takes a digital first approach and our executions feature a range of experiences that are tailored to Gen Z and leverage passion points like gaming and music to attract a new generation of drinkers. Sparkling flavors gained share in the quarter driven by investments in targeted brand country combinations with a focus on occasions and Zero Sugar offerings. In China, Sprite volume growth was accelerated by leveraging the global Let\u2019s Be Clear campaign during summer music festivals. Similarly, the 'What The Fanta' campaign focuses on snacking, and is driving growth across all key metrics in Europe. The hydration, sports, tea and coffee categories are seeing a good return on spend behind global brands. AHA\u2019s expansion into new markets this year, has shown flexibility to adapt to local customer and consumer needs. In Advanced hydration, functional benefits have helped to stretch brand power and drive share for Aquarius, as it becomes more of a global brand. Tea and coffee have had success with FUZE tea in Europe on both Ayataka and Costa, ready-to-drink in Japan. There is an opportunity to recover share in Georgia coffee as the at work occasion returns. Our juice portfolio gained share this quarter helped by Minute Maid Pulpy performance in China, Del Valle via growth in Latin America, and strong results across brands in Africa. In dairy, Fairlife is set to become the first billion dollar brand in our dairy portfolio and has recently launched its joint venture in China. Our experimentation with Topo Chico Hard Seltzer is expanding and we're gathering valuable insights globally, including the importance of building the category in regions where it is nascent. We are seeing encouraging performance where the flavored alcoholic beverage category is growing rapidly, and we have on-shelf presence. Molson Coors recently announced the national roll out of Topo Chico Hard Seltzer in the U.S. with new Margarita flavors. We also recently announced an expansion of our relationship with Molson Coors to bring the brand into Canada. As the pandemic recovery has progressed, we've seen challenges and disruptions in many parts of the world, in addition to inflationary forces that could persist. We have years of experience in dealing with these types of environments, and are enhancing our strong capabilities that enable us to do so. We are using the crucial tool of Revenue Growth Management in its many forms, and are executing in collaboration with our bottling partners. We continue to refine our ability to optimize price and package offerings, according to occasions, brands, and channels, striking the right balance between premiumization and affordability. In addition to streamlining our portfolio, targeting more disciplined innovation, intelligent experimentation, and transforming our marketing model, we're also building strong digital capabilities. We have taken an enterprise approach and are progressing on the roll out of multi-category Ebb3 platforms with our bottlers globally. As an example [Indiscernible] is seeing strong growth outside home market of Latin America, and that's more than 50 categories contributing meaningfully to it's sales on the platform. Additionally, we are delivering outsized growth with powerful, and growing omni -channel presence across regions. We're driving incremental instance with partners like foodservice aggregators. North America, for example, has grown attachment rates by mid single-digits with third-party and restaurant owned platforms. And we're gaining share in e-commerce, with significant wins in Eurasia and hitting record levels in Latin America this quarter. I'll also like to reiterate the sustainability is an integral part of our business strategy and it's a key driver of future growth. For 2018 when we launched World Without Waste to today, we've made much progress against our pillars to design, collect, and partner to deliver against our goals. Our commitment to reduce waste globally is also closely connected to our climate ambitions, collecting more empty packages, using more recycled material, light-weighting our bottles, and using plant-based materials always we are embracing the collective efforts to decarbonize the global economy. We strive to provide stakeholders with clear progress against our goals through our annual business in ESG report and World Without Waste report, including using the Global Reporting Initiative, SASB, and TCFD reporting frameworks, as well as disclosures through other publicly available avenues like CDP and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. We continuously revisit our ESG reporting and disclosures to ensure our leadership position. We do not take our responsibility lightly, and we carefully and thoroughly [Indiscernible] long-term objectives with our system partners, and only commit to new goals with a clear, actionable plan. To ensure we remain transparent on responses to this evolving landscape, we'd like to invite you to join us for our virtual ESG event on November the 3rd, where key business and sustainability leaders will provide an update on our initiatives, and answer your questions. As we look at our year-to-date performances in the system, it's clear that we are emerging stronger from the pandemic, delivering solid results under more network structure. Now, I'll turn the call to John, to discuss our third quarter results, our updated outlook, and some initial thoughts about 2022.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you [Indiscernible]. in the third quarter, we delivered another set of strong results, building on the momentum we've seen this year. Our Q3 organic revenue was up 14% with concentrate shipments up 8% on price mix of 6%, price mix was led by strong pricing in North America and Latin America and further improvement in away-from-home channels in many markets. Unit case growth was 6%, with absolute unit cases ahead of 2019 levels for the first time this year, and a sequential improvement versus the second quarter on a 2 year basis. Concentrate shipments outpaced unit cases in the quarter due to inventory builds by some of our bottling partners to manage through near-term disruption. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 160 basis points versus prior year, driven by pricing in the market, positive mix, and timing of shipments. Despite some pressure points in the supply chain, we're successfully pulling the levers at our disposal to mitigate impacts to the best of our ability. We continue to invest as many markets reopen during the quarter and significantly stepped up our marketing dollar versus prior year. As a result, our comparable operating margin compressed by 40 basis points year-over-year more than offsetting the flow through from the strong top line. Below operating income, we saw some leverage come through from the other income line and a lower tax rate for the quarter that was driven by our updated effective tax rate for the full year to 18.6% from 19.1% previously. Putting all this together, third quarter comparable earnings per share of $0.65 was an increase of 18% year-over-year, including a 3 point benefit from currency. We also delivered strong year-to-date free cash flow of $8.5 billion. Given our strong results and with 1 quarter remaining, we have good visibility and are raising guidance for the full year. We now expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 13% to 14%, which is at the high end of our previously provided range, and comparable EPS growth of 15% to 17% in 2021. Our updated guidance for free cash flow of approximately $10.5 billion represents significant progress over the past few years, and particularly during the COVID era. This progress is further dimensionalize as follows: We expect to achieve this year a dividend payout ratio below our long-term target of 75% of free cash flow for the first time since 2015. We anticipate delivering another year of free cash flow conversion above 100%. And finally, our expected free cash flow has almost doubled since 2017. Our improving cash flow position will allow us to be even more vigorous in pursuit of our capital allocation priorities. First and foremost, to invest in our business, secondly, continuing our track record to grow our dividend, thirdly, to seek opportune M&A, and finally, with excess cash to repurchase our shares. So as we think about Q4, a few things to keep in mind. 1, the recovery phase looks different around the world and we expect that to continue. 2, we continue to see a minimal commodity impact due to hedges we have in place for the remainder of the year. 3, from a marketing perspective, we expect to increase consumer-facing marketing spend toward levels similar to 2019 while improving the quality of that spend and allocating it in a more targeted manner. 4, our currency outlook continues to contemplate a tailwind of 1% to 2% to the top line, and approximately 2% to 3% to comparable EPS in 2021 based on current spot rates and our hedge positions. Last, but not least, our current full-year guidance has built in the leveling of our concentrate shipments that are running ahead year-to-date due to timing considering that we have 6 fewer days in the fourth quarter. It's not typical for us to provide commentary on the year ahead at this stage but I would like to highlight a few points regarding 2022 given the dynamics we are already seeing. While there are puts and takes to consider from the pandemic looking into next year, we're confident in the underlying top line trajectory supported by our transformation work, our innovation agenda, and a more efficient and effective approach to marketing. Along with this ongoing momentum in revenues, we also expect to see some higher costs. We are not immune to the commodity inflation that has been impacting the world for the better part of 2021 nor the rapidly changing environment. We've been successful with hedges that were put in place to mitigate the impact of input cost inflation and those will begin to roll off in 2022. Based on current rates and hedge position, we'd expect commodity inflation having mid-single-digit impact on our cost of goods sold in 2022. We've been proactively accelerating our revenue growth management, and productivity levers to offset some of this pressure as we look out to next year. And we're closely monitoring the moving parts in the supply chain to ensure we are well-positioned to meet demand. Moving to marketing dollars, we'll continue to invest purposefully in our brands and markets to support top-line growth, with spend more heavily weighted towards consumer-facing activities. Regarding currency, if we were to assume current rates and our hedge position, there would be an approximate 2 to 3 points currency headwind to revenue, and a 2 to 3 point headwind to earnings for the full year 2022. Of course, volatility remain and several factors could have an impact on our currency outlook between now and February. Overall, as vaccinations continue to progress globally, we are in a better position today to navigate this environment and we feel good about the potential for our business. We look forward to coming back with more specific guidance after the fourth quarter. In closing, I'd like to acknowledge the more than 700,000 men and women of the Coca-Cola system, whose tremendous dedication and hard work have been instrumental to delivering the strong results in the first nine months of the year. The alignment of our system and it's deft navigation through a challenging supply environment and an asynchronous pandemic recovery has been key enablers to emerging stronger. We're confident in our updated guidance and our ability to further leverage our strong capability to drive sustainable top-line growth and maximize returns. With that, Operator, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, to ask a question, [Operator Instructions]. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit your questions to 1 question. If you have any additional questions, you may rejoin the queue. Your first question is from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I appreciate the commentary on the cadence through the quarter and even giving us a little bit of some pieces to look at '22. But if we can just -- I think one of the questions we're getting now is just -- kind of the business momentum, maybe how it's come -- progressed as we move into the fourth quarter. So maybe if you could give a little bit more color on just, you know, how you're seeing the business currently. And also just some perspective on how you see that momentum going into '22 given, not just the pandemic, but also inflation and pricing -- just some context about how the businesses is going so far this quarter. But also just your perspective on that going into '22\nJames Quincey : Sure. Good morning, Bryan. Firstly, we clearly have been executing [Indiscernible] emerging stronger strategy. And you can see that coming through, we've called out that the third quarter was the first quarter to be growing versus -- in a full quarter versus 2019. So a sequential improvement, as we've been going through this year from the first half, which was below 2019 to the third quarter, which was above it. So it's clearly sequential improvement coming through as we have adapted our ability to cope with the ups and downs of the lockdowns and the re-openings. Now, in the quarter as you say, we called out that July started well, and then August was softer as there were more lock downs and then September was better. When you think about where that's going in the fourth quarter and into next year, clearly the fact that we have raised or clarified guidance on revenue to be the top end of the range should lead you to feel confident that we see visibility in the downhill of the rest of this year. October has started strong and in line with expectations so we feel good. The momentum is there. I've made the caveat, as many other people have done through COVID, that who knows what could happen in the downhill with variants and with lock downs. But at the moment what we see is the momentum is there, we feel good about our top-line guidance for the year and October backs up that statement. And then as it goes through 2022, obviously too early to call the full year next year, and we will do so in February. But again, in the comments, in the press release, in John's comments, we said we feel that we think we have momentum in the business. Again, the caveats of who knows what will happen with variance and potential lock downs but we do see the world emerging from the crisis a bit like an earthquake. You get more aftershocks, but the consequent aftershocks tend to be smaller than the early ones. And that's how we see '22. We feel there's good momentum and the strategy is working and it's getting us back on track.\nBryan Spillane: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks, Good morning. I wanted to just talk a little bit more maybe about supply chain. Last quarter, you talked about isolated pressure points and definitely offered commentary to say that you're able to tap into supplier relationships and so on. But I was just curious I guess, what's the thought that bottlers continue to try to build inventory, not just in advance of 4Q, but even looking into '22, that you kind of maintain this disconnect between them and concentrate shipments and unit case volume, but also to talk a little bit on the packaging side of things and what the system is able to do to have better access to the range of packaging options. Because I know things have been tight all year, but it sounds like they're getting worse. And so just curious what you could offer us on what you guys are doing to be able to manage through that so well, thanks.\nJames Quincey : I'm not sure I used with the word isolated last quarter, but I know what you mean. Look, firstly, we have a lot of capability of managing through crises. This may be a unique and global one, but most managers and leaders at Coke have, sometime in their career, managed a part of the world or a country that's gone through severe dislocation. And so we have built capability over the years to manage through this. And in the mean -- in particular, in the supply chains, organizations of the Company, and with the bottlers, And so we have strong capabilities, we look for long-term partnerships with the ecosystem of the supply chains, whether that's imports, materials, or logistics. We also act as a system in a number of regards. We have something called the Cross Enterprise Procurement Group, which buys key commodities on behalf of the Company and the bottlers, so there's a great deal of coordination between ourselves and the bottlers. In terms of the problems it's a bit like whack-a-mole, things pop up. We've talked previously about can pressure in the U.S. self-evidently, there's issues in shipping and freight and availability of labor in places, then you get one that pops up. The price of gas spikes in Europe, and the availability of CO2 comes under pressure. There's a PET plant went offline because it burst into flames in Brazil, etc. So there is a heightened degree of sporadic problems appearing, as well as kind of structural shortages of certain ingredients. But we have global scale, we have global coordination, and we have long-term relationships with many of our ecosystem partners that are allowing us to manage and offset what's going on.  Now, as regards the bottler inventory towards the end of the year, clearly we are working with the bottlers and obviously they can have the comfort and the assurance that they don't necessarily need to hold it in their hands for us to be certain of having it as a system. We obviously ourselves, being the key player in providing the contract, make sure we have enough buffered availability of ingredients and concentrate to make sure the bottlers are going to be in a good position, and we manage that accordingly with them in every year and particularly this one.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, guys. The thoughts around top line and volume recovery, you mentioned earlier for 2022 were helpful. Can you spend a bit more time discussing the pricing environment that you're seeing also in the U.S., other developed markets, and then in the developing markets? Obviously we're seeing a pretty unique spike in commodity costs in terms of the magnitude. So how is your system approaching pricing in this environment given that unique level of increase? And specifically for Coca-Cola itself, is the expectation that pricing can generally fully offset commodity increases on a dollar - for -dollar basis ex any demand elasticity secondary impact given you don't have as much commodity exposure as the entire system but share in the retail pricing moves. And then also maybe can you just detail the competitive pricing environment you're seeing from your key competitors. Thanks.\nJames Quincey : I'm pretty sure that adds up to more than one question, but I'll give it a go, Dara.\nDara Mohsenian: Multipart?\nJames Quincey : Yes, multipart. First point, we, as a matter of course, I mean, there's inflation every year. But we approach it from the point-of-view going. Our brands need to earn the right to adjust their prices each year, whether that be because of the marketing, the innovation, the execution, the investment in the marketplace, or the pressure on COGS, or the pressure on labor inflation. So as you can see from our numbers, I mean, we are pulling all the levers of price, mix, and marketing innovation each and every year. And so that is the starting point as we think forward into 2022.  Secondly, we see the environment of pricing, example the U.S. and largely everywhere else as pretty rational whether that'd be what competitors are doing or what the retailers are doing with their own label brands. And so we see our approach as earning the rights to take the price that creates value for ourselves, the system, and creates value for the retailers and creates value for the consumers. And that's our starting point. Yes, we did take an off-cycle increase in the U.S. Obviously slightly different by brand and by pack, but certainly in the high-single-digits, starting in August, the elasticity is perhaps a little better than they were last time. You may remember that whatever it was, 4 or 5 years ago, we took an off-cycle price increase in the U.S. when there was a very strong adjustments in the logistics market in the U.S. that caused everyone a great deal of problems. And so we passed that through this time, and we will be looking exactly what level our pricing needs to be for 2022. But again, the COGS input -- the COGS push through is a piece of the puzzle. And we certainly intend to earn the right to take the pricing for the brands and the packaging [Indiscernible]. That is true in other parts of the world. Obviously depending -- in the emerging markets on the level inflation in the marketplace, you got some double-digit inflation places where there might be more than one price increase during the year. But in the other developed markets, again, you see this approach of earning the right to take the price based on the brand, the pack, the occasion, the channel, and really driving that through.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Steve Powers with the Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Hey, thanks and good morning. Maybe pivoting back to the volume for a minute. You mentioned obviously that 3 volumes finished ahead of 19 for the first time since the pandemic started which is obviously a happy achievement. I guess what I'm wondering is there's a way to frame where 3Q volumes finished index to 19 in terms of at-home versus away from home or future consumption versus the media consumption. I guess I'm trying to get a better sense conceptually of how much further runway there may be in the away-from-home --. I mean, the consumption side of the business recovering, which obviously has both volume implications but also beneficial price mix implications. Is there a right way to frame -- a right way to think about that from your perspective?\nJames Quincey : Yeah, sure. I'd say look, Q3 is above 2019 in volume. If I look at the mix of the business between away-from-home, and at-home, the at -- the away-from-home has not yet recovered to the same share of mix that it was in 2019. And so of course, implicit in your question is that a tailwind going forward as more of the away-from-home recovers because of either the package or the brand or the occasion that is related to and then -- excuse me. The answer in some extensive is yes. Now, worth bearing in mind, but it's not a snap back, which is what you are seeing. It's not just a function of lock down and when the lock down ends the away from home comes back. I think we are seeing an evolution of the landscape. You're going to see some -- of course, away-from-home is a series of a whole set of sub-channels. You're going to see some of those sub-channels -- well actually, over the last two years -- almost two years now, there's been a reduction in the number of outlets. And so our hypothesis is it will take time to see those outlets re-expand, reappear. And so, just because the lockdown end doesn't mean the outlet reappears. So we will see some of that. But of course there will be some channels that are not yet fully opened. Much of travel and kind of hospitality, there are whole series of sub-channels that are still running far below their 2019 levels. So yes, it's a headwind -- it's a tailwind going into the future, but it's not dependent just on the end of lock-downs. And I think -- well if you imagine a curve, we've got -- the snap-back has happened, and now it's going to be a little more of a smoothing of the curve to recover the rest of the away-from-home, because in part people's habits have changed. Like I said, it's an evolving landscape, I mean, what degree of more permanent at homework here are we going to see. Not quite clear. So I think we've got a big piece of it, let's say half of it back, of the mix, and there's another half to come, but it won't come overnight, it will come over time.\nSteve Powers: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Market.\nNik Modi: Good morning, everyone. James, I was hoping you can give us an update on the [Indiscernible] and all the changes that were made. Do you have all the right people in the right seats now? And how is the organization adjusting to the new decision-making matrix if you could just provide us an update there? Just some of the feedback that I've gotten is that you are still in bulk being worked out, so I'm just trying to get a better understanding of timing on when you think you'll be optimally running under this new network structure.\nJames Quincey : I'm not sure I would ever call it arriving at the destination off to be optimally running because by the time we get there, something else will have changed in the world and we'll need to make some tweaks and evolve. Certainly we stood up the organization in the first quarter and then it was off to a good start. It's very much on track with our expectations. As you say, one would expect that the recent bumps and some kings that need to be worked out and that is what we're going through at the moment. And it's not that all of the change has happened yet. We've been running [Indiscernible] and the marketing team have been running a big agency review through this year. We're coming up on the final decisions on that in the fourth quarter, which will start bringing a structural amount of change next year in the way we interact in our marketing the enabling spend ecosystem. They'll be more change and we will continue to that. So we are focused on working out the bumps and the bits we've already listed up. We'll be bringing more change in terms of how we get the marketing sorted out next year. And I'm sure things will happen in the marketplace that will cause us to want to make further revolutions. But we certainly see that the early signs of how the new organizational model could help us both deal and manage through the crisis, whether it's what we've done on the supply chain or the procurement, but also set us up Ultimately, this is all about being an enabler to give us confidence in driving and delivering on our long-term growth algorithm.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was actually hoping you guys could talk about whether or not you have a competitive advantage during a period of rising input and transportation costs relative to your peers, given your asset-light or asset-right, refranchise model. I guess I'm thinking about this in context of your preliminary outlook for FY '22 as it relates to COGS pressures and then, curious to hear, I guess, how you're working with your bottlers who really are experiencing pretty sharp cost pressures to essentially help them navigate through this tough environment. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yeah. Let me start with the system and then work back towards the Company. Obviously, we're working with the bottlers on a collective basis, and an individual and country basis. And I draw the distinction because, on a collective basis, as I mentioned earlier, we have a unit called the Cross Enterprise Procurement Group, which works on behalf the system globally and also the major bottles to procure the key input costs, whether it be resin, aluminum, sweetness, whatever it would happen to be. And that's not just about buying, it's about the hedges, and the pricing and the security of supply. So there is a tremendous activity in coordination with the bottlers on the principal input costs. Then, of course, we work locally with the bottlers is in the countries taking into account all the other factors that go into how we might want to approach pricing whether that's the other costs, the more local costs, logistics, labor, etc. and our agenda for marketing and innovation and execution in our GM and come up with a plan to make sure that we drive that into the marketplace and into the brands or in the right for the pricing that keeps them attractive to the retailers, attractive to the consumers, and drives the business for us. And then obviously within that, the Company itself has a skew to certain ingredients. Because we are asset-light, we are more certain businesses, like the juice business, vertically integrated in the U.S. and with [Indiscernible] in Europe, than necessarily aluminum. So we do have an exposure for costs, which is why we pulled out what we pulled out. I think that competitive advantage is not whether the Company necessarily is asset-light or not, or how only certain commodities we -- ultimately, we're a system with our bottlers where the pricing is taken by the bottler, and then the Company follows that along. I think the advantage is the global scale, the experience in managing through these environments, and the ability to work with the supply ecosystem and create value for the retailers and the consumers.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. That makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hey, everybody, good morning. Can I please follow up on Bonnie's question as it relates to the incidence pricing model and maybe some of the new models that we're putting in recent years? How does it work in this environment? Because the pricing is, of course, still taken by the bottlers, but I guess the relative price inflation -- the relative cost inflation is much higher at the bottler than it might be for yourselves. I understand that you take it as a system, but how does that work from an incidence pricing perspective? Does it still hold in that you were able to follow on wherever the bottler does in the marketplace or are there tweaks being made for what right now seems to be a bit of an abnormal situation?\nJames Quincey : No, the incidence model works as the incidence model, which to be clear is generally speaking, that the Company's revenue on any particular brand or package is a percent of what the bottler is getting, it's not the same percent necessarily on every brand or even every package. But it is a percent. And then all the time this has proven to be a great way of maintaining alignment and shared interest in driving value for the Company and the bottlers local management. When a brand or a package or a channel or occasion grows, it's good for both the bottler and the Company, and if we decide to push on something that's more affordable, it delivers less for the bottler and the Company. So the incidence is proven to be a tremendous vehicle of getting the franchise system to focus on creating value in the marketplace. Overtime in certain environments it puts -- the rest of the cost structure puts a little more pressure on the bottler or a little more pressure on the Company depending on what's going on. But we don't course -- micro course correct the incidence for small problems or in potentially medium problems. We look at a holistic view of making sure the bottling system is structurally sound, is -- has got the right capabilities, the right ownership, and the right capacity to invest in the marketplace. So it's something completely pushes the thing on -- off track. We're in a different situation. Otherwise, we and the bottlers don't manage for the short term. We do manage the short-term, but we think about it in the context of where we're going long term and manage through short-term effects.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Andrea Teixeira with the J.P. Morgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. James, I wanted to go back to your pricing commentary. If you can talk to your ability to continue to take pricing, or if the actions you took so far, including the one you alluded to in North America in August, will suffice to mitigate the additional mid-single-digit cost pressures in 2022. And how do you see the balance in between bringing back promotions to historical levels into 2022 for the at-home consumption. Thank you.\nJames Quincey : Thanks for that. Obviously, we're not at the stage of providing an outlook on pricing and promotion levels in 2022. We'll do that when we get to February. Certainly what we did in North America address the immediate 2021 issues in North America as we did in other parts of the world. Wherever it was in the world, we would have addressed the cost issues and the brand pricing issues wherever we were. Again, I think the important thing -- the pricing approach is to own the rights, to take the pricing for the brand. They own that -- their equity owns the right of pricing and that's the combination of bearing in mind the cost inflation -- the input cost inflation, the labor costs, the logistics costs, what we need to invest in marketing, what we need to invest in innovation, what we need to invest in execution, and what we need to invest in Cola's and routes-to-market are not all goals in to the equation of taking the pricing that we have earned to take. And that is the same balancing equation that we will look at for 2022.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Carlos Laboy with HSBC.\nCarlos Laboy: Yes. Good morning, everyone. James, you mentioned strong U.S. pricing several times and in our southwestern and in U.S. markets more recently, we also saw a major step-up in revenue management execution from pre -pandemic levels. It's really sophisticated price pack structures that we're seeing. Can you give us a more broad-based North American assessment of how you see the market development capability of the U.S. system improving over the next couple of years? I guess, what does the system going to be doing differently to keep driving this market development capability forward?\nJames Quincey : Yeah, sure. Well, thank you for those observations, Carlos, on the -- resuming taxes or something like that. As you as you well know, as a long-term reserve of Latin America, we certainly have been trying to fuse together what the best of what the U.S. system does with some important thinking from Latin America on our GM, and on the ground up and down the street execution. As we look forward into the U.S. clearly we're trying to bring a combination of more investment in the marketing of brands, more innovation targeted to the marketplace. That with the increasing use of RGM to be more sophisticated in the price and the mix opportunity, but also back with ongoing improvements in the execution capability, not just in the larger stores or with the larger away-from-home partners, but also up and down the street with the small stores. And really being within an arm's reach desire not just, perhaps, an arm's reach of job, but within a clicks reach of desire, and I think the system is continuing to backdrop as we go forward.\nCarlos Laboy: Thank you.\nJames Quincey : Sure.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.\nRob Ottenstein: Yes. Thank you very much. First, just a quick point of clarification. If you could give the breakout of price mix in LATAM how much was price mix and channel. And then my more substantive question, some really great progress on the free cash flow side, significantly higher than your initial guidance. Can you talk about some of the drivers there? Are you where you need to be in terms of cash conversion at this point? And are these levels sustainable? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I'll do the free -- I'll do the price mix, and then John can take the flowers and the lowers on doubling the free cash flow in the last few years. Price mix in Latin America, clearly there is a big component of rate in the third quarter, and part of that is driven by inflationary pricing in Argentina. But in the quarter channel and price mix -- sorry. Channel and package were both positive to mix as was the timing of some of the deductions. And so yes, it is, Rob, normally. I think particularly in the [Indiscernible] -- I mean, it is generally true for the Company that don't over-rotate the quarterly pricing, particularly in emerging markets, where they can be a tremendous amount of volatility because obviously, we're quite far back in supply chain. So I would encourage looking at places like Latin America on a more multi-quarter basis, given the volatility that one can get in terms of a price for mix, given where we are in terms of what ships where, but generally speaking, there's a mainly operational price mix and then there's a little piece that's inflation in Argentina. John?\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, James. On the free cash flow, clearly pleased with the progress we've made, looking forward a couple of observations on our free cash flow conversion. Our long-term algorithm has free cash flow conversion of 90% to 95% range. And I still believe that's the right level for us to be pitching us. This year is better than that. And due to some specific items through the year, our marketing accruals in '21 were much higher than '20 as the marketing spend returns to 2019 levels. Our incentive compensation was down for obvious reasons in 2020 due to the pandemic impact. We -- as I mentioned on the call earlier, we anticipate some headwinds on Forex going into '22. Taking all that into account, I would expect us to be still able to deliver against the range that we've outlined in the long-term algorithm. Some of the drivers, Robert, in the last couple of years, we've made a lot of progress on working capital. We've talked about that in the past. We continue to do so in a strange way, the one area that we are below how I would like to be is on inventory, but in a paradoxical where that's been actually a good thing to have more buffer around the world. And so in the immediate short-term, I like it that way. But it's an area that we will continue to attack over time. In a number of areas.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Sean King with UBS.\nSean King: Thanks for the question. I'd like to get your thoughts and some of the puts and takes to your bottling systems, DSD capabilities in the context of some of the pressure points that other CPGs are having and keeping store shelves stocked, particularly around the coming holiday season. Is it safe to say you maybe absorbing some higher costs, or the potential for share gains?\nJames Quincey : Clearly there's some pressure in the marketplace in terms of logistical capacity. And obviously with the holiday season tending to see demand go up, that's going to come into shop or focus as we go into the next few months. We are well set up, I think we are advantaged competitively. I would like to see us, as you say, make gains in not just the share of the visible inventory, but in the share of the sell-out as well. We will see some of that is limited by some of the supply constraints. If we want to talk about the U.S., it's still tight on cans, it's still tight on hot-filled resin. And so there is some limitations to what's coming out there but clearly, as we sell lots of different brands in lots of different packages, we have the opportunity to make sure we can get the shelves full, if not with absolutely everything we'd love to see on the shelves, at least the shelves will be full with the vast majority of the things we would like to see on the shelves and we can manage through it. If there's tremendous demand and shortage in supply across, one logically starts to wonder whether you need all the promotions that one can think of. So there is a balancing of if it costs slightly more to get stuff there because there are shortages, then you don't need as much promotion. So I think there is a lot -- there are a set of puts and takes here which will allow us -- the system to have a good holiday season.\nSean King: Great. Thank you.\nJames Quincey : Sure.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning. I just want to follow up on this outlook for mid-single digit inflation going into next year. Conceptually spot prices are decidedly higher than mid-single-digits. Perhaps I'm reading that dynamic wrong. But if I'm not, is it simply a function of your global scale, your ability to source [Indiscernible] better rates prevailing? You just noted that inventory has been training on free cash flow, but that's actually a buffer, which has helped you actually in this tight inventory position. I guess any perspective around that would be helpful because this is a dynamic we've been seeing where spot is actually quite a bit worse than how companies are looking at the go-forward and I'm just curious on perhaps why that is the case and why you might stand out in this regard. Thanks so much.\nJames Quincey : Yeah, 2 things to bear in mind. Let me start with the Company and talk about the total system. We the Company obviously skew, as I mentioned earlier, in terms of the commodities that flow through our P&L most directly. And bear in mind, the biggest commodity that flows through the Company's P&L is actually juice -- the cost of buying of juice, whose spot price has not shot up. It was not projected to shoot up as much next year as this year. That has obviously increased in '21 over '20. But it's looking more in the range that we've talked about going into 2022. So from the Company's perspective, our biggest commodity is not what the spot price of it for next year. It's not wildly projected to be out of line with what we're talking about in terms of increases. Then obviously we bought -- we buy a whole set of other things, which are expected to go up. So I do want to also encourage you to remember that we don't buy heavily on spot. That is not our objective. As I told earlier, we given our scale in most commodities, especially the system, we look to buy on a long-term basis, not just hedging on a long-term basis or a multi-quarter basis, but buying with partners and making commitments on a long-term basis too. And so we don't go up and down with the stock market on a day-to-day basis. And that means that the system also has the ability to lock-in while still inflation rate in 2022, whether we're talking about PET or metals, or sugars, or corn syrup. They're all going up in 2022, but if not, the sky is falling.\nChris Carey: Okay. Thanks so much.\nJames Quincey: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question or final question is from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone and congratulations on further progress in the quarter. James, I want to pivot to the energy drink category and your broader strategy there as performance energy brands have accelerated industry growth and taking share from brands like Monster. Clearly your stake in Monster underpins the Company's broader strategy though you've also obviously rolled out Coke Energy, AHA with caffeine, you're rolling out Costa RTD coffees in certain markets. I'd like to get your updated thoughts on, 1, how the category is evolving, and, 2, your overall level of satisfaction with your energy drink strategy, particularly some of the niche and upcoming brands that are gaining market share from brands like Monster. Thank you.\nJames Quincey : Yes, sure. Let me distinguish clearly between the energy drink category and the energy or recharge need stake, as you mentioned the series of other brands as well. As it relates to the energy drink category, obviously, we have a very successful partnership with Monster that has created tremendous value for us, for the bottlers, and in particular, for Monster. And I think that's driven the losses. Yes, there have been in the U.S. some recent competitive entries, which seem to be both expanding the category and taking some share. Obviously, you can -- you see in their numbers, I know they haven't announced it this quarter, but at least for the numbers they've announced for the first half so far this year, you can see they continue to grow strongly this year on top of growing last year, so there's a lot of success and I'm sure they will talk about on their call how they're responding to marketplace dynamics. And obviously, we, the system, look forward to continuing to drive success with that partnership. As it relates to the broader energy needs state or recharge needs state of consumers, Clearly, that's growing. It has been growing pre - Covid, and it's still growing whether that be, as you say, ready-to-drink coffees or some of the caffeinated waters, we see a lot of focus and an opportunity for growth there. Ready -- Costa Ready-to-Drink has done well where we've launched it. AHA has done well in the launch in China. Certainly there's caffeine being introduced to a number of different beverages here in the U.S. And so we do see ultimately the recharge needs [Indiscernible]. Whether that's satisfied with an energy drink or Coke Classic or AHA with caffeine or a Fair like chocolate milk shake that has been a long-term driver of growth in the beverage industry and we expect it to remain so.\nKevin Grundy: Very good. Thank you.\nJames Quincey : You're welcome. Okay. I think that was the last question. So to summarize, we're confident that as the world begins to move beyond the pandemic, we'll deliver against our long-term growth model consistently and sustainably over time. And I'm putting our new marketing model interaction to shaping a strong and enduring innovation pipeline from our digital initiatives to our important sustainability agenda. We are working in alignment with our bottling partners, with the power of our people and we're poised to drive growth at scale for the entire system for years to come. So thank you for your interest, your investment in our Company, and for joining us this morning. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

Please limit yourself to one question and if you have more than one, please ask your most pressing ones first and then reenter the queue. Now, let me turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, thanks to the tremendous efforts by our associates and our bottling partners, we executed on our key emerging stronger priorities, as many parts of the world gradually reopened. As we continued to deliver on our transformation, we are encouraged by our results and are raising our top line, bottom line and cash flow guidance, even as we are accelerating investments for the future. At the same time, we also recognize the trajectory may be dynamic and understand that we must remain flexible to respond to changes in the environment. This morning, I\u2019ll provide a business update and discuss how disciplined innovation and more effective and efficient marketing are driving broad-based share gains and are delivering enhanced value for our system. Then I will hand the call over to John to discuss our financial update, including our improved outlook for the year. Last year, in the face of a global pandemic, we laid out a path to emerge stronger across five strategic priorities. We are delivering against those priorities and this quarter demonstrates the power of our system. We started 2021 with promising results. Mobility and business levels improved in the first quarter and this trend continued in the second. Consumer mobility increased in markets where vaccination rates are reaching meaningful levels and our business has recovered as we\u2019re lapping last year\u2019s biggest lockdown impacts and see our strategies in motion. Consumers have started to return to many prior routine. And as a result, our away-from-home volumes steadily improved as a percent of our business this quarter, driving strong price/mix and margin acceleration across the enterprise. However, the recovery remains asynchronous and several parts of the world have dealt with further wave of infections leading to delayed openings, and in some cases, tightened restrictions. India and Southeast Asia were our only areas that did not see sequential volume acceleration on a two-year basis this quarter. Despite the asynchronous recovery, our revenues and earnings in the second quarter surpassed our 2019 results. We also made progress on share this quarter. We said many times that gaining share is a key objective in our emerging stronger agenda. And I am pleased to report that we have achieved that objective with broad-based share gains across categories, as well as in both our at-home and away-from-home channels in the quarter. And importantly, despite away-from-home channels not having fully recovered, our value share today is higher than the 2019 levels, confirming that our effective brand building and innovation, along with our advanced revenue growth management and market execution capabilities, are working. So let me dive a bit deeper into the key drivers across our geographies. In Asia-Pacific, China saw continued momentum across categories, driven by both volume and improved mix with Trademark Coca-Cola. We outpaced the overall macroeconomic recovery, led by strong performance in away-from-home channels and business-to-consumer e-commerce. Australia and New Zealand were bright spots, performing at or close to 2019 levels, but they are currently seeing renewed lockdowns. While Japan is struggling to come out of lockdown, there have been tangible successes with consumer-led innovation, small pack initiatives and improved customer execution of key initiatives. As I mentioned earlier, in India and across much of Southeast Asia, resurgence in the virus impacted further recovery. As India\u2019s restrictions have eased a bit, we are encouraged by the level of resilience in both the business, as well as our system associates as they have navigated this resurgence. In EMEA, Europe is still being impacted by some level of restriction, but vaccination rates and consumer confidence are improving. Because of this and our strong bottle alignment and marketing investment, we are seeing a much improved away-from-home mix even as at-home volumes continue to grow. Great Britain and Russia, where mobility was at the highest, show noticeable volume outperformance relative to 2019, and sparkling soft drinks gained or maintained share in most of the top 10 markets in Europe. Eurasia and the Middle East are performing well despite a diverse recovery landscape. In Turkey and Pakistan, strong execution during the key Ramadan holiday and emphasis on snacking and meal occasions drove new consumers to the Coke brands. Africa delivered a strong first half performance with affordability packages delivering good results, despite tightened restrictions heading into the winter season and vaccination rates that are behind the rest of the world. In North America, the consumer environment improved through the quarter as many states lifted restrictions and consumer mobility increased. More frequent social gatherings and rising travel and event activity drove significantly higher demand for our brands in away-from-home channels, while at-home volumes remained robust, leading to broad-based share gains in the quarter. Within away-from-home, eating and drinking was the strongest performing channel, with travel, hospitality and at-work trailing. In Latin America, lockdowns eased as vaccination programs rolled out in countries such as Mexico and Argentina, and stimulus programs in Brazil and Chile also helped drive recovery. Our results and year-to-date share gains in the region continued to be driven by commercial initiatives to improve execution, as well as a focus on affordable packs like refillables. Costa\u2019s UK Coffee Shop revenues recovered almost entirely to 2019 levels through the reopening phase, despite ongoing capacity restrictions. Increased consumer traffic and digital momentum are also supporting recovery as restrictions eased in other countries where we have a retail presence. Our Bottling Investment Group faced pandemic-related challenges, particularly in India and Southeast Asia, but managed to sequentially improve or gain share in India, Vietnam, the Philippines and South Africa. BIG also made great progress against this growth and productivity agenda, increasing year-to-date comparable operating margin approximately 300 basis points from the 2019 levels. Our category teams are collaborating with a global lens, enabling us to move even faster towards our Beverages for Life ambition. By continuously engaging consumers around their passion points and testing ideas in a coordinated and increasingly digital way, we are getting even better at what we\u2019ve always done best, building loved brands around the world. For a few examples, the Coke trademark portfolio is experiencing robust growth, led by brand Coke and driven in part by Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, which has contributed double-digit growth in value and volume year-to-date. The new Coca-Cola Zero Sugar recipe has already launched in nearly 50 markets across six of our operating units, including last week\u2019s announcement in the U.S., with more to come this year. Early results indicate that the recipe and simplified packaging design are resonating strongly with consumers. In sparkling flavors, we are accelerating our Zero Sugar offerings and executing global campaigns to focus on key occasions. Sprite has done well globally, benefiting from the Let\u2019s Be Clear campaign, which has led to improved share gains. Likewise, I Want The Fanta Mystery Flavor campaign in Europe drove accelerated growth and improved share. Dairy remains an opportunity for the overall portfolio, with premium offerings in key brands like Hollandia drinkable yogurt and Fanta Cladius [ph] flavored milk showing healthy growth. We continue to leverage fairlife\u2019s great success in the U.S. with a recent expansion in Canada. There are many bright spots in hydration, sports, tea and coffee. We see momentum across brands in the U.S., including good results from our renewed focus on smartwater, a new brand bundle from Gold Peak tea, exciting flavor innovations in Dunkin Coffee and continued growth from expanded distribution of Topo Chico sparkling mineral water. We had early success with Costa ready-to-drink launches in Asia, with meaningful share gains in key markets in China and has already voted a hit product in Japan. The rapid consumer traction and attractive proposition of healthy indulgence AHA, which began as an intelligent local experiment in the U.S. led us to believe we can transition to be a bigger bet and travel internationally. The recent launch in China with the local name of Little Universe has been encouraging, with meaningful value share gains in a short period of time. We continued to build our momentum with the launch of AHA\u2019s first 360-degree marketing campaign with a significant digital emphasis titled Can I get an AHA? Finally, last summer we announced more exploration in the dynamic flavored alcoholic beverage category with the launch of Topo Chico Hard Seltzer. Topo Chico Hard Seltzer is now in 17 markets worldwide and we have authorized Molson Coors the right to produce and sell Topo Chico Hard Seltzer in the United States. Launching a global brand in markets where the categories are at different stages of development comes with many learning and our local knowledge allows us to adapt with speed-to-win or in some cases develop this new category. From strong performance in Europe where available, to top two position in Mexico, to the U.S. where velocity is robust and the products has enjoyed positive consumer reaction, we are encouraged by recent trends and are gaining valuable insights along the way. We continued to make progress with our consumer-facing digital propositions. Internally, we are building out our platform services organization to support the enterprise as we have a sizable opportunity to become a holistic digital leader. Digital is of the utmost importance and we are also building an integrated ecosystem of platforms that create value across the digital and physical worlds. We are partnering with our bottlers to leverage the power of systems\u2019 physical footprints online, creating enhanced value for customers across the globe for a best-in-class e-B2B platform. With pockets of excellence in many regions, we are working with our bottling partners to evolve and streamline our approach. Working together as a system allows us to improve distribution economics, solve unmet needs of outlet owners and opens new revenue streams by providing other CPG brands access to our deep customer relationships and global distribution network. We are building a digital one-stop shop for customers, seamlessly offering most of the products they need to stock their shelves and operate their daily business. We are also ensuring consumers get the frictionless experience they demand, with more availability and assortment of the products they need and love. On top of the initiatives discussed today, we also continued to work with our bottlers to embed RGM principles and integrate execution capabilities into our processes to continue driving basket value and incidents as the world reopens. Through enhanced execution, we have an opportunity to win with more consumers and grow share by having the right products, in the right channel, at the right price, supported by the right activations. We also continue with our sustainability agenda to create shared value for our stakeholders and communities we serve. In addition to integrating ESG considerations into our daily business decisions, during the second quarter, we released our business and ESG report, highlighting progress across all our goals, as well as our World Without Waste report, which focuses exclusively on our work to create a circular economy for our packaging materials. Highlights include the continued rollout of 100% recycled PET with 30 markets representing approximately 30% of our total sales offering at least one brand in 100% rPET packaging. We have continued the expansion of refillables and dispense packaging and ultra-light weighting technologies, and we delivered a 60% global collection rate for packaging in 2020. We are proud of these achievements and we know there is more work to be done. Recently, we announced we have become a global implementation partner for the Ocean Cleanup\u2019s River Project supporting the deployment of clean-up systems across 15 rivers across the world. We will embed our marketing capabilities into this partnership to create consumer awareness of the issues and the actions we are all taking. Putting it all together, we realize there\u2019s a range of possible outcomes when it comes to the pandemic in the second half of the year given the asynchronous recovery. While we over-delivered relative to our expectations in the first half and have raised guidance for 2021, we are biased towards a growth mentality and will invest behind this momentum going into the rest of the year. Our networked organization is beginning to help us move faster to capture opportunities and create value for our stakeholders. As a system, we are increasingly equipped to win, and we are excited about the future.  Now, I will turn the call over to John to discuss our second quarter results and the drivers of our updated outlook.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James. This morning, I will highlight the drivers of our second quarter performance, as well as our revised guidance. In the second quarter, we built on the momentum from the beginning of the year and our business mix improved as consumer mobility increased across many markets. Our Q2 organic revenue was up 37% comprised of concentrate shipments up 26% and price/mix improvement of 11% as we lapped the biggest pandemic impacts of 2020. Unit case growth was 18%. Our shipments outpaced unit cases in the quarter and year-to-date due to cycling the destocking we experienced last year and certain timing impacts this year, including five additional days in the first quarter. Improvement in the away-from-home channels and positive segment mix from higher growth in our finished goods businesses positively impacted our price/mix. Channel and package mix also affected comparable gross margin, which showed significant improvement relative to last year, even with certain inflationary costs like transportation coming through. As we have said throughout the pandemic, our goal is to emerge stronger and we are investing ahead of recovery as markets reopen. As a result, we have doubled our marketing dollars year-over-year, cycling the significant pullback from the same period last year. Even with a step-up in those investments, we delivered a 170-basis-point improvement in comparable operating margins driven by the strong topline. Below operating income, we saw a benefit from improvement in our equity income, as our bottling partners also emerged stronger, as well as reduced interest expense on a comparable basis. As a result, second quarter comparable EPS of $0.68 was an increase of 61% year-over-year. We also delivered strong year-to-date free cash flow of approximately $5 billion, double last year\u2019s results. Our cash flow performance has also driven the return of our leverage to within the targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times. Since we reiterated guidance last quarter, the operating environment and our business have clearly improved. Given the improvement year-to-date and the increased visibility, we are raising our outlook for the full year. We now expect to deliver year-over-year organic revenue growth of 12% to 14% and comparable EPS growth of 13% to 15% in 2021. Our steady focus on cash generation continues to yield progress and our updated guidance for free cash flow of at least $9 billion implies a dividend payout ratio significantly improved from where we began the year and is edging closer to our targeted level of 75% over the long-term. So as we think about the remainder of the year a few things to keep in mind. The recovery phase continues to be asynchronous creating a dynamic demand environment in addition to causing many parts of the supply chain to experience tightness as a result. While experiencing some isolated pressure points, our team is navigating the challenges well through supplier diversification and inventory management. Despite recent upward pressures in many commodities driven by pandemic related disruption, we feel good about the rest of the year and as we anticipate hedges rolling off in 2022, we are working with our system to take appropriate action in the back half of this year to manage the ongoing volatility using revenue growth management capabilities and supply chain productivity levers. With regard to marketing investment, we have three priorities, increase consumer-facing marketing spend toward levels similar to 2019, improve the quality of that spend, and allocate the spend in a more targeted manner. Our currency outlook continues to contemplate a tailwind of 1% to 2% to the topline and approximately 2% to 3% to comparable EPS in 2021, based on current spot rates and our hedge positions. That said, the currency markets remain volatile and dependent on recovery from the pandemic, as well as macroeconomic factors. We will also have some additional timing considerations with the leveling out of our concentrate shipments that are running a bit ahead year-to-date, as well as six fewer days in the fourth quarter. To summarize, our company and our system have tackled many challenges through the pandemic, but we are emerging stronger, thanks to the hard work of our people and the focus on our strategic priorities. With our networked organization up and running, we are on a path to operate more efficiently and effectively, and to unlock the enormous potential we have in our brand and across our markets. As James mentioned earlier, we remain clear eyed as we look at the rest of the year, with many markets continuing to face obstacles, such as the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, but others continue to see the benefits of reopening. Overall, we are pleased with our progress in the first half of the year and we are grateful for the commitment from the stakeholders across our ecosystem that contributed to our results. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, guys. So, on the revenue front, in markets like the U.S., where COVID concerns have now dissipated, can you just discuss how quickly consumer behavior is coming back? How that compares versus what you originally expected, presumably it\u2019s better than expected with the raised full year top line guidance? But how that impacts your strategy going forward and maybe also what you see is the lasting changes in consumer behavior in some of those markets?\nJames Quincey: Yeah. Sure, Dara. Well, firstly, I am not sure I would characterize the U.S. as past COVID. It\u2019s certainly moved to a phase like lot of the other markets where there\u2019s high levels of vaccination where the COVID, the most serious parts of the COVID are affecting, mainly the unvaccinated, as well as some of the vulnerable. So it\u2019s not over and we can see that in the numbers. If you just take a look for a second at what\u2019s happened in the U.S., a couple of interesting things as it\u2019s moved into this reopening phase. Firstly, consumers, as we\u2019ve talked before on these calls, we\u2019ve always believed that humans are social creatures. And that once the restrictions come down and the panorama of the virus allows people with confidence to go out that they will go back out all of the away-from-home channels. They want to be social and they will go after the experiences and this you can see very much beginning to happen in the second quarter. So if we look at our away-from-home channels, you can obviously see large rebounds compared to the second quarter last year, which is obviously logical given how much they fell last year. But they have not yet all reached the levels of 2019. You can take a couple of channels like QSR, which was one of the ones that went down least last year as they pushed delivery, as they pushed pickup and closed the in-room dining. Those channels -- even though many QSRs have still not yet fully reopened in restaurant dining, they have bounced back and are back kind of at or above 2019 levels. So Q -- for example, QSR did well and they are doing very well now, whereas if you take channels like bars and taverns, they went down by about three quarters last -- Q2 last year. Now, of course, they have reopened, people have flocked back and they have gone up by 200-odd percent, but that still means they are not back to 2019 levels and you can go through the various away-from-home channels. You \u2013 obviously, travel and transportation are very like about. So people who had a good second quarter last have generally held on or expanded on those gains in this 2021. And some which have bounced back are still not there, in part because COVID restrictions are still not fully gone and confidence is still not fully back. But interestingly, and I think, positively, from the Coca-Cola Company\u2019s point of view, if you look at the at-home channels, those that -- those gains or those -- that extra consumer interaction with brands and products at-home over the last 15 months has created some new behaviors and engagement with brands that may well be enduring. So it\u2019s quite possible that over time, we will both regain the away-from-home business that we had before and hang on to some of the gains in the at-home. And you can look at e-commerce, which was the poster child for growth in Q2 last year, which grew exponentially. That has basically stabilized, grown a little bit this year. So they\u2019ve held on to a step-up. But you can also see that in some of the large stores, which obviously did well last year. They continued to grow this year, so you are getting growth-on-growth and even the small stores that were impacted last year are bouncing back. So, net-net, if you look at the U.S., you see an enduring resilience in the step-up of the at-home business and a rebound in the away-from-home business that is in-progress but not yet complete, and I think, that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the business. And that pattern I think is very visible if you look around other countries at like stages of development in the COVID trajectory. In other words, restrictions are coming down and there\u2019s a high percentage of the population vaccinated, and therefore, reopening whether it\u2019s the UK or other places going into Europe.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. John, you offered definitely some perspective on the bigger picture profitability, and I know this quarter was kind of a new high watermark on operating margins. But I was curious if you think about the full year, and frankly, even into 2022, how you are thinking about the ability to better leverage your sales growth as a result of some of the restructuring work that you\u2019ve been doing, but also in the vein of this come out stronger and what you\u2019ve been able to achieve already and think you will still be able to achieve in terms of changing package mix and premiumization. And so, again, it\u2019s sort of a longer-term margin question with the awareness that perhaps this quarter is more timing than something directly related to my question? Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: Yeah. Thanks, Lauren. And you are right, it would take the rest of the call to explain all that happened before, so I will spare you. But let\u2019s take a step back and I think it\u2019s the first part to your question or the first part of the answer is, let\u2019s think about the two-year picture. In 2020, we saw -- at the gross margin line, we saw expansion, driven primarily by a significant scale-back of our operating costs and marketing investments, even despite there being also some gross margin compression in the same period. In 2021, we are pleased with the progress year-to-date on getting gross margins back to where we would like them to be, and I think, we will continue to see us get back close to 2019 levels by the end of the year. But we are also -- as James highlighted in his \u2013 in the script, we are also very focused on investing in our brands and our key markets for the future. We\u2019ve seen a good step-up already year-to-date and we continue to have that as a major priority for the second half of the year. So, in a nutshell, if you take a two-year picture, you are going to see -- on the operating margin front, you will see 2021 is -- there will be some compression versus 2020, just given the nature of, what I just said, gross margins getting back, not quite there, significant focus on reinvesting back into the business for the mid- to long-term. But the good news, I think, by the end of this year 2021 will be better than 2019. So that\u2019s first part one. Part two is if you look at 2022 onwards, we\u2019ve talked about our flywheel driving the business from the top line through a much stronger marketing and innovation agenda to support the streamlined portfolio of brands that we now are focused on. We\u2019ve talked about innovation as being a continued driver of growth in the future and that all wraps into execution in the marketplace with our bottling partners and through a variety of levers and not the least of which is our RGM lever. So going into 2022, 2023, 2024, the goal is the same as it has been. It\u2019s to continue to be hyper-focused on improving our overall margin equation and Q2 was a good shot in the arm for us to continue on that path.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC.\nNik Modi: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I was -- James, I was hoping you can talk a little bit about WABI and the fact that you are rolling out to more countries. Maybe if you could just give us some topics on where exactly you are rolling it out? And what have you seen from that initiative from a data standpoint, because I know you can get direct access to that whereas maybe some other direct-to-consumer platforms you won\u2019t get that data and if it\u2019s something that you think could work in the U.S. market.\nJames Quincey: Sure. WABI is a set of features in a digital ecosystem that allow us to both do direct-to-consumer and I will come back to it specifically how, and to do B2B both or either for just the beverages or for multi-category orders. Now predominantly where we are using WABI in partnership with our bottlers is more in the B2B space. We have done some experiments doing B2C, but in the case of WABI, the model that was used which is very appropriate in Latin America, where you have a very high density of mom-and-pop stores, essentially the consumer uses the WABI app to place an order. If they want to have a whole set of Cokes and Fantas and Sprites or whatever, that order goes into the app. And the app then shops the order to the mom-and-pops that are nearest to the consumer and they can accept that order much like a ride hailing service and given that they are likely to be 50, 100, 200 meters from the consumer in these high density cities, they will just run around the product and deliver it in a very short space of time, 15 minutes or 20 minutes or less. And so it is very interesting and we have actually also used that platform with some of the QSR restaurants in places like Argentina to do the same thing. So it\u2019s an interesting experiment. We are getting a lot of insights and data. We have also expanded on the B2C place to actually add other categories of other FMCG partners so now you can place an order at the mom-and-pop for a whole series of categories not just beverages, so getting lots of interesting data and insights on that. The other thing that we are doing with B2B with a number of the bottlers is using it to accelerate the digitization of one part of the relationship particularly with the fragmented trade, whether it be the mom-and-pops or restaurants and cafes around the world, which is of course, now that the rollout of smartphones and smart devices everywhere is expanding, you don\u2019t necessarily need the salesperson to turn up at the store in order to capture an order. And so we are blending the use of the sales force to drive account development and drive all of the in-store activations that we know create impulse purchases and give us advantaged execution, but leverage the platforms to drive order taking. And again, we are getting a lot of learnings with the bottler on how that improves not just efficiency, but just as importantly, the effectiveness of the selling and the execution process. Again, there are, depending on where you are in the world, sometimes that\u2019s just a beverage approach, but we have also got some experiments where it\u2019s a multi-category approach through the platform and links to either wholesalers who deliver either all or the non-beverage categories, et cetera. Anyway, standing back, the net of it is, we continue to see the ongoing digitization of the interaction both at the consumer with the retailer and the retailer with the suppliers. And we think that the Coke system globally with our bottling partners is in a tremendous position to expand the depth of our relationship with the retailers and we are being open minded as to exactly what format takes and working with them to drive a whole set of experiments to see what works, more to come.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: Hey. Good morning. So I think just a follow-up to Lauren\u2019s question earlier around margins and then just two items, John, if you can provide. One is just in terms of marketing for this year, I think, I heard, the way I read it was that you have actually increased the spend or plan to increase the spend now more versus, I guess, what was in your original plan? And then the second, if I don\u2019t know if I missed it, but just can you give us kind of where we stand today in terms of how much of the savings from the reorganization have been captured and how much more there is to go?\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Bryan. Yeah. On the first part, I think, again, looking at the year-to-date, I think, we saw a big rebound in the second quarter. We are doubling our spend on consumer facing activities and for the rest of the year with an eye to both delivering the year, but also being well-prepared for 2022, we have a very robust investment agenda that will see us getting back to 2019 levels and that\u2019s just comparing dollars. When you look under the hood though, I think, one of the big changes we have made in recent months is to improve the quality of that spend. And so my working with Manolo, our objective is to be able to actually generate more with the same and we are pleased with the progress that we are making in that space, particularly as you think about some of the newer areas, digital media, et cetera. Regarding the savings, it\u2019s a piece of the overall equation, and I think, for me, rather than provide hard numbers, it gives us a degree of flexibility to invest behind some of the bigger bets to think about our ongoing ability to pivot as market conditions dictate. And so it\u2019s really less around taking those savings to the bottomline and much more around having to flex to be well-positioned to go after opportunities as we see them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Thanks and good morning. James, maybe John wants to answer too, but following up on where you started with Dara and panning out globally, the updated guidance from today seems to call for a further acceleration in underlying growth on a two-year basis in the back half versus 2019, especially at the top end of the range? And I guess, I am curious where you see that most being sourced from a segment perspective, but also whether you have a bias as to that acceleration and sequential improvement being more volume led versus 2019 or price/mix led as the system fights through inflation or whether you see a bit of both, just how you are thinking about the mix of revenue in the back half? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yeah. Sure. So our expectations for the year, obviously, we said we wanted to get back to 2019 levels and we made good progress and we believe we are emerging stronger, and we are obviously raising the guidance. As we look into the back half of the year, as John said, we are being clear eyed about the puts and takes that exist out there. I think the first thing I would suggest to you is really take a look at the 2021, whether it\u2019s whichever quarter you want to look at and have it on a two-year stack basis, whether that be the volume or the price/mix. Obviously, you have got to look through the stocking and destocking of the gallons, because obviously, this time last year, we were de-stocking gallons rapidly and then notwithstanding the extra days in the first quarter, we have been restocking gallons in this second quarter. But if you look at volume and price/mix on a two-year basis, what we are expecting to see is, yes, some continued improvement into the back half of the year on a two-year stacked volume basis as more countries get more vaccinations done and more restrictions come off. Clearly, there\u2019s plenty of room for different things to happen, the famous asynchronization because markets go up and markets go down. But generally speaking, we expect to see steady -- some steady, although, very moderate, sequential improvements on a two-year basis.  And similarly on a price/mix basis, we are looking, actually, we start looking at price/mix on a two-year basis in Q2. You see it in the sort of ballpark we have always talked about. We have always talked about in the long-term growth model that we are kind of expecting two to three on price on any average year and when you start looking on an annual, on a two-year basis and taking the annual increase, you start to see that in the second quarter. And so our expectations of price/mix are not to see something radically different, notwithstanding the 11 you saw in the second quarter. Clearly it\u2019s not going to continue at 11 because it\u2019s cycling a much more negative number in Q2 last year, which is heavily driven by package and channel mix. But once you look through all of that, we -- in underlying terms essentially maintaining the same approach that we have had historically pre-COVID during this kind of re-opening.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good morning. I actually had a question on your guidance. You raised your full year outlook given the strength you saw in the quarter, but you didn\u2019t flow through the entire beat especially on the bottomline, given your new guidance now suggests EPS growth in the second half will be negative. So I was really hoping to understand the drivers behind this, is it cost pressures that might have gotten worse in the last few months versus the planned stepped up investments that you called out ahead of the recovery? Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Bonnie. A couple of comments, one is, the first half of the year, we saw gallons ahead of cases, which we would expect to normalize in the second half of the year. So I think you have got to factor that into account. Secondly, in the first quarter we had a few extra days and they would come off in the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s a big piece of the equation that we have designed for the full year. And then secondly, as we have already discussed, in the investment space too, we look to sort of end the full year with our marketing investments continuing to step up and margins back to better than 2019, but not as strong as 2020. So that\u2019s all factored in.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi. Can you -- just maybe oversimplifying it, but can you maybe help us, your business has changed a bit in recent years? And maybe if you could just help us with what operating leverage looks like, does a 5% revenue mean a 7% profit growth, does 6% revenue mean 10%? Can you just give us an idea where leverage lives down the P&L?\nJohn Murphy: Yeah. I\u2019d say that refer us back to our long-term algorithm. We are managing to as we have been discussing a very interesting period. We still think that the, when you take all of the puts and takes with the businesses that we have at the moment that the long-term algorithm is still one that best reflects what we can deliver over the coming years. Now, clearly, as the business mix changes, we would need to review that. But I think the -- I\u2019d just refer you back to the algorithm and we don\u2019t see that changing in the foreseeable future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with J.P. Morgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Hi. Thank you so much. So I just wanted to go back to the how the on-premise has been tracking as you exit the quarter. So I was hoping to see if you can, it sounds, James, is sounds that you are confident that we are seeing that lapping, and obviously, looking at the U.S. as an example, as you mentioned, you were quite confident that worldwide we are going to see that adding to the recovery and adding to the at-home consumption. So I was hoping to see how you exit the quarter in places where infections have come back on a global basis and how can you quantify how volume sits relative to 2019 levels? I think you called out in developed coming back to the same levels, but -- and how your mix in terms of finished goods and single serve is relative to the 2019?\nJames Quincey: Sure. I will try and offer a few thoughts there that might help. Clearly, when countries have gone, when infections go up and greater restrictions have come back in during the course of the second quarter, you do see negative impacts on the business. Now over the last 15 months, we have worked very hard to make our business more adaptable and more agile and able to pivot in the restrictions to help the consumers get the beverages they love, but often in the very short-term it impacts the business. So if you look at places where infections have spiked up recently in the second quarter, so Vietnam went into some restrictions. They have done a good job of avoiding large restrictions and so they were doing fine the first few months of the year and then all of a sudden they have had some restrictions and they were negative in June. Similarly, India, earlier in the quarter, brought in a strong set of restrictions and the business went negative, but then when they reopened, they bounced back. So clearly, while we have adapted the business and made it more resilient to levels of lockdown, when these do occur, wherever they do occur around the world, it\u2019s going to impact the business. We are going to bounce back quicker and we are going to suffer less, but it is going to impact the business. And so as you think about the outlook, clearly, the direction of travel of COVID, its variants, the levels of infections and the levels of restrictions are going to make a difference to the business.  And then as it relates to immediate consumption and future consumption, if I look on a worldwide basis and I look on a two-year stack rate, what you can see is that now we have steadily improved through the course of the pandemic such that the immediate consumption of volumes are now slightly ahead of 2019 levels as we exited the second quarter in June. So and as I said in the opening or in the reflections on that first question from Dara on the U.S., that has not been followed by a mirror image decline in the at-home. Clearly, some of the at-home on a two-year stack basis goes down because people are now out and about and at work, and so you now see the two of them tracking, you see the at-home tracking at the 2019 levels as well. So that\u2019s why we feel that there\u2019s some sequential improvement coming in the downhill, moderate but some.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. Can you please talk maybe a little bit more about headline pricing and promo intensity? I think I heard you say that in Q2, your pricing was sort of at historical levels of 2% to 3%. I also heard you say that in the second half of the year you would look to address higher input costs with revenue growth management initiatives. So maybe kind of talk about your thoughts on pricing in an environment where we have seen more inflation than we have in many years and how able the consumer is in your key geographies to be able to take additional prices? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yeah. So, clearly, obviously, the comments I made about pricing are on the two-year stack basis and we kind of see when one takes out the effects of channel and geography, what you would see if you had all of the data, but what I am saying is that over the course of the pandemic, we have taken a steady approach to pricing to continue to price for our brand strength and RGM, and then of course, we manage input costs increases over time. And we use our hedging strategies to not have to try and minimize the amount of sudden bumps, because our overall belief is that, if we focus on creating the growth of the beverage category for our retail customers ahead of their overall business then that will be good for them and then we will do and gain share within that overall strategy and that is best executed through steady investment in brands, steady investment in execution, and the use of RGM to meet the consumer with the pack size and the price point that they want. And that includes, then, managing through the increases in input costs in a rational and staged way and we obviously leverage hedging to make that easier for us to do. And so we do believe that categories, well, those people who have brands that have strong consumer resonance will be able to pass through costs, as we have done historically. We have -- whilst in the U.S. inflation has been very moderate for an extended period of time as it has been in Europe, we have plenty of other country in the world which experience high or double-digit levels of inflation. And so the strategy on how to manage through that and stay engaged with the consumer to keep the momentum in the business and keep the margin structure steady or improving is a capability of the system.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Carlos Laboy with HSBC.\nCarlos Laboy: Yes. Good morning, everyone. James, about three years to four years ago you said you wanted more robust experimentation and small experiments become big experiments, drive collaboration and revenues, and we see this thriving in America. But might you share with us perhaps in some developed markets where we don\u2019t have as clear line of sight, how this is coming along and maybe are there some wins that really stand out in this area?\nJames Quincey: Sure. Thanks, Carlos. I mean, we continue to drive the collaborations and the innovations. If I just pick up a few of the ones that we have sort of elliptically connected to today. WABI, which started in Latin America both as B2C and B2B. We have used the platform to work with our bottlers in other parts of the world, whether that be Europe or beyond, on helping us work together to improve the digitization and the B2B capability beyond that. So you are seeing expansions of those experiments out of Latin America. You will see expansions of experiments in the U.S., whether it be AHA, which has continued to perform very well in the U.S. so far this year. We have launched that in China or in fairlife, which has done very well in the U.S. We are taking that to China as well. And so there\u2019s some kind of moving from the west to the east. You have got experiments that were taking place on Topo Chico Hard Seltzer which kind of started in a way as a global idea. It\u2019s now in each of the continents and we have continued to expand it. There are some things going on in Asia in the kind of non-black tea segments where we experimented in some of the ASEAN countries and is expanding round. So there really are some great experiments out there. You could even go to some of the packaging ones like the use of rPET, 100% recycled PET, which is really a key factor in driving a circular economy around packaging materials, started really in Europe, coming to the U.S. recently with the 13-ounce bottle that we have put into the market. So we are never satisfied as a kind of philosophical starting point, but they are certainly starting to see more experiments happen out there and more discipline in working, which aren\u2019t working and stopping them and which have legs to be taken to the next place. And interestingly, you are starting to see those experiments move in all directions. It\u2019s not just developed -- to developing or west to east or any one direction. It\u2019s actually really starting to be ideas coming from all around the world and really having to go through and work out, which ones deserve the shot at expanding globally.\nJohn Murphy: And if I may, James, I think, in the supply chain also there\u2019s over the last 12 months to 18 months it\u2019s a tremendous amount of partnership collaboration that is delivering results in the individual entities across the world that I think will continue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning. A question for James, just picking up on the last line of questioning there around innovation, my question specifically for hard seltzers and some of the early success that you have had there. So, James, you mentioned some of the early learnings. I was hoping you could perhaps share those with us, particularly as it pertains to the seltzer category? And then more broadly, James, whether the success that you have had in the alcohol space emboldens the company a bit for further exploration in alcohol sort of outside non-alcohol? Your comments there would be helpful. Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yeah. Sure. So we are still very much in the learning phase. It\u2019s not a category we are familiar with, particularly with the alcohol. It\u2019s got a number of important characteristics and regulatory characteristics and business characteristics that we need to learn about. So we have not got to a stage of concluding anything more strategic or coming to the point of view that there is a bigger vision for us out there in the flavored alcoholic beverage space. We want to learn and understand more before we decide anything one direction or the other. As it relates to some of the learnings so far, I mean, clearly, what we have discovered is obviously it makes a difference if the category exists or doesn\u2019t exist in any particular country. I mean, we are in 17 markets to-date. We are on track to be in 28 markets around the world by the end of the year. We are learning what it takes to compete where the category exists. We are learning what it takes to help grow the category where it doesn\u2019t exist. So we are pleased, for example, in Latin America, where for example, in Mexico, we are the number two hard seltzer and getting some good traction and good velocity in Brazil, where it\u2019s more of an undeveloped category. There\u2019s more kind of development needed as we are trying to work out how that happens. Similarly in Europe, it\u2019s the number one or two performer in terms of rates and velocity in Europe and so I think it\u2019s very interesting what\u2019s happening there. And obviously in the U.S., it\u2019s got a lot of good traction, while it\u2019s still of course relatively small overall nationally, it\u2019s done particularly well where we have focused or where Molson is focused to launch, which is in Texas and it\u2019s done very well in Texas, looking good in kind of the southern states, California, in Florida too. Retail customers, we understand they are very bullish, lots of display activity and activity. So we are looking to see that continue to expand. Of course, we are conscious that the overall hard seltzer category has come down in terms of its overall growth rates in the U.S. That\u2019s not ultimately that big of a surprise to us, because it is a category that has been predominantly an at-home channel category, much less bars and restaurants category. And so as people have gone back out, clearly, some of those occasions have moved from at-home to away-from-home. So it\u2019s not too surprising that some of the strong tailwinds the category got in the lockdowns have lessened. But we still think it\u2019s very interesting. It\u2019s got some long-term potential in the U.S. It\u2019s very on-trend for a lot of consumers. And so we are continuing to look at that and push on that and invest to see where we can go.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sean King with UBS.\nSean King: Great. Thanks for the question. How do you stand to benefit from the Olympics starting later this week, really given a pandemic driven disruption around the world? Can you shed any light on any marketing activation plans or just a general outlook on this opportunity given the pent-up sort of excitement for this type of event?\nJames Quincey: Yeah. I mean, in terms of kind of two ways of looking at it, one, those countries where the Olympics are broadcast too and then the actual activation in Japan itself. I mean, clearly, in Japan, given the restrictions, we have dialed back all the physical activations and are supporting appropriately, keeping supply of beverages to the athletes, et cetera. But the physical activation is essentially not going to happen. And then -- and so really it\u2019s as much as anything, it\u2019s about leveraging the airtime that the Olympics are going to get in places like the U.S. to market our programs. But very specific marketing activation at a large galley isn\u2019t going to happen in part because of the slight uncertainty of whether they were going to happen or not led us to move away from having any large extra fixed cost investment in activating the market, the Olympics for this year and so we will leverage the airtime to market our brands. You can still note even today the deputy, one of the people in Tokyo said that, who knows what\u2019s going to happen whether it will actually start. So we very much are taking the approach of take away the physical activation, take away any fixed cost that can only be used in the event of the Olympics and use any rights and times we have for the general marketing of our brands.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim.\nLaurent Grandet: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in. Got a question on Coca-Cola Zero, please, you had the market to re-launch Coca-Cola Zero with new packaging and recipe both for Coke Regular, so in countries where it has already been launched, is the value you are seeing coming from Regular actually or Diet or competition. So any color would help. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yeah. Laurent, I mean, we are -- obviously, the answer is it depends in a way, because each country has a slightly different mix from the starting point of Zero or depending if you are in a country that still has got Diet or Light and the size of Classic. So the starting point matters. Two, clearly it\u2019s a mix of everything. What we like most about driving Coke Zero Sugar is we get a lot of business that is not self-cannibalization. If it was all just coming from Coke and Coke Light, it would be perhaps necessary, but not very exciting. What\u2019s exciting about it is that we are helping expand the Coke franchise. So, in other words, if you start standing back and looking at it globally, you can see both the growth of Coke Original, the very fast Coke growth of Coke Zero, only some of which is coming from the cannibalization of Coke Light or Diet Coke depending on where you are in the world. So it\u2019s a net accretion to the Coke franchise.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.\nJames Quincey: Thanks very much everyone. As we said at the beginning, look we are delivering on the priorities we set out for ourselves to emerge stronger. Hopefully, you could see that in both the results and our guidance. And we just want to take the opportunity to thank once again the extraordinary effort of our associates, of our bottling partners and all our partners that have allowed us to deliver these results and to raise our guidance for the outlook. Our system is strong. Our bottling partners are strong. We continue to invest behind momentum and the huge growth opportunity ahead of us. Thanks for your interest, your investment and for joining us today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "KO", "quarter": 1, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-04-19 15:37:07", "content": "Operator: At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Coca-Cola Company's First Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's media relations department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Leveridge, Vice President of Investor Relations, Financial Planning, and Analysis. Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator. I apologize, but there will be a slight delay in today\u2019s conference. Please hold and the conference will resume momentarily. Thank you for your patience.\nTim Leveridge: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our Chief Financial officer.  Before we begin, please note that we posted schedules under the Financial Information tab in the investors section of our company website at www.coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion, to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. You can find schedules in the same section of our company website that provide an analysis of gross and operating margins. In addition, this conference call may contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report. Following prepared remarks this morning, we'll turn the call over to your questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first and then re-enter the queue. Now I'd like to turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In what remains a highly dynamic environment, our first quarter results show promising signs that a broader recovery is on the horizon. We're encouraged by early results in markets where mobility is on the rise. This morning, I'll share what we're seeing around the world and provide an update on the actions we've taken to accelerate our transformation, including improvements in our portfolio, innovation, and marketing approaches enabled by the evolution of our culture and our network organization. Then, I'll hand over the call to John to discuss the financial details of the quarter, and how we'll continue to deliver on our objectives over the course of the year. In the first quarter, we positioned our business to recovery while executing against our emerging stronger agenda, equipping our system to win. At the start of the year, pandemic-related lockdowns were still impacting many markets. We moved quickly as conditions changed, improving along the way and getting better at managing each wave and its resulting lockdowns. During the quarter, we saw mobility increase in some parts of the world where lockdowns eased and vaccinations accelerated. Leveraging our learnings, we drove sequential improvement in our business throughout the quarter. And while we saw mid-single-digit volume declines through mid February, trends have improved since then. We're pleased to say that March marked a return to volume levels seen in March 2019 prior to the pandemic.  We continue to see ongoing strength in at-home channels offset by away from home trends, which have improved sequentially, but remain pressured relative to pre pandemic levels. We're working with our customers and bottling partners to sustain at-home momentum and capture improving away-from-home demand. For example, in Latin America, our Prospera program with our bottlers helps the traditional trade thrive through assistance with their marketing efforts, resulting in outperformance in this critical channel. In Great Britain, we launched Open, a business accelerator program to support pubs, bars, and cafes. In North America, our use of meal bundles is driving incidence in pickup and delivery transactions with foodservice customers. In 2020, we gained underlying share in both at-home and away-from-home channels offset by negative channel mix. This continues to be the dynamic affecting our share year-to-date. Through our ongoing initiatives and as away-from-home demand improves over the course of the year, we will seek to build on these wins in 2021. There are clear opportunities to reaccelerate share positions as the recovery plays out and we will invest to drive momentum with focus on flexibility. In markets at the forefront of the recovery, we've seen early signs that our actions taken during the pandemic are helping us outpace recovery. It's important to note that the path to a full recovery remains asynchronous around the world. Many markets haven't yet turned a corner and are still managing through the restrictions. Looking around the world in Asia Pacific, China continues to lead the recovery with volume in the first quarter ahead of 2019 results and foot traffic almost back to pre-pandemic levels. Strong performance in India and Southwest Asia was driven by effective marketing across brands, affordable solutions and distribution expansion with 250,000 new outlets and 45% more new coolers. Despite the unexpected state of emergency earlier in the year, Japan expanded its successful RGM initiatives geographically and across brands to help drive improvements later in the quarter. In EMEA, vaccine rollout in Europe has been slower than anticipated, and many countries have been impacted by ongoing lockdowns. In Eurasia and Middle East, brand Coke recruited 4.4 million consumers through affordability packages and a focus on at-home occasions. New marketing campaigns drove improvement in flavored sparkling soft drinks and FUZE TEA registered an all-time high value share in Turkey. In Africa, mass vaccination is expected to take longer than the developed markets; and despite ongoing volatility, Africa worked closely with our bottlers to deliver volume growth led by stepped-up execution through cooler placement and affordability packs like returnable glass bottles. In North America, the year is off to a good start. Ongoing strength in at-home channels was driven by core brands in our Sparkling portfolio as well as Simply, fairlife, and Gold Peak, all with encouraging results. Away from home began to improve in March as vaccinations and mobility picked up. In Latin America, we leveraged our core brands, digital initiatives, and refillable packages to recover ahead of the economy and our industry despite ongoing restrictions. While from away from home continues to be impacted by lockdowns, we're expanding the at-home consumption opportunity leveraging consumer dynamics like indulgence of single-serve multi-packs. Global Ventures continue to be impacted by lockdowns in the UK. But as restrictions loosen, we're focusing on driving digital engagement and traffic back to the cost of stores. Cost of express machines continued to deliver strong performance. Turning to our transformation, our operating units are up and running and off to a very good start in the rollout of our new model. Across markets, our newly networked organization has us working more collaboratively with the overall enterprise in mind. Our operating unit and category leadership teams are working together to identify the most promising combinations across the industry based on economic outlook, consumer trends, channel dynamics, and execution imperatives. We're using more disciplined resource allocation to capture the biggest opportunities while making ongoing portfolio decisions faster and at scale. We're focused on our streamlined growth portfolio actively and thoughtfully transitioning brands to more powerful trademarks using a phased approach to bring the consumer with us on the journey. And we're maximizing shelf space and new product launches and higher velocity products to drive higher-quality growth. As we discussed at CAGNY, we're focusing on what we do best, marketing our loved brands in more efficient and effective ways. As Sprite Let's Be Clear campaign kicked off in markets from Asia to Africa to Latin America, the message is resonating with consumers with impressions, views, and engagement levels above last year, and intent-to-purchase metrics showing promising signs. This campaign aligns with our transition to a more sustainable clear bottle, which is important in helping us achieve our world without waste goals. Our media and creative agency reviews are progressing and we're also executing more targeted opportunities in addition to the big strategic shifts. For instance, we've taken a scaled, digitized approach to buying trade materials, resulting in up to 15% cost reduction and improved user experience, all while offering more consistent, better quality, and sustainable alternatives. We've extended this pool buying opportunity to our bottlers, many of whom are already on board to share the benefits systemwide. And our more disciplined innovation approach is yielding results as we balance big bets with intelligent experimentation. Using our network approach, we're scaling our best innovations quickly and effectively, while being disciplined with those that don't get the traction required for further investment. Local experiments like Aquarius with functional benefits and Ayataka Cafe Matcha Latte in Japan Fanta's exciting mystery flavor innovation in Europe. And package innovations like a 13.2 ounce recycled PT bottle in North America could all be lifted and shifted globally over time, similar to what we're doing this year with a half flavored sparkling water. Our big bets for 2021 include ongoing work to scale our coffee platform on the Costa. We're expanding ready to drink coffee in China and taking portfolio approach to complement our powerful Georgia coffee brand in Japan. We're also rolling out an enhanced formula and package designed for Coca Cola Zero Sugar this month in Europe and Latin America and across markets globally later this year. The improved recipe brings its taste even close to that of the iconic Coca Cola original taste. These were influenced by consumer insights and are focused on constant improvement. And despite its enormous success, Coca Cola Zero Sugar still represents a relatively small percentage of the trademark. And we continue to respond to consumer desires for lower sugar options, and the rollout will be supported by a global occasion based marketing campaign. Finally, it's early days. But we're excited to come back and report on an expanded experimentation in flavored alcoholic beverages with Topo Chico Hard Seltzer in Latin America, Europe, and most recently the US. We also continue to rapidly digitize our ecosystem. For example, our Chatbot in South Africa engages with consumers on social media to increase away from home transactions. In China, we've used digital campaigns to harness consumer data to drive traffic, and incidents leading to incremental growth. We're using machine learning and AI tools to stay on top of a rapidly evolving consumer trends and identify emerging needs. Our dedicated digital transformation structure leading to strong online to offline growth. We've seen ecommerce share gains in key advanced markets like North America, Japan and Great Britain. And in markets like Turkey, where the channel is still developing with more than tripled sales, and gained almost 10 points per share versus last year. As always, we're supporting these initiatives with strong revenue growth management and execution. Through RGM, we continue to capture at-home occasions with multi-pack options in both premium and affordable segments, while expanding distribution of smaller packaging like our sleek cans in China. And we have affordability plays like a successful refillables in Latin America to Philippines and now Africa. As part of our new organization, we're dedicating more resources to RGM continuing to raise the bar to even higher standards. In many markets, we're working with our bottling partners to optimize cooler placement, driving incremental volume through outstanding customer service, higher cooler productivity and innovation. Our bottling partners are executing strongly. And together, we are working on initiatives across the enterprise to identify more efficiency. We're operating in a networked way, leveraging our platform services organization to scale our collected data, marketing, digital and supply chain capabilities. Our system continues to evolve, as shown by the pending combination of Coca Cola, European partners, and Coca Cola Amatil. And just this morning, we announced our intent to list Coca Cola beverages Africa as an independent African bottler through an initial public offering. I'm especially proud of how we're delivering on our purpose as a company. Every action is guided by our ambition to create a more sustainable business and better shared future that makes a difference in people's lives, our communities and the planet. Throughout the pandemic, we focus on helping communities through relief funds from the company and the Coca Cola Foundation. In this next phase, we are supporting vaccination efforts in regions where distribution has been slower. For instance, in Brazil, our system has partnered with the country's Ministry of Health to co create a vaccine awareness campaign. We're using our network to deliver 700,000 posters with vaccine information to more than 350,000 mom and pop stores. Tomorrow we will release our 2020 business and ESG report where we will highlight last year's progress. While 2020 was a milestone year in terms of meeting and exceeding some previous goals, by women's empowerment and Global Water replenishment, we continue to work toward an even more ambitious agenda. This includes our 2025 and 2030 packaging goals, our 2030 climate goal and our new 2030 water security strategy, with more details to come later this year. In conclusion, we're optimistic about the future and bullish about our ability to continue to deliver on the objectives we laid out at the height of the crisis. More consumers, more share, better system economics and a positive stakeholder impact. Now I'll turn the call to John to discuss how we're delivering results through a continued dynamic environment.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James. And good morning to everybody on the call. Today, I will highlight our first quarter performance and go over our top line and earnings guidance which we are reiterating. Then I'll provide a progress update on working capital, our ability to manage through the current commodity environment, and other factors that may impact our outlook. 2021 is off to a good start with the quarter showing steady sequential monthly improvement. We're leveraging our learnings and strategic initiatives from 2020 and leaning into growth in a thoughtful way. Our Q1 organic revenue was up 6% driven by concentrates shipments of 5%. And price mix improvement of 1%. By shipments benefit from certain timing impacts and the five additional days this quarter versus last year. Unit case volume was flat versus the toughest quarterly compare of 2020. And March volume was in line with 2019 levels, largely driven by strength in Asia Pacific. Comparable gross margins although still down year-over-year improved sequentially driven by less pressure from channel and package mix. And while currency was still somewhat of a drag, it was less of a headwind than prior quarters.  Comparable operating margin expanded through ongoing discipline cost management. We continue to reintroduce marketing spend in a targeted way, particularly as we ramp up investments in markets that are seeing recovery. First quarter comparable EPS of $0.55 is an increase of 8% year-over-year and was driven by top line growth, margin improvement and some contribution from equity income offset by currency headwinds. Regarding our ongoing tax case with the IRS, there are no material updates since our last report. Our decisions and actions from last year certainly were not easy. But we are seeing the results of our efforts start to come through. And our organization is embracing the changes as we move forward into the recovery phase. We stayed very focused on driving a healthy top line. And we remain on a journey to maximize returns, including strong cash flow generation. We never relented on our cash flow goals, and indeed have had an even sharper focus on managing capital spend and working capital. Since we embarked on a journey toward best-in-class working capital performance, we've made great strides in extending our payment terms, generating a working capital improvement of more than a $1 billion over two years. In the same vein, we are implementing accounts receivables factoring programs, which are rolling out across a number of markets, and also looking at initiatives to better manage inventory days. At the center of these efforts, is a robust digitization, and automation agenda. In addition, and you've heard us talk conceptually about the network model. This is a great example of the network in action. When you put the right people from different parts of the organization against key initiatives, it delivers a step change in performance. Last quarter, we said that despite rising commodity environments, we expected a relatively benign impact in 2021, given our hedged positions. While this continues to be the case, we're closely monitoring upward pressure in some inputs, such as high fructose corn syrup, PT, metals, and other packaging materials that impact us as well as our bottling partners. Given the environment we will continue to benefit from revenue growth management initiatives through intelligently diverse price tag architecture, we can produce a range of options that meet the needs of consumers across the income spectrum, while also capturing value for customers. 2020 provided great learnings on how to be more surgical and data driven in our promotions, and we will continue to be purposeful in our approach, driven by the consumer and the strength of our brands. We will also continue to pursue productivity across the supply chain pushing all levers at our disposal. Since we last provided guidance, the US dollar has strengthened. And as we noted in our release, we now expect currency to be a tailwind of approximately 1% to 2% to the top line, and approximately 2% to 3% to comparable EPS in 2021 based on current spot rates and our hedged positions. For the full year, we now expect an underlying effective tax rate of 19.1%. Putting it all together, our quarterly performance and the momentum we saw in March give us confidence in our ability to achieve our 2021 guidance. We expect high single digit organic revenue growth and high single digit to low double digit growth in comparable earnings per share. We still expect recovery to be a synchronous and to see signs of return to normal in more markets later in 2021. We are preparing our end-to-end supply chain for stronger demand and will fuel the momentum in recovering markets as they emerge from the pandemic by accelerating investments in our brands. There's no doubt that uncertainty remains. Europe continues to see challenges, many countries and regions like Latin America and Africa, expect further waves and slower vaccine distribution. And India is seeing a surge in cases and responding with localized lockdowns. But as we begin to lap the most difficult periods from last year, we feel good about our position, and our ability to navigate the environment, as a company, and as a system. Based on the lessons we've learned, and the agility provided by our new networked organization. We remain confident that our actions and the progress we've made will enable us to deliver 2021 earnings at or above 2019 levels. With that operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDaraMohsenian: Hey, guys. So clearly top line growth in Q1, and it recovered to a greater extent than the market expected. You guys mentioned a good start to the year with sequential improvement. So, I guess, a, can you just discuss volume trends in March in markets where restrictions have loosened and mobility has picked up such as the US, maybe contrast that with the markets where restrictions are still in place and what that portends going forward? And then, b, totally understand it's a very fluid environment. But with March volume already back to 2019 levels with the topline upside in the quarter, can you just help me understand the unchanged full-year topline outlook? And is it just that it's early given the volatility and we only have one quarter in the books to become more positive on the full year? Just sort of trying to understand your mindset on the full year revenue guidance relative to the Q1 upside. Thanks.\nJamesQuincey: Sure. Thanks Dara. So firstly, the first quarter was strong. Absolutely, we gained momentum and we achieved that good momentum in the first quarter, which is really the fruition of the emerging stronger plan we set out a year ago, saying we wanted to get back to 2019 levels well ahead of the economy by gaining more share, more customers, better system economics. And I think that's what you're starting to see happen in the first quarter. And obviously, we've been driving that by focusing on the brands and on the innovation. And the bottlers have been executing in the marketplace, and it's certainly heartening to see us get back to 2019 volume levels in March. And we did all of that whilst doing -- finishing the implementation of the reorganization, sothe employees on the company side were able to both deliver the results and stand up the new organization with the operating units and platform services and really hit the ground running. So, I think it is actually a super creditable performance in the first quarter. Secondly, the downhill and the question about guidance. I mean, ultimately, it's early and it's not early, just in a normal sense, it\u2019s early in the context of the pandemic. Also, breaking the news today is that weekly new cases of COVID have hit an all-time peak.  So while vaccinations are rising in many countries, US, UK, et cetera, the flipside is there's actually a new high in terms of cases, obviously a number of developing markets but also Europe as well continental Europe as well. So, the visibility into the downhill is very much linked to the trajectory of the pandemic, and as it relates to our business, the trajectory of the lockdowns, very clearly as we've talked on previous quarters, lockdowns because we have half our business in away from home are impacted directly by the degree of lockdown, and though there are still lockdowns coming on, a number in Europe, some of the developing markets, conversely as markets start to open, it's worth remembering. It's not an on/off switch. There\u2019s a phasing of how markets tend to reopen. And that's true to the US, so for example in the US, the fountain volumes were still negative in March because whilst people are going out to restaurants and there's more mobility, it's not back to what it was. The occupancy levels of offices are nowhere near a 100%, and so reopening is not an on/off switch.  There's a rebuilding and there's a series of phases of reopening. And so, that's a very important factor and it's somewhat unpredictable with the downhill. So it's too early to call not in a business sense, but in a lockdown and reopening sense. And the reality is that there are more cases now than they were a while ago. So, we still feel very confident in our guidance on the top and the bottom line, but there's a lot of managing left to do and we\u2019re certainly focused on giving ourselves the flexibility and agility to be able to do that. And which leads me to my third point, which I think is worth making. Unlike normal times, one should not automatically assume that more revenue is always going to flow straight down to the bottom line. Much as we did in 2020, we are going to be very judicious and focused on investing where we believe reopening and demand is coming back and not investing, if we don't think the response in the marketplace is there. So you're going to see as we go through 2021, we will be looking at both levers. If we see that demand is coming in at the kind of the higher end, there's more reopenings happen more quickly for whatever reason, and revenue start to accelerate, we\u2019re also likely to reaccelerate the restitution of the marketing spend. Conversely, if for whatever reason revenue starts to look a little weaker, then we are likely to hold back on some of the marketing. So, I think it's important as you think about the rest of the year that you don't think of it as normal times one has to think about how we are using the resources judiciously and wanting to invest to drive growth and get back to normal. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryanSpillane: Hey, thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. John, I wanted to pick up on some of the comments you made relative to inflation, and I guess kind of thinking about it past '21 and into '22, just given the recent trends, which have elevated pretty meaningfully across a lot of inputs really across our whole coverage universe. If that stays in effect for '22, can you talk a little bit about what you can do working with the system with the bottlers to try to manage that inflation, and really beyond revenue management? So just how much, what type of actions can you take in terms of procurement, maybe finding inefficiencies that exist between the Coca-Cola company and the bottling systems, just really trying to understand, in a scenario where inflation stays meaningfully elevated in a way that we haven't seen in a real long time, just what types of things you can contemplate to try to help the system manage that inflation.\nJohnMurphy: Thank you, Bryan. Good morning. Good topic. And one that with our bottling partners around the world, we're looking as a very holistic manner, managing inflation is not new to the system. And it's one it's an area that needs to be looked us locally and working closely in partnership with our bottlers. As you're saying the inflationary pressures, particularly surrounding some of our key commodities, looks like it is going to be more of a headwind in '22, '21 we are, as we said, in the release pretty well covered and in good shape. And so when you think about the actions we take, first and foremost, I think it is important to highlight that as an over arching principle around the world, we typically look to take pricing in line with inflation. And I would expect that principle will continue to be adhere to as we move into the back half of '21, and even then into '22. Secondly, while, I know you mentioned beyond RGM, I do think it's important to reinforce the value that RGM brings to being able to execute a pricing strategy in the most relevant and meaningful fashion locally. And so that will continue to be a key priority. Thirdly, on the things that we can do on the productivity area, I would point to our supply chain particularly with our bottling partners in the last 6 to 12 months coming through the pandemic and indeed coming out of us that the level of engagement we've had with our -- within the system unlocking value in the supply chain through greater efficiencies, has been phenomenal. And I would expect that momentum to continue into the rest of this year and into 2022. We have had over the last number of years, the benefits of leveraging our cross enterprise procurement group, a group of people that work on behalf of the entire system around the world that are able to leverage the global scale of the system. And I think arrive us some of the most competitive pricing that we can get that anybody can get when it comes to key inputs. So when you take a sort of an overarching holistic view of us, we've got a, I think, a tried- and-true practice of being able to take pricing enlightenment and inflation leverage RGM to do it in the most intelligent fashion, and increasingly operate as a global system to leverage our scale, taking into account some of the sort of the historic groups we have like cross enterprise procurement, but also new opportunities abounding as a result of the overall strategy we've been pursuing during and after the pandemic.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.\nNikModi: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. James, I was hoping you could provide some tangible examples of how the company's new decision making infrastructure is manifested in better outcomes, generally, and maybe just kind of contrast that to what those decisions would have looked like under the older model. Thank you.\nJamesQuincey: Sure, Nik, a few examples. One, I think John's already mentioned, the cash flow, we struggle for many years to get up into best-in-class cash conversion, or working capital. And the work that has been done by the finance network has produced a great result. And that's clearly flowing through not just in terms of the kind of theoretical, amount of days working capital, but the actual cash coming into the company in the first quarter, which was a really strong result, and then something that we have struggled to do in the past. Another example with -- we have been rolling out a global campaign on Sprite, which has got excellent early traction, in terms of consumer engagement, in terms of purchase intent. And that was developed by the category leads and the key operating units, and has been rolled out across the world, something that we were unable to do or unable to convince ourselves to do historically. And so we believe that is making some cut through. The supply chain optimization working with the bottlers and really focusing on reducing the unit cost of what we do and looking at across all the metrics, and increasing data transparency is happening. And then you go to some of the platform services, where we're really starting to be able to implement, especially in those areas, where one single global solution makes total sense. We've had examples from, buying trade materials, through global platforms driving significant savings for ourselves and the system. And then hopefully, later this month, we'll turn on our latest SAP update, which will go from the one that was done 20 years ago, which was probably one of the world's most complicated and therefore most expensive to a much more effective solution. So I think across the company, from the front end of marketing, and engaging with consumers, through our operations through to the bottlers we're able to make the contact points and get faster, better solutions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLaurenLieberman: Great, thanks so much. Good morning. And this is probably a good lead in from all three of the last questions. But I want to talk a little bit about profitability because it was interesting to me that I think margins in almost every division outside of EMEA were comfortably ahead of where they were in the first quarter of 2019. And knowing that COVID comps weren't necessarily a dynamic for all regions in the first quarter of last year, if I still benchmark back to '19, the profitability improvements are significant. And so I was curious, how much knowing James your comments and wanting to invest to support recovery is a very important dynamic. But how much do you think of that margin improvement that we're seeing. So, at this point is tied to these broad range of cost management initiatives across the board and RGM, inclusive, versus timing of marketing, the need to put back in and continue funding the business, and it may be different region to region, of course, as well. Thanks.\nJamesQuincey: Yes. Thanks, Laura, look, clearly, the reinvestment of marketing is going to vary somewhat by region in 2021 for the reasons I outlined in that answer to the first question. So I think it's important as you think about margins to recognize that 2021 is also going to be a somewhat a typical year, there will be markets around the world where we judge the situation such that we don't have a normal level of marketing. And so that does tend to favor margins, operating margins at that point in time. And so it is important to break it apart and look at it by the different regions. We certainly are not coming out with some numerical margin target for many of the same reasons that we remove the previous target. And we are focused ultimately on growing the business. And embedded in our long-term growth model is an implicit assumption that we can slowly or steadily perhaps better said, improve margins over time, because there is a lot of efficiency work going on within the cost of goods sold, within the DME, particularly the non working part of the DME, we've got a lot of focus on the agency roster and how we spend the money we spend before we even gets to see the consumer. And obviously, we've done the network organization, which was about making us better able to support the growth aspirations, but it is also more efficient organization. And so all those things will go into the mix. And it would be remiss of me to not include the impact of RGM. Because to the extent that we can leverage RGM, that also helps on a gross margin, and ultimately operating income margins. So we will be pulling all those levers as we go through 2021. But again, it won't be a fully normal year in every region. And so you will see some of these strange effects.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlos Laboy with HSBC.\nCarlosLaboy: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Could you give us a sense of where you are seeing some notable progress this past year on digital transformation perhaps tied into this inflation end margin question, right, by commenting on how digital tools are perhaps helping you mitigate or stay ahead of inflationary pressure in some markets that might be getting ahead of the curve here.\nJamesQuincey: I mean, the digital transformation is much above and beyond coping with inflation, although, of course, some of the tools will help us manage if there's an inflationary spike. Clearly, you can look at the digital transformation in terms of our engagement with consumers. And there are some, good examples of progress, China, which is started the year very strongly not just compared to 2020 but compared to 2019. It's been a much bigger shift into digital engagement with consumers or even in Japan with our own Coke On apps that we use to connect people to the vending machines and the cashless options and a large uptick in monthly active consumers. So there is a great deal of progress being made in terms of how we engage through digital media, how we engage directly with consumers in a digital relationship that's helping there, the system I used, I talked about the example of buying materials with digital platforms. But clearly there's a huge piece of what needs to happen, which is the backbone of both the company and the bottlers and the interoperability of all the data, where we're making excellent progress. And ultimately all those insights and all those efficiencies help us manage the inflationary pressures out there whether we use the insights to engage more consumers or use the insight to drive the RGM thinking, an implementation or to identify efficiencies, I mean, in a way digital is becoming just the way business is done. And it's just like saying, I turn up and have to manage the business and use all these tools to do all the things I got to do.\nJohnMurphy: Maybe I just add one comment there, James. If you think about the emerging stronger program that we've outlined over the last six to nine months, it would not have been possible to do three years ago, and the degree to which we have been able to operate in a fast and efficient manner across the globe to deliver this program is all due to the fact that we have essentially become digitized in how we work and how we operate, just to support what James about your last comment there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nStevePowers: Thank you. Maybe pivoting back to the top line. So March volumes back to even with 2019 is just very key and promising milestone. And we've seen sequential progress over the last few quarters. But I guess I'm curious whether that trend back to 2019 levels have been relatively smooth on a global basis, or there's been more volatility underneath the service than we may appreciate looking at the headline numbers. So maybe if you could just frame for us how performance versus 2019 has trend over the past few months. And if you expect those trends to, and how you expect those trends to evolve over the course of the year in terms of whether it would be relatively smooth and even or lumpy with case counter vaccinations, and like I guess, ultimately, do you expect to be back to growth versus '19 when the dust settled on April? Or is that is that too ambitious?\nJamesQuincey: So the progress when you stand back and look at the numbers in aggregate, clearly, April was the deepest hole that we fell into in 2020. And then as we adapted the business, and really drove what we were doing, then, we sequentially got better. So kind of we fell into the hole, I think it was like minus 25 or something in April last year, and then it was negative teens, and then negative single digits, slowly improving through the rest of 2020 and then coming into 2021. Obviously, we then cycling the bad year, but if we compared to 2019, it got better as we went from January in February, which was still below the '19 levels. And obviously March was above, I mean, April has started well. It's obviously they are going to be the weirdest month because recycling something very low. I think most importantly, I would refer you back to the comment I made the second thing I said relative in the first answer, which is just because March has gone back to the level and just because April has started well, one week, there's no guarantee that that is then some kind of trend that is in the bank.  The principal uncertainty remains the risk of additional lockdowns. Much as 2020's numbers were heavily impacted by the degree of lockdown that will remain true this year. So whilst we've got back above the line of flotation in March, there's no guarantee there won't be some extra degree of lockdowns in May or September or December that then, puts pressure back on the business. So, I don't think I know I keep hitting this point, we had a superstar to the year, and the momentum is building. But this very unusual factor of the pandemic and the lockdowns continues to be an uncertainty factor that one can't draw a straight line through the historic data. Now, once you get under the surface of the overall global numbers, which kind of look like the kind of the tick mark if you like going down and then kind of steadily improving. Clearly, you get much more variability at a country level. Again, heavily influenced by the degree of lockdown. So in a sense, April last year was the worst because you had the most number of countries, most, the highest degree of synchronization of lockdowns globally and I think this idea of saying the recovery will be asynchronous, is we already see that in the first half, you've got countries where the vaccine levels are going up. And the reopening is occurring, US, UK, China for examples. And yet you've got countries going in exactly the opposite direction with cases shooting up, and more levels of lockdown. And that's what we're trying to highlight with this asynchronous. It may be that as a total company, it all looks smoothed out somewhat. But this asynchronous feature will be very important in 2021.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\nBonnieHerzog: All right, thank you, and good morning, everyone. I was just hoping to switch gears a little bit and maybe hear a little bit more color behind your decision to IPO Africa. I know you guys have explored a sale in the past. But why do you think, this is the right decision for that business? And then how do you expect this will impact the performance of the business going forward maybe potential benefits you might see? Thanks.\nJamesQuincey: Sure, thanks Bonnie. It means certainly, it's always been our intention to reduce our ownership in CCBA in line with our strategy, as John puts it, to become the world's smallest coke bottler. And so we were always contemplating how we would re-franchise CCBA. I mean, the CCBA, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa is a strong, well structured, capable bottler, and we have always considered as one of the options whether to have it be a free standing entity in Africa. And we have reached in inclusion that if one thinks about the future potential of the African market and the African continent, and how much long growth there is there. I mean, it is the youngest billion people are in Africa, we think it would -- we've ultimately contemplated it would be right for the development of the business in Africa to have an African headquartered African bottler that is operating on the continent. And so the read through is we believe in the future of Africa, as a continent as an economy, we think we've got a great, capable bottler that can help lead our ability to grow there. And then an IPO will allow us to set that up to be a source of growth for many years to come.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with J.P. Morgan.\nAndreaTeixeira: Thank you, operator and good morning. And so can you quantify how much the impact of the winter storms had in your volumes in Q1? And as a follow up on your comments before, can you please give us an idea how you're trending in Q2, the same way you did, it helped us in the first quarter. And just because just a quick one on US tax dispute. What is your base case in terms of the timing for the appeal at this point, and your impact on the cash flow?\nJohnMurphy: Yes. I'll take it. Maybe start with the tax question. Andrea thank you for the questions. But let's start with the tax question. In terms of to say on timing, it's -- we do not have a picture at the moment. We are dependent on the outcome of another case. Before any further developments take place with our own case. And we have no visibility into that outcome. So we'll keep you apprised as we know more. On the storms in the US, not a material impact to our business. And with regard to volumes in Q2, we're still early in the quarter and not lot to, we, not a lot to say at the moment. I think the key highlights really as we look at the downhill is the fact that March was significantly improved in a number of markets where mobility is improving and will continue I think to see a close relationship between mobility and our performance.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse.\nKaumilGajrawala: Hi. Good morning, everybody. And fantastic pronunciation, operator. I don't get that frequently. Thank you. If I may ask James and John about competition and maybe particularly in the United States, looks like Pepsi is getting some momentum. We obviously just heard from them on Friday. Here, it seems, of course, that pricing remains rational. But perhaps from competitiveness, x-pricing, maybe that's increasing. So if you could just talk about what you're seeing there would be useful. Thanks.\nJamesQuincey: Well, certainly that we're always happy to see other companies invest into the beverage industry, because that tends to create more consumer engagement. And obviously, we pay attention to what they're doing, because hopefully we can learn from them. There are a lot of very capable competitors out there. So we like to learn from them. But in the end, we focus on what we can do. And in the US in particular, channel mix aside, we gain share, we gain share going forward in beverages in the US business. And we feel confident that as the channel trends and the reopening bring back the away from home businesses, which of course they started to do in March, then we will be able to capitalize on those trends, as well. And as it relates to promotional activity, I mean, ultimately, we are seeing a kind of rational pricing and promotional environment in the US. And we'll certainly be looking to build on that with our RGM capabilities and with the bottling system to really drive and leverage the investments we're collectively making as a system in the marketing and the execution to drive the business forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.\nRobOttenstein: Great, thank you very much. Couple of questions on Topo Chico, looks like a very strong start in the US with about a 3% market share. But you started even earlier, I think in October in Mexico and Brazil, and now rolling out in Europe. Can you talk to us a little bit about how you feel about the execution of the bottling network with an adult beverage? Any signs of trends in terms of repeat and some of the earlier markets and any general learning that you've gotten so far, as you evaluate what could be a new growth engine for the company? Thank you.\nJamesQuincey: Thanks Robert. So in the markets where it's been in longer say, Latin America, and Europe, about 40 markets between them. A couple of things we're seeing, obviously, the degree of resonances is depending on the degree of category development that might already exist or not exist in some of those markets. And so we've seen different levels of engagement depending on whether the categories there or not. Secondly, I mean, we're clearly in the mode of learning how to compete in this category, both from a branding point of view and from an execution point of view. But we're definitely starting to see improving trends and good repeats in the context of the different markets where it's been launched, whether that be Latin America, or in Europe, we're still building out distribution in Mexico, for example. But we've done a good start in Europe a little easier, as I said, because the categories a bit more developed in the West versus the East. And so our focus is maximizing the amount of learning that we're doing and as it relates to the US, whilst our overall share is three and I would double underline that, Topo Chico, as a brand is well known in the US, and therefore, driving or creating trial on a well known brand with an innovation is actually relatively straightforward. The key is to repeat. And we have not yet got to the point of having good repeat data in the US having opened big caveat umbrella, I would comment that, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer might have 3% overall in the US, but actually in Texas, where we've kind of concentrated some of the launch. It's almost hit a 20 share in the first two weeks of launch. So we are encouraged by the early results, but it's all going to come down to repeat and nothing's worth anything without repeat.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevinGrundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And congratulations on a nice progress this quarter. James, I wanted to come back to your Asia Pacific business, specifically China, obviously a really strong result this comes on the heels of PepsiCo strong results in China as well. China, obviously earlier to the pandemic than other countries, and then you're seeing nice strong consumer demand here. So a few questions, please. One, can you talk about what you're seeing by channels, both at-home and away from home, maybe comment briefly on the trends in April relative to the strong results in the first quarter? And then lastly, just how the strong demand in China may be informing your view with respect to recovery in other markets? Thank you.\nJamesQuincey: Sure. Yes, clearly good results in China. We're definitely I mean, obviously, we're laughing, and we're beginning to laugh to the kind of the worst part of 2020. But ahead of 2019, we've lengthened to the reopening and the reenergizing of China with the consumer marketing with a big push into digital engagement with the consumer with a big push into e-commerce. And we are benefiting from that. It is worth noting that in terms of the channels, almost what we see, and this is true, when you look at not just China, but if you start looking at Australia or even the US you see kind of phases or waves of the reopening. And so as the reopening occurs actually get a lot of people going out to restaurants and the kind of the full service eating away. And that goes up, bearing in mind that the universe of mom and pop stores and the universe of small restaurants has shrunk people that the number of people running those sorts of businesses has shrunk.  And I think we're gonna see that all across the world. So there is a consolidation factors. And as the reopening occurs, you see a lot of going out in the evenings. So all the channels related to that come back first. The second kind of wave of improvements in channels is loosely in the bucket of office and commuting. Because as reopening happens, people go out, yet the offices aren't back at 100% capacity. So you've not got that ecosystem of commuting and lunchtime in the big city centers at full. And that's the kind of the second business coming back in China. And actually, you don't see that back yet in the US in March, you see the restaurants kind of bouncing back. But you don't see the kind of the ecosystem of commuting and offices having bounced back anywhere near the same degree. And then there's a third phase, which hasn't really happened yet. Which is kind of the large gatherings kind of phase of channels, whether that be cinemas, concerts, sporting events, et cetera, et cetera? And that's only very partial coming back. So I think, think of this kind of a set of waves of reopening as the economy normalizes. And we thought about that. And we're kind of investing both in the consumer and the bottlers are doing a great job of investing for the customers and retailers. And we're seeing a very nice result.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sean King with UBS.\nSeanKing: Hey, thanks. This happens to a number of regions, but the APAC concentrate sales came in 11 points ahead of the unit case volume. But what drove that gap besides I guess the calendar shifts? And should we expect like a reversal in this dynamic or is it something that is sort of is going to continue as we see markets reopen?\nJamesQuincey: So for APAC, just specifically on your question, yes. APAC has run ahead, mainly due to the extra days in the quarter. And we also had a timing impact with regard to Chinese New Year in China, obviously. And so but for the quarter overall you saw gallons running ahead, mainly due to the extra days in the quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim.\nLaurentGrandet: Yes, very nice pronunciation as well. So good morning, everyone. Yes, so I'd like to focus on emerging markets. So you said in your prepared remark that the volume case is correlated to the consumer mobility driven by vaccination rates. So, as I call into the video show, I mean, vaccination rates should be about 70% by the end of the year in developed market, but sadly, just about 20% in emerging markets. So should we consider then that emerging markets would be slower to recover? And really, probably, if you can provide some significant thought there, and maybe some granularity between that between regions? Thank you.\nJamesQuincey: Sure. So, I think, as you say, clearly, the vaccination rates in the developed markets are going to be ahead of the developing markets for the duration of this year. The critical factor to add to that is the market response to the level of cases or the low vaccination rates in the developing markets, because the thing that impacts our business most directly is the degree of lockdown. And so it's the response to the level of cases of the COVID and the resulting lockdowns, rather than necessarily directly the level of vaccination, because there are countries where the level of vaccination is low, because they had a strong lockdown, and then kind of lock the country up, say, Australia, whatever, then they've started to reopen. So the key factor to look for is the degree of lockdown and think through for that market, what's likely to happen, connected, of course, to the level of vaccinations, but also to the level of cases and what the policy response in the country is likely to be. And there'll be countries where I think, frankly, and unfortunately, they don't have the wherewithal and the fiscal capacity to implement large lockdowns, even if they not got all the vaccines that they want. And the markets remain open. And of course, we will look for ways to adapt the business to support the people, support the retailers and continue to engage with consumers as that goes on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with Truist Securities.\nBillChappell: Thanks, good morning. Hey, just want to follow up. And this is fairly near term and acute to the US, but I'm just trying to understand kind of the commentary of how you're looking at the business in that. I mean, it seems that the US will be different in kind of the reopening of everywhere else. So high majority of the population will be inoculated in the next 30 days, just as schools are getting out just as the weather's getting good. You have kind of sporting events talking about full capacity in June. I mean, are you -- is that a scenario you're prepared for and the bottling network is prepared for if the business, the on-premise business just explodes? And or do you really think that this is just going to be kind of go from phase two to phase three in May in phase four in June and slowly going to open up over the summer?\nJamesQuincey: What I think the phases are going to exist, Bill, there are just going to happen very quickly in the US. So if I look at what's already happening I put eating and drinking in the evening in kind of phase one. I mean, those that bit of the away from home was trending negative, in volume strongly negative in volume in January and February. And as the reopening happened, it jumps up in March. And as you say, as school, as education and at work opens, both of which are still running negative in March, I think they're going to jump up again. So what I think we're going to see, as the US completes its kind of rapid vaccination is a quick succession of the phases rather than a drawn out set of the phases. Other parts of the world where the vaccination programs are slower, then I think you'll see a more gradual phasing of what happens. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.\nJames Quincey: Okay, so thanks very much, everyone. It's certainly been great talking to you all. We had an excellent first quarter very encouraging. Still many of the parts of the world yet to emerge from the pandemic. But as we navigate this kind of dynamic environment, we will continue to evolve and do better. And we are well positioned to the recovery as it plays out both as an organization and as a system. And as always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company, and for joining us today. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing first, and then reenter the queue. Now, let me turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. 2022 was a strong year for us. We executed well and grew amidst a challenging macro environment. We did this in part by focusing on expanding the sphere of what we can control. We delivered on our top line and bottom line guidance, and we continue to create value by investing in our loved brands, even as we faced a very dynamic backdrop. Today, I'll reflect on our fourth quarter and the year's performance and set the stage for 2023. I'll also share how we're operating differently today, which makes us confident in our ability to deliver our 2023 guidance, and well equipped for a future that continues to be volatile and uncertain. John will then discuss our results and our 2023 outlook in more detail. During the fourth quarter, the environment remained dynamic as inflation, geopolitical tensions, pandemic-related mobility restrictions and currency volatility persisted. Despite this range of factors, consumer demand held up relatively well, and our industry remains strong. In the fourth quarter, we remain focused on our growth strategy and continued to create value for our consumers and customers. We maintained agility to navigate this challenging environment and delivered 15% organic revenue growth in the quarter, with strong growth across operating segments. This was driven by pricing actions across markets and revenue growth management initiatives to retain and add consumers. While we saw robust volume growth across many markets, this was more than offset by the suspension of our business in Russia and the impact on consumption, driven by varying levels of pandemic-related mobility restrictions and the surge in COVID cases in China. Overall, throughout 2022, we have maintained consistent volume growth relative to 2019. We've gained both volume and value share for the consolidated business for both the quarter and the year. So far, in 2023, the volume growth trends versus 2019 are in line with last year, and we are laser-focused on executing on our growth plans. Our streamlined portfolio of global and local brands and stepped-up consumer-facing investments continue to fuel the competitive edge of the Coca-Cola system to deliver value in any environment. Our network organizational structure enables this strategy. We've connected our operating units, our functions and our platform services organization for strong end-to-end coordination, which helps us identify key opportunities for meaningful long-term growth. And on top of this, we remain well aligned with our bottling partners, which further builds on our strength as a network system. As we look to 2023, many uncertainties remain in the macro economy, whether from economic policies, consumer demand, inflation, supply chain, war and geopolitics. Instead of trying to forecast and predict the many directions things could move, we are focused on delivering on our key objectives: firstly, pursuing excellence globally and winning locally through relentless consumer centricity to continue the top line momentum; secondly, investing for the long-term health of the business and raising the bar across all elements of our strategic flywheel; thirdly, generating US dollar EPS growth to deliver value for our shareowners. We continue to build the right capabilities and strengthen the system alignment to deliver in a dynamic world, and we continue to invest to raise the bar. We are executing more efficiently and effectively on a local level while maintaining flexibility on a global level. Throughout 2022, we saw many examples of harnessing our enhanced capabilities to win locally. Our new marketing model is working. We've linked occasions and passion points to drive engagement. We're experimenting to optimize marketing. This is driving deeper connections with consumers, reaching them in unique and new ways. We are tying our beverages to consumption occasions and engaging consumers through local experiences. For example, in Vietnam, to support the reopening of away-from-home accounts, we launched the pilot of Coke is Cooking campaign in October. In this month-long campaign to help drive traffic back to stores, we partner with more than 700 food shops. We created thousands of food and Coke combo deals that consumers purchased at these food shops, along with Coke is Cooking merchandising and digital support by our local influencers. This was the first time we used an on-ground event as a commercial asset, creating a social and digital content generator. The campaign resulted in more than 1 million combo transactions and 20% uplift for participating merchants. We're leveraging passion points locally to create immersive experiences and drive consumption. For example, in Latin America, our live music strategy created memorable in-person and digital experiences, elevating consumer engagement. We partnered with Rock in Rio, one of the biggest music festivals in the world, and created new opportunities for consumers to access content through live streams and in the metaverse. As a result, we boosted our reach from approximately 700,000 attendees to more than 45 million consumers across the region, and our sales inside the festival increased 23% versus the last festival. In India, the Thums Up, Stump Cam was a never before seen activation for cricket fans where consumers could scan a QR code on product label and get access to exclusive match moments of the ICC T20 Cricket World Cup through a camera installed on one of the wickets. Throughout the 45-day tournament, we use first-party data and artificial intelligence to send personalized content to consumers based on their favorite matches, and we amplified the experience through sports influencers. This campaign showed strong results with Thums Up growing volume ahead of our total sparkling portfolio in India during the activation period, contributing to strong volume growth for Thums Up for the full year. This drove about 1/4 of India's total volume growth for the year. Thums Up also experienced its highest monthly market share jump during the activation period. We are driving consumer interest and action through digital experiences using the power of partnerships across platforms. For example, in Germany, we partnered with our key online customer and created voice-based branded experiences with its voice assistant to drive engagement and grow positive brand perception. This allowed consumers to learn more about Coca-Cola products and shop on voice assistant-enabled devices using only their voice. The campaign delivered strong results with a reach of 11 million impressions. Additionally, consumers that engaged with its voice-based experience had a 25% add-to-cart rate. And lastly, we're delivering new and unexpected innovation by leveraging Gen Z insights. In the US, we launched Minute Maid Aguas Frescas. The product is made with real fruit juices, is noncarbonated and comes in three exciting flavors. It was originally available as a limited launch in 16-ounce ready-to-drink cans. A disruptive end-to-end digital media marketing campaign created early momentum, which led us to quickly scale this experiment to our Freestyle platform and other fountain offerings. In 2022, the product had a 60% repeat rate and won the Best New Product award from Convenience Store News. We have been building our revenue growth management and execution capabilities for many years, and we've made good progress, as shown by our ability to offset much of the inflation we saw in 2022 and delivered strong volume and transaction growth. There is still much work to be done to maximize revenue by further segmenting our markets and consumers based on additional variables. We are leveraging digital and data-backed insights to better understand our consumers. This will help drive affordable propositions for basket incidence growth and recruit new drinkers. It will also lead to premiumization to drive price and mix. For example, in Europe, we grew both volume and value share for the last year. We partnered with key customers to drive growth through affordability and premiumization initiatives that tapped into the key consumption occasions of meals and breaks. This end-to-end execution resulted in higher basket incidents and buying households across all key channels in Europe. Globally, this strong system execution focus generated 80 million additional shopping trips for our products and added 17 million households to our base. Through our stepped-up capabilities, we are getting better at synchronizing demand creation and demand fulfillment, driving top-tier value creation for our customers. We measure success by the value we create for our stakeholders and by how we are creating a better shared future for people, communities and the planet. During 2022, we made progress across these sustainability priorities. We leveraged our marketing power to drive growth of our low- and no-calorie beverages and continue to provide smaller package choices to enable consumers to manage sugar intake. Approximately two-thirds of the products in our portfolio have less than 100 calories per 12-ounce serving. On packaging, we've set a new industry-leading goal to have 25% of our volume globally being refillable or reusable packaging by 2030. Additionally, we are continuing to increase cooler energy efficiency and the use of HFC free coolers to make progress on our science-based targets, while creating a clear road map with our system and suppliers to achieve our carbon emissions reduction ambition. On water, as part of our 2030 water security strategy, we stepped up investments in nature-based water solutions exemplified by the work we're doing with the Nature Conservancy and other partners. Globally, we are working to strengthen the links between replenishment projects and nature-based solutions. We further embedded sustainability into our strategy by linking diversity equity inclusion performance measures to our executive annual incentive program and by linking water and our PET packaging measures to our executives' long-term incentive program. Overall, we continue to focus on using our leadership and scale to drive change while delivering results and building resilience. Finally, before I hand it over to John, I want to acknowledge that our strong results in 2022 reflect the collective efforts of our system partners and the growth mindset of our system employees. Guided by our purpose, we are investing behind our capabilities and further cultivating our growth mindset to be well positioned to create value and deliver on our objectives. While we have momentum in our business, we know uncertainty remains as we turn the page to a new year. We will continue to focus on expanding the sphere of what we can control to drive growth in 2023 and beyond. We'll talk about this in more detail when we return to CAGNY in person next Tuesday and would encourage all of you to listen in. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we continued to drive strong top line-led results as we execute for growth in a dynamic operating environment. We grew organic revenues 15%. Unit cases declined 1% as broad-based growth across most markets and investments in the marketplace were more than offset by the suspension of business in Russia and the decline in China. Concentrate sales were 3 points ahead of unit cases for the quarter, primarily driven by one additional day and the timing of concentrate shipments. Our price/mix growth of 12% was driven by pricing actions across operating segments along with revenue growth management initiatives and favorable channel and package mix. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 90 basis points versus the prior year, mainly driven by currency headwinds in a volatile macro backdrop and the mechanical effect of consolidating the BODYARMOR finished goods business. Underlying gross margin was in line with the prior year, driven by strong organic revenue growth offset by higher commodity costs. We continued to significantly accelerate our marketing investments to engage and retain existing consumers as well as, again, new consumers. Despite higher costs across the P&L, increased marketing and currency headwinds, comparable operating margin expanded 65 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by underlying operating margin expansion due to robust top line growth across operating segments. Importantly, this resulted in full year comparable operating margin be in line with the prior year despite significant currency acquisition and cost headwinds. Below the line, we were impacted by higher net interest expense, along with lower other income due to cycling higher pension income from the prior year. Therefore, fourth quarter comparable EPS of $0.45 was in line with last year despite higher-than-expected currency headwinds. This resulted in full year comparable EPS of $2.48, an increase of 7% versus the prior year, driven by strong underlying business performance, partially offset by 10 points of currency headwinds. For the year, we delivered free cash flow of $9.5 billion, a decline of 15% versus the prior year. Much of the decline versus our expectations occurred due to the deliberate buildup of inventory in the face of a volatile commodity environment and higher-than-anticipated tax payments. Additionally, cash flow was impacted by cycling working capital benefits from the prior year and higher incentive payments in 2022. Even with these items, our underlying cash flow generation remains strong, and we continue to make progress on our cash flow agenda. Our three-year average free cash flow conversion ratio is above 100%, ahead of our long-term target. Our balance sheet remains strong with our net debt leverage of 1.8 times EBITDA as of the end of 2022, which is below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same, and we continue to prioritize investing in the business to drive long-term growth, as well as delivering dividend growth for our shareowners. At the same time, we remain mindful of maintaining our financial flexibility amidst the ongoing tax dispute with the IRS and are learning from the last few years of how important it is to build resilience in all of our plans. As James mentioned, in 2023, we expect the operating environment to remain dynamic. We have the right portfolio, a very focused strategy, a flexible and adaptable structure and a system with the ability to reinvest in the business. This gives us the confidence that we will continue to deliver on our three key objectives, pursuing excellence globally, and winning locally; investing for the long-term health of the business; generating US dollar EPS growth. With that in mind, this morning, we provided guidance for 2023 that builds on our strong results in 2022. We expect organic revenue growth of 7% to 8%, primarily led by price/mix amidst the ongoing inflationary environment. And we expect comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 7% to 9% versus 2022. Since we provided our initial outlook on currency in October, the currency environment has improved, but remains volatile. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate two to three-point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate three to four-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023. Based on current rates and hedge positions, we expect per-case commodity price inflation in the range of a mid-single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2023. We continue to expect our underlying effective tax rate to be 19.5% for 2023. And all in, we expect comparable earnings per share growth of 4% to 5% versus $2.48 in 2022. We expect to generate approximately $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2023 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations less approximately $1.9 billion in capital investments. I would like to highlight that included in the $11.4 billion of cash from operations are two discrete items: transition tax payments of approximately $720 million; a scheduled increase of $335 million versus 2022; payments associated with various M&A transactions of approximately $350 million. Excluding these, our implied free cash flow conversion would be within our long-term guidance. This guidance does not include any payments related to our ongoing US income tax dispute with the IRS. Recently, the tax court issued an opinion on a case involving a separate company. The tax court will now apply this opinion to our case and ultimately render a final decision in our case, allowing us to move forward with the appeals process. As previously discussed, we intend to assert our claims on appeal, vigorously defend our position and believe we will ultimately prevail. Overall, we don't expect this to have a bearing on our ability to deliver on our capital allocation agenda and drive long-term business growth. There are some considerations to keep in mind for 2023. We expect price mix to moderate through the year as we cycle our pricing initiatives from the prior year. While the inflationary environment appears to be cooling, we are still expecting to see elevated inflation, across our operating costs. We have stepped up our marketing investments for the last few years and we will continue to invest to support momentum. And given the ongoing backdrop of rising interest rates, we expect to see higher net interest expense given our effective exposure to floating rate debt. Finally, due to our reporting calendar, there will be one less day in the first quarter and one additional day in the fourth quarter. Having delivered strong results in 2022, we are focused on driving a top line-led growth equation in many types of environments. We are well positioned to deliver on guidance for 2023, thanks to the incredible people we have around the world, the strong alignment we have with our bottling partners and the great plans we have for the coming year. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks, good morning. I guess in light of John's comment, just have a top line led growth equation. I was hoping you could talk a little bit through the outlook for 2023 on top line just kind of puts and takes how you think about that 7 to 8 relative to the mid-teens put up in the fourth quarter and just kind of more color overall on that revenue outlook for this year would be great? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yeah, sure. Good morning, Lauren. Firstly, as John said, we feel confident about our outlook to drive the year from the top line. Let me connect that perhaps starting to 2022. As we commented, we saw steady volume growth through the year, including the fourth quarter. I know we reported a headline number of minus one. But if you accommodate the suspension of Russia and the COVID restrictions in China and take a three-year CAGR of volume growth, you see a pretty constant growth momentum through the year. And we would also comment that, that growth momentum has continued into the beginning of 2023. So we see strong underlying volume momentum or ongoing volume momentum that we have been able to achieve by our focus on the marketing innovation, the RGM and the execution to accommodate the need for affordability and premiumization in the face of inflation. And as John commented, we do see both inflation moderating as we go through 2023 and of course, our own pricing PMO beginning to moderate as we go through '23 in part because, the input costs inflation is moderating, but also because we begin to cycle some of the price increases from 2022. And what that's likely to net out as obviously, we've given a seven to eight for the full year. And what we're likely to see is the beginning of the Q1, we're likely to see revenue growth more close to what -- the sort of levels we were achieving coming out of last year. And that then logically, the organic growth rate moderates as we get towards the end of the year, looking to close out on a more normalized level of revenue growth. And then when you average that out, you get to the seven to eight. So, I think we're going to see good momentum through the year, moderating revenue growth rate as a function of moderating inflation ultimately. And what will remain is a good, strong underlying momentum of our business that has been powering the last five years, and we are confident we'll continue to power the years ahead at the sort of level of top line relative to the long-term growth model that we have previously talked about.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Okay. Just a quick -- just clarifying point on that, I apologize. So, just to think about volumes and whether you want to talk about it in terms of concentrate sales or unit case volume, do you still expect growth in the second half of the year from a volume standpoint, or do you expect, not still, do you expect?\nJames Quincey: Yes. So look, the long-term -- firstly, we had good growth last year, and we started the year with growth in unit case growth, obviously with PMO. As we look forward, what's normal on our revenue growth rate, we have called out, we expect to get a balance of the growth between unit cases and price/ mix on an ongoing basis. Exactly how that turns out in the second half will depend on the environment or the dynamics and whether inflation does moderate, how much pressure the consumer does come under. Our central view is we will continue to see unit case growth in the second half, combined with price/mix moderating, as I talked about, as the organic -- overall organic trend. But our focus remains executing against our plan. And obviously, that involves not just a focus on the marketing and the innovation. But within the RGM, we have, as one of our objectives, to maintain consumers within our franchise by leveraging our pricing and packaging strategies to support affordability around the world to keep the lower -- perhaps lower-income consumers in the franchise, which, of course, is to some extent an underpinning on volume. We prefer that as a strategy than to have more price and less volume. So again, our central view is to see continued level of unit case growth in the second half with obviously a moderating price mix to get to the overall revenue. But we're going to manage the business. In the end, we don't know exactly what's going to happen. There are lots of scenarios as to how this might play out, but we're confident we can drive the momentum of the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning, guys. So just a follow-up on that, James, can you give us a little bit of detail regionally on expectations for 2023? I know you're not going to quantify it, but just how you're thinking about the business conceptually relative to the results you delivered in Q4 here and take us around the world regionally? And then I guess just, secondly, if I can slip a clarification in, you're obviously starting off the year with top line guidance higher than you typically do, higher than long-term algorithm, higher than you started 2022 at despite delivering great results in 2022. It's a less visible world in theory externally. So I guess it sounded more like a good start so far this year. You have a lot of visibility given that, and that's what's driving some of that confidence, but I'd love to hear from your vantage point what sort of gives you the confidence there? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I'll take that in reverse order, Dara. We'll count that as two halves of a question rather than two questions. Let me give you another way of thinking about 2023 because I agree, there is a good deal of uncertainty on how this might play out. But there's been a tremendous amount of volatility and uncertainty over the last five years or four years. If you were to take a compound annual growth rate of unit cases and price/mix over the last, I don't know, four or five years and look at that number, I think you'd end up with something around two on volume and four or five on price. So you could look back and say, wow, we were on a crazy ride there. But in the end, we've got a good number. And so I look at 2023, so yes, something unexpected is bound to happen. But as we have expanded our ability to influence our own business, we have been adaptable in the face of all sorts of circumstances and being able to deliver the results we want, which is winning locally and turning that into our US dollar EPS growth. And so that's what gives us the confidence. We don't know what's going to happen, but we do know we've generated a lot of momentum, a lot of flexibility and a lot of agility to be able to manage through what's going to come at us. And so that's really the source of the confidence rather than being able to say we know what the future holds entirely. And as we look around the world, taking the various different pieces, starting in Europe perhaps or in EMEA, clearly, Europe is under some more pressure. The impacts of the conflict drove a much greater spike in -- short-term spike in inflation. That's playing itself through. It looks like the European economies are going to avoid a technical recession, but clearly, consumer demand is softening, and I think that's likely to continue into the rest of the year. And looking at the other markets in EMEA, if you're a resource seller, you're doing well. If you're a resource buyer, you're under more pressure. Obviously, Turkey, tragic situation with the earthquake, but also the economy has been under pressure already. So the emerging markets there are a full range. And similarly, in Africa, South Africa is important to us. They've got a very big problem in terms of energy, which is hampering the economic growth. So, there's more pressure in EMEA. The US continues to be strong. We've got momentum in the business on the top line, doing well. The situation seems to be moderating without causing a hard landing. As of yet, we expect to see the pressure to continue to moderate, but the economy and the consumption, at least of beverages, continues to be good. Latin America, similarly, there's been -- obviously, there's some places which continue to have very high inflation and the economic problems like the Argentinas of the world. But Latin America is doing well. And then out to Asia, obviously, the reopening of China is going to be a positive for the business, certainly on a cycle basis. India is flying. ASEAN, we expect come back up as those two large economies do well, and we think that will also do well for Japan. So we see both a continued acceleration or continued growth in a number of markets, some doing really well, but the general context being a moderation of the inflation. And then the zillion dollar question always comes back to is the process of bringing inflation down going to be hard, soft or perfect landing, and that we will see.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks, operator. Good morning. Just a question for John. I guess two -- just related to cash flow and interest expense. I know you talked about net interest expense being up for the year in '23. Can you just give us a little bit more detail in terms of -- I think consensus is sitting at like $600 million for net interest. So just, if you could give us a little more help in terms of where we should be on net interest expense. And then on free cash flow, you talked about the drivers that knock it down in '23. Would we expect that, as we kind of go into '24, '25, like that should normalize? So is this more kind of contained within this year and then you expect to normalize going forward? Thank you.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Bryan. Let me start the second question. The key drivers for '23, we have on top of underlying -- strong underlying performance, we'll have two significant buckets. One is we are stepping up our capital investments to support the growth agenda in a number of our operations around the world. And so that's a $400 million increase in '23. And then we have approximately $700 million related to an uptick in the transition tax and some M&A-related initiatives. So for 2024, we'll continue to invest in the business as the business needs, especially when it comes to providing capital for our growth plans. The transition tax goes up a couple of hundred million in 2024. That will be the second last year of the transition tax date that ends in 2025. So you can do the math on the variance that's gone in from 2023 to 2024. We expect the underlying performance to continue. We'll invest as we need to in the business to support the growth agenda. And we do have, I'd say, a couple of hundred million extra in 2024 million under transition tax. And then with regard to interest, yeah, as we've highlighted, we -- with our current debt portfolio, we will see an uptick in 2023 in interest charges and interest -- sorry, interest expense. And I'm not going to go into the specific numbers, but you can expect a couple of points of deleverage primarily driven by interest expense as we navigate through this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSteve Powers: Yes. Hey, good morning. Thank you. James, maybe going back to the top line. For a while, you've been making simultaneous efforts to drive both affordability, on the one hand, and then premiumization on the other hand, and I think doing a good job along the way, balancing those, in some ways, competing efforts to net out in a way that ends up in both positive volume and positive price/mix territory. I guess the question is, as you as you look at 2023, do you see more opportunity in your efforts to optimize revenue growth on the value side and the affordability side, or is it on the premiumization side? And to the extent that there's a leaning, how does that impact where you prioritize incremental investments?\nJames Quincey: Yeah. Thanks, Steve. Absolutely, we see opportunities in 2023 and, frankly, beyond to continue to leverage the capability around RGM to both use affordability to keep typically lower income consumers enacted and engaged with our brand franchises whilst also pursuing premiumization. And then it's going to be dynamic implementation as we go forward. We're going to see continuations into 2023 of different sorts of packaging options, whether they be drives around returnables, whether they be drives, which obviously tend, given the economics of returnables to have lower price points, whether you see, for example, in emerging markets, the greater use of 1-liter packaging instead of larger packaging for at-home occasions, we're going to continue to see a lot of opportunity to push forward right across the world with affordability options. And given that they tend to be dilutive to margins, we also look for all those consumer opportunities for premiumization, whether it be directly a brand launch. I mean things like the Jack and Coke will be accretive to revenue, or directly within some of our brands to use the sleek cans and the smaller cans to kind of put more premium packaging into the marketplace. It will be an ongoing -- ongoing effort, and we don't see the runway of that running out anytime soon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nNik Modi: Thanks. Good morning everyone. I just -- James, I just wanted to follow up on the last question regarding all the affordability packaging. Just based on the historical kind of observations across the world, how does it work with retail? I mean are these incremental phasings you're getting, or is it replacing older pack sizes that might have a lot more type sensitivity?\nJames Quincey: It can be both, Nik. And obviously, it depends whether we're talking about supermarkets, convenience stores or small mom-and-pops. The more we're talking about smaller stores or convenience or the mom-and-pops, the more it is replacement. Obviously, we make a big focus even in those smaller formats to gain incremental space, whether it'd be in the coal vaults or on the floor with our own coolers and our own racks. That absolutely does increase the beverage category phasings. But there's nothing wrong in any given store with looking at the SKU layout and saying, look, I'm going to take some of these SKUs and make them -- replace them with more affordable SKUs. And I'm going to take some of them and put more premium options in such that the total mix works not just for us, but also for the customer and, ultimately, for the consumer. It's got to work for the consumer. Otherwise, it's not going to rotate faster than the setup that's already in there because in the end, the customer is going to support these strategies because it works for them, because it works for the consumer, and everyone is better off with the implementation. So, yes, a mix of incremental versus cannibalized phasings, ultimately, by focusing on the consumer, you get a better answer for them, that creates a better answer for the customer, that creates a better answer for the coke system.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping you could provide a little more color on your plans for reinvestments this year and then maybe frame for us whether it will be stepped up versus last year. Also, how are you thinking about your marketing spend this year? Do you also have plans for that to accelerate? I guess, I'm ultimately trying to understand, how much flexibility you have to balance the momentum. You're certainly seeing in your business with reinvesting, while at the same time, letting some of the strength flow to the bottom line. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. We're clearly going to, as we have in 2021 and 2022, have a bias to invest for growth. That's our starting point. And as we demonstrated in the early years of the pandemic, if we see overall or in any specific countries that, that allocation towards driving growth is inappropriate at some sort of level, we've demonstrated the ability to act quickly to redirect the money either somewhere else or to let it go to the bottom line. So we're going to use all the data we get in from the field to be very dynamic in our resource allocation. We largely feel, we have achieved an appropriate level of marketing. Yes, that's going to increase in 2023 because we're growing the business in the same way, as John mentioned, we're going to increase our CapEx to support the bits of the business where CapEx needs to flow. But we are going to manage all of this with an agile hand depending on the circumstances. We talked in the answer -- the answers to the other questions that we don't know what the year will hold. We have a central view that it's growth-orientated, the balances, volume and price that accommodates different pressures around the world and different speeds of moderation of inflation, but it's a bias towards growth, and we will be fast and adaptable in the face of anything different.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hey, good morning, everybody. Can you maybe touch on briefly what you're seeing from the retail environment? We're seeing more and more articles on retailers pushing back on price increases across really all of CPG. If you could maybe just give us a sense of what you're seeing in your categories?\nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean, first, one has to kind of break down the, global dynamic because each major region or each country is a different place. But let me start with the central idea that we pursue, which is we need to earn the right pay price. It's not our strategy to think of our business as commoditized where prices just flow up and down in a kind of mechanical way. We need to own our pricing by delivering for the consumers value that they appreciate through the marketing, through the innovation, through the RGM, the pricing and packaging work, through the execution such that they see value in our brands that can sustain the pricing that the input costs are driving us towards. And that ultimately then has to work for the customers. And because it has to work for the consumers, it then flows down the customers. So we've earned the right to price with the consumers. Then we can go to our customer partners and say, 'Look, we think that we can lead the beverage category to grow faster than your business.' Yes, we believe we're going to be more competitive because we understand the consumers and we're going to gain share, but we can lead the beverage category, deliver more growth for you and be a disproportionate share of your rate revenue growth relative to other categories,' which is what, for example, was demonstrated last year in Europe, where I think we led -- we added more revenue growth than any other system for retailers in Europe last year. And that is the platform on which we then fold in the conversations around pricing and packaging for any given year. So yes, of course, there's pressure in the marketplace. But in the end, we have an approach we believe, is consumer-centric and that drives growth for the customers because they also want to keep the consumers too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChris Carey: Hi. Good morning. So clearly, the past several years have had big variability in your channel and package mix within the overall price/mix equation with mobility constraints and sharp recoveries thereafter. Just taking John's commentary on a price-driven year for next year, James talking about still \u2013 volume will still be a factor, I guess, what I'm wondering is just underlying what's in that price/mix, whether you think channel and package mix have normalized, right? Said another way, there's \u2013 we're not really talking about recoveries in those line items and what's going forward will be kind of more offensive or growing from a normalized base. And so do you think you're back to that normalized base on \u2013 from a channel and package mix from which to grow? And then in 2023, do you have any thoughts on what the contribution is from price relative to channel or package mix? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: So firstly, in any given country, channel mix has largely recovered 2019 levels. Yes, there are some exceptions like China, which is only just now reopening, and a couple of other countries. And when I say, largely normalized, if you take something like the US, clearly, there are a number of away-from-home outlets that have dropped out of the marketplace. So there's a tail or there's a last piece of the recovery channel that is not going to happen overnight and may not happen for some time to come. But in headline terms, other than a little bit of positive channel effect perhaps in the first half, I think we can put a line on the channel mix being \u2013 or the recovery of the channel mix relative to the pandemic being a major driver of price/mix going forward. Yes, package mix will continue to be a factor, as it has been in previous years and prior to the pandemic, Clearly, as we pursue a dual strategy of keeping consumers in this franchise with affordability and looking for premiumization opportunities, the two can somewhat offset each other, one's dilutive, one's accretive, but they're both valuable strategies that need to taken forward. So I think predominantly, what you're going to see in 2023 is the ongoing moderation of rate pricing, both as we cycle rate increases or price increases from 2022 and as inflation in general and inflation specifically to us, whether it be in SG&A, or in commodities begins to moderate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlos Laboy from HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nCarlos Laboy: Yes. Good morning, everyone. The Latin American bottlers keep guiding for stepped-up investments in traditional trade DSD capabilities to fully exploit this new cooperation framework they have with your firm. Do you think, this is already kicking into the systems financial performance and the model, in your view, adaptable to other parts of the world where the promise of maybe higher ROIC and stepped-up bottling CapEx, can drive system growth?\nJames Quincey: Yeah. Let me take that in parts. The features that we have in the long-term relationship model in Latin America, we're rolling those out in a number of other places. And clearly, the more we can intensify whatever the framework gets called, the degree of alignment towards investing to capture the opportunities in the marketplace, the better off we're going to be, us and our bottling partners, in any given geography. So absolutely, we continue to see opportunities to work even closer together to capture opportunities in the marketplace. The nature of those investments, the nature of the opportunity are not exactly the same as Latin America. Clearly, the trade structure differs around the world. Latin America has a number of particular features that not necessarily replicated in the US or Europe or Japan, for example. But the overall concept of a tighter longer term investment focus on the opportunities is really going to drive -- continue to drive performance into the future years. And I think, in Latin America, we've got a great business there collectively as a system because we focused on investing into the marketplace and into the traditional trade for a very long time, along with all the other customers in Latin America. But there are still plenty of opportunities to go both from the top line and from the point of view of improving returns. So I think you'll find or everyone will find that the Latin American bottlers, as bottlers around the world are -- that we see a lot -- collectively, we see a lot of opportunities ahead of us to drive the top line and to continue to improve returns on the bottling assets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you, operator, and good morning. James, as we think about the 7% to 8% organic sales growth guidance, what is the price/mix carryover into 2023? You said it, obviously, will moderate, but what is -- are you embedding any additional pricing that is not in the trade yet? And how are you planning for China volumes in 2023? What is the benefit from there, or any mix dynamics we should be aware of? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yeah. So we're certainly planning for China to become more normalized, reopening ala the US and Europe. And so we will see a more normal level of volume in China and a recovery to the 2019 or growth on the 2019 numbers as time come through as we go through the year in China. And then in terms of the carryover, clearly, there's some carryover, particularly in the first half from 2022. But we will be taking pricing in 2023. Now having said we will be taking pricing, the world is very different. I mean, there are countries where inflation is well over 50%. So pricing is taken multiple times a year. Argentina is an obvious example. So in the developed markets, it's likely we'll trend more back towards more standard cycles of pricing, but there will be price increases across the world in 2023 to reflect both the continuing inflation in import and SG&A costs. Obviously, we need to, as I talked about in the previous answer, earn the right to that pricing, but there will be pricing in 2023.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much and congratulations on a terrific year. So over the last few years, James, you and your team have made significant cultural changes, organizational changes, changes to the product portfolio. As you look at 2023, what are the key initiatives that you're looking to drive to set up for continued strong growth over the next decade or so longer-term and perhaps weaved into that answer, where things are on Costa, on BODYARMOR and on any other new initiatives that you think would be helpful to discuss? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Great. Thanks, Rob. And certainly, we will unpack a little more of this at the CAGNY presentation and the CAGNY conversation. So I'm sure I won't do full justice to the question in this session.  In terms of the initiatives in the marketplace, we have an aspiration of being a total beverage company everywhere. That's not going to happen overnight. And so we need to make progress in a disciplined way in different category, country combinations, as we've talked about, to establish leadership positions, preferably quality leadership positions, in the next set of country category combinations on our journey to the total aspiration. And within that, there are ones that are off to the races and flying away. And there are ones where we still need to demonstrate to ourselves we can execute against the vision. If I take the two you called out, Costa, BODYARMOR, to start with, the essential thesis behind coffee remains the same. It's a huge market. It's growing. There's lots of money in it. If we can find a path, there's a tremendous growth opportunity for the Coke system there. We've got a vision. The reality is timing was very unfortunate getting it just before the pandemic. In strategic terms, despite all the experimentation, despite all the learning, despite all the initial steps, in big strategic terms, we haven't advanced because, essentially, COVID put it on hold for three years. We now need to get the execution ramped up for cost against the vision and in the coming years demonstrate that, that holds water. BODYARMOR, great job. We obviously incorporated that into the company last year. And I think we -- whilst we always expect some level of disruption as we move a business that has been grown quickly and prepared for sale by the founders into the Coke system, there's often some disruption in the short-term. But frankly, I think there was more in 2022 than we would -- than we expected or would have liked. But we have a good plan going forward in 2023 that will kind of reset BODYARMOR on a good path and in a complementary way to Powerade. Other initiatives, which we're looking very interested in the degree of traction in some of the alcohol experiments, particularly looking to see Jack and Coke do well. Early data in Mexico launched at the end of last year was encouraging ahead of expectations. The US launch will be very interesting at the end of March. And all of that will be backed up by the continued work on the culture and organization, whilst it will never -- nothing ever settles. It never ends. But I think, really, it's about continuing to stand up and execute against the internal initiatives we've already launched. The organization is coming together. We made a few tweaks in North America coming into the year, but the organization is getting up and running and starting to harm. The marketing model change is starting to show good results and promise. So, I think, it's a question of seeing through the things we've launched to really up our game in the coming years.\nOperator: Our last question today will come from Charlie Higgs from Redburn. Please, go ahead. Your line is open.\nCharlie Higgs: Hi, James, John. I hope you\u2019re both well. My final question is just on India, where it looks like it's had just a record year. Could you maybe just expand a little bit more on India? Is it still being driven by the affordable price point strategy? Are you adding distribution that means, maybe this volume growth is actually sustainable over the long term? And then, James, maybe you could just give us some color on your long-term view on India. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yes. India had a cracking year last year and is off to a strong start this year. I think, the -- our overall backdrop to this is, firstly, that the Indian economy and the Indian consumer base is approaching, in highest level terms, a level of GDP per head, at which historically, the beverage industry has tended to accelerate its development. And so, we are very encouraged by the potential in India to develop a fantastic beverage industry and beverage opportunity. I mean, ultimately, the development of industry is very nascent in India, and there's a huge potential to build the industry over many decades. And so, that's being driven, not just by the affordable entry price points, although they are growing. Really, it's a question of actually everything. It's growing on all dimensions. It's growing in terms of the depth of the different brands. It's growing in distribution. It's growing in number of packages. And so, I think, there's a huge long potential in India. It won't, in all likelihood, be a straight line, but there is huge potential in India. And really in a way, India exemplifies the very long-term opportunity of a whole set of emerging markets, India, Africa, parts of Eurasia, parts of ASEAN to actually -- they themselves have 80% of the world's population. And the development of the beverage industry is a-third of what it is in the developed market. They only pay for about I think 3 in 10 of the commercial beverages, which is -- or 2 in 10 of the commercial beverage, whereas 7 in 10 in the developed ones. So India typifies the long-term potential of the beverage industry to keep growing. And I think it's a market that is set to take off.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.\nJames Quincey: Thank you, operator. So to summarize, we have momentum in our business. We're winning in the marketplace, sustainability embedded in our strategies and strong alignment with our bottling partners. We are pursuing excellence in brand building, innovation, revenue growth management and execution to add and retain consumers and drive long-term value for our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning. Thank you.\nOperator: Gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We posted schedules under Financial Information in the Investors section of our company website at coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our gross and operating margins.

Following prepared remarks, we will turn the call over for questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing first, and then reenter the queue. Now, let me turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey : Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. After a strong first half of the year, we continued our momentum in the third quarter with effective execution across our global system despite a macro backdrop that remains challenging. In the face of these pressures, consumers stayed resilient, and we continue to invest behind our loved brands to drive value in the marketplace and growth in our business. Given our strong results year-to-date, and increased visibility into the rest of the year, we are raising our top line and bottom line guidance, while continuing to invest strategically. So this morning, I'll provide a business update and discuss how we are expanding the circumference of what we can control. Then I'll pass to John, and he will discuss financial details for the quarter, our revised guidance for the full year 2022 and some early considerations for 2023. During the third quarter, macroeconomic crosscurrents continued to impact the operating environment. The conflict in Ukraine is ongoing, which creates challenges in that country and beyond. And we saw renewed pandemic-related mobility restrictions in China. Inflationary forces are driving costs, pricing and interest rates higher, resulting in currency volatility in many parts of the world. Against this backdrop, our industry remains healthy and is growing both in value and volume, which continues to include some benefit from cycling COVID-related impacts from the prior year. In the third quarter, we delivered strong organic revenue growth across all operating segments. This was driven by pricing actions and robust volume growth. We had share gains overall and across most categories, as well as within both at-home and away-from-home channels. We accomplished this by investing in our business and providing the right portfolio of brands and packages to retain and add consumers. Notably, we drove revenue growth ahead of transactions growth, which is also ahead of volume growth in the quarter, reflecting the strength of our revenue growth management capabilities. Consumer elasticities in core categories have continued to hold up well. We are leveraging our consumer-centric marketing model and increasingly using digital engagement to link consumption occasions with passion points. Our system has never been stronger, and our global network model is allowing us to leverage the vast experiences of the systems' leaders from various parts of the world. We are increasingly sharing learnings and generating faster responses to a changing environment through the right mix of local relevance and scale. Now recapping the third quarter performance across the world, starting with Asia Pacific. In India, we continued to strengthen in the first half of the year as we gained share in sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coke delivered strong growth through effective execution and occasion-based marketing. Year-to-date, we drove approximately 2.5 billion transactions at affordable price points through the expansion of returnable glass bottles and single-serve PET packages. Sprite has grown to become a $1 billion brand in the market, driven by the success of locally adapted occasion-based global marketing campaigns like Heat Happens and Screentime. In Japan, we continue to strengthen our business amidst an inflationary environment in the country for the first time in many years, we took price increases in large PET packages. Through intelligent innovation on small packs, we've gained value share, transactions and household penetration year-to-date. Additionally, we continued our strong share gains in vending in the quarter, and we expanded our leadership position in e-commerce. In China, we grew volume in the quarter and achieved strong growth in sparkling soft drinks during the summer selling season, amidst varying levels of pandemic-related mobility restrictions. We focused on digital to unlock new opportunities. We deployed Fans Festival, a drink-scan-win pilot at scale, which drove widespread brand exposure and connected consumer traffic to more than 30,000 outlets. We remain focused on executing RGM strategies to drive outlet expansion and increase key SKU availability. In ASEAN and South Pacific, we saw strong volume and transaction growth across most markets, driven by new product launches and continued recovery in away-from-home channels. We saw significant top line improvement in sparkling flavors for most markets, driven by our Sprite Lemon+ and Schweppes Soda Zero Sugar innovations. In EMEA, European consumers continue to experience inflationary costs. We leveraged our RGM strategies to drive away-from-home single-serve mix and retain consumers, and delivered value share gains across most categories. And our system has delivered top tier incremental retail value for customers year-to-date, the second year in a row. We accelerated digital engagement with more than 4 million connected consumers year-to-date. In Africa, despite the macro environment remaining challenging, we gained volume and value share. We focus relentlessly on excellence in execution and reduced retail out-of-stocks. We've built sustainable customer engagement in more than 80,000 points of sale year-to-date through a customer loyalty partnership program. In Eurasia and the Middle East, we remain resilient amidst an unprecedented inflationary environment in many markets and some supply-related disruptions. A cross-market launch of fee for activation and the Fanta Fest campaign were key enablers of growth. With strong focus on execution, we placed over 50,000 coolers and have gained availability in 33,000 new outlets year-to-date. In North America, we drove volume and value share gains through strong core sparkling performance, complemented by robust innovation and music-led experiential marketing despite intermittent supply chain challenges. Smartwater growth was strong during the quarter and innovations like Coca-Cola Creations and Minute Maid Aguas Frescas continue to expand and exceed expectations. The Coca-Cola Value Bundle, a collection of core sparkling offerings, providing more choices to cost-conscious consumers, is helping to retain and recruit more consumers while creating value for our customers. In Latin America, we leveraged connected experiences and strong execution to drive top line growth and sequentially improve on our share losses. We strengthened our connections with [Use Through Music], leveraging the Coca-Cola Marshmallow flavor to stream Rock in Rio across the continent. Through RGM initiatives, we focused on single-serve package growth to drive transaction growth. Alignment with our bonding partners remain strong, and our joint market initiatives are ensuring our focus on accelerating growth. In Global Ventures, we witnessed robust volume growth. However, overall cost of performance was impacted by a dynamic operating environment in the UK, along with investments in the marketplace as we expand internationally. China ready-to-drink value share grew with the strong performance of innovations like [Costa Char Tea] and [Oak Coffee]. Ready-to-drink in Japan is also delivering strong performance supported by sampling in-store execution and the launch of Caramel Latte. Finally, our Bottling Investments Group delivered strong volume and top line performance driven by a focus on affordable entry-pack expansion across all markets. Additionally, we're driving availability and efficiencies in cost to serve. As we look forward beyond this year, we continue to see great opportunity for our industry. We are allocating resources in a disciplined way to gain share. Success from our marketing model is based on two critical components: linking occasions and passion points to drive engagement, and leveraging experiments to optimize our marketing. This drives deeper connections with consumers, reaching them in new and unique ways. The launch of the Bleeding is Magic global campaign for the FIFA World Cup celebrates the passionate journey of soccer fans by unveiling a suite of digital experiences that capture the full extent of fans' devotion to their beloved teams. The campaign includes the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour as well as a digital hub called Coca-Cola Fan Zone, which creates in-person opportunities for fans to come together to trade Panini stickers behind the Coca-Cola labels. This campaign has already led to a gain of more than 3.5 million consumers for direct engagement. Building on our digital experiments, we also announced a strategic partnership in six countries with Grab, Southeast Asia's leading connected app. This builds new consumer connections and offers a new level of convenience Through a mix of off-line advertising on the Grab fleet, online advertising in the Grab app, gamification and product sampling, we are building more purchasing occasions to grow demand for at-home consumption. Our innovations have delivered strong results with more than 25% contribution to incremental gross profit year-to-date. Our innovations span markets and categories, with 55% of year-to-date innovations outside of the sparkling category. Our pipeline is robust and we are excited about their unique consumer propositions. For example, Coca-Cola Creations is providing bold on-trend flavors designed to build both with younger consumers. Ready-to-drink Costa offers new and exciting flavors with authentic, rich coffee and milk taste. We are also excited about the potential for Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink, which will launch in Mexico in the fourth quarter and is coming to a digital markets next year, including the U.S. in the spring through our agreements with Brown-Forman. This will give consumers a convenient way to enjoy the world's most popular bar cooler. Our innovations are designed with scalability in mind to further support our growth portfolio. We expect inflationary pressures to continue, so we are leveraging all the levers of RGM at our disposal, including price, promotional intelligence and proactive mix management. Our RGM capability is mining insights such as consumer motivations as well as category and customer opportunities, giving us a precise approach to package, placement and promotional investments. This drives trip conversion and value growth for customers. For example, in Japan, we are seeing strong results from our segmented approach. Instead of our key 500 ml PET pack for Fanta, we now sell one smaller 350 ml PET pack on the go and one larger 700 ml PET pack for home occasions. This dual pack strategy has increased beverage incidents by 9%. In Q3, retail value transactions and market share were all up for these packages. Our system is investing to grow our executional footprint, adding to what was already pervasive distribution resulting in availability of our products in nearly 2/3 of all outlets globally. These strong results are clear proof points of what is possible when our alliance system leans forward for growth. Underpinning all of this work is our purpose to Refresh the World and Make a Difference. Sustainability remains an integral part of our business and strategy and is a key driver of future growth and business resilience. While we have made progress towards our World Without Waste goals, we remain committed to do more and faster so we can grow our business the right way. We're continuing to partner with other businesses, civil society and governments to support cooperative action on this critical issue. During the quarter, we played a leadership role and helped launch the business coalition for a global plastics treaty convened by key partners, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and World Wildlife Fund, alongside other private sector companies. We are also continuing to take steps to help drive the circular economy by making our bottles more eco-friendly. In North America and Latin America, Sprite has shifted all of its PET packaging from green to clear, improving the efficiency of recycling systems and increasing the availability of food-grade rPET. In Vietnam, we launched Coca-Cola bottles made from 100% recycled plastic, excluding the cap and the label. We now have more than 30 markets where we offer at least one brand in a 100% rPET package, with similar launches planned in additional markets next year. In an operating environment that increasingly puts more variables into the equation than we've seen in the past, we are focused on delivering and executing for growth. We are encouraged by what we are seeing in the business. We are committed to expanding the circumference of what we can control by delivering world-class marketing, disciplined innovation, excellence in revenue growth management, and laser-sharp execution in the marketplace, with a goal of operating at a higher level through these challenging market conditions. We are doing this with capable and aligned bottling partners around the world. The combination of strong loved brands and a pervasive distribution system is a formula for resilience in times like these, and we are pleased to be raising both our top line and bottom line guidance today.  With that, I'll turn the call over to you, John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll comment on our third quarter performance and provide considerations for our updated guidance to this year. I'll also provide some early commentary on 2023 and what actions we are taking to drive a top line-led growth equation to navigate this dynamic environment. . We are encouraged with the continued momentum of our business, and we delivered another set of strong results in the third quarter. We grew organic revenue 16%, unit cases grew 4%, with broad-based growth across most operating segments and targeted investments in the marketplace. Concentrate sales were in line with unit cases for the quarter. Our price/mix of 12% was driven primarily by pricing actions across operating segments, along with revenue growth management initiatives, further improvement in away-from-home channels in most markets and positive segment mix. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 190 basis points versus the prior year. The underlying margin compression was approximately 60 basis points, with the rest of the impact coming from currency headwinds driven by the volatile macro backdrop and the mechanical effect of consolidating the BODYARMOR finished goods business. We significantly stepped up our consumer and customer-facing investments to support our robust marketing agenda and strong innovation pipeline. Notwithstanding higher costs and continued investments in the marketplace, we expanded underlying operating margin by approximately 100 basis points, driven by strong top line growth. Comparable operating margin, however, compressed by approximately 50 basis points due to the impact of the BODYARMOR acquisition and currency headwinds. Below the line, we benefited from a lower-than-expected effective tax rate for the full year. All in, third quarter comparable EPS of $0.69 grew 7% year-over-year, and this was impacted by 11 points of currency headwinds. On cash flow, we delivered free cash flow of $7.3 billion year-to-date driven by our strong business performance. This was 14% lower versus the prior year, primarily due to two items: one, cycling the timing of working capital benefits in the prior year; and two, higher 2021 annual incentives paid in the first quarter. Additionally, our net debt leverage is 1.8x EBITDA, which is slightly below our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x. As we look to the operating environment, there are clearly many variables at play today, as James mentioned. We are spinning our top line and bottom line flywheels faster to fortify our business and manage through many types of environments, and we're investing in the marketplace to create value for our customers and consumers. Given our strong results and the visibility we have for the rest of the year, we are raising guidance for the full year. We now expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 14% to 15% and comparable currency-neutral EPS growth of 15% to 16%. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we expect currency to be a 7-point headwind to comparable net revenues and a 9-point headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022. We now expect an underlying effective tax rate of 19% in 2022. All in, we expect comparable earnings per share growth of 6% to 7% versus 2021. We continue to expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow for 2022, through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less about $1.5 billion in capital investments. There are some considerations to keep in mind for Q4 that we factored into our full year guidance. There is an additional day in the fourth quarter, however, we expect concentrate sales to end the year in line with unit case sales. We are investing in consumer-facing marketing to get a fast start for next year. Lastly, given the backdrop of rising interest rates, we expect to see an impact on our interest expense given our effective exposure to floating rate debt. The environment remains volatile, and while we are preparing for many futures in 2023, we did want to share some early considerations for next year based on what we know today. We are encouraged by the momentum in our top line and we leverage our capabilities to sustain top line growth with the ongoing inflationary backdrop. As we look to our cost outlook, we expect global inflation to continue to impact our expenses across the board and commodities to remain volatile. We benefited from hedges in our commodity exposure this year. And even though some of the commodities have started to come off their highs, we expect another year of elevated inflation on a per case basis next year. We estimate the underlying effective tax rate to be 19.5% for 2023. Regarding currency, if we were to assume current rates and our hedge positions, there would be an approximate 5-point to 6-point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 7-point to 8-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023. However, given the amount of volatility in the currency markets, this initial view could change when we come back to you for the fourth quarter call in February. We are committed to delivering top line-led growth and we remain focused and confident in our ability to achieve our three key objectives: investing for the long-term health of the business, winning locally and generating U.S. dollar EPS growth. We are pleased with our results so far and have the visibility to deliver on our updated guidance, creating value for our shareowners through strong top line growth, cash flow generation and dividend growth. Our strong system leadership and the tremendous ongoing commitment of our people around the world gives us confidence that we will continue to deliver sustainable results in the year ahead. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. \nBryan Spillane: So I guess, John, I wanted to just pick up on your commentary about '23. We've got this question a bunch this morning about dollar earnings growth next year. So I just want to clarify, in your comments on those three objectives, does that apply to next year kind of based on where you sit now? And then maybe if you can just talk about some of the trade-offs with regards to delivering on dollar earnings growth given all of the dynamics that are going on in the marketplace.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Bryan. Yes, those comments were very much related to next year. We do see a path to generating U.S. dollar EPS growth next year. Clearly, there's a lot of variables in the equation. And if anything, there's even more variability with some of those variables. We've talked a lot about our strategy is to lead a sustainable equation from the top line. We continue to have confidence in the momentum that our business has and to continue that momentum. The cost outlook does remain more elevated than we are used to. But we've got a higher revenue, higher cost algorithm that we're looking to manage going into next year. I think the work we've done over the last couple of years to build flexibility to be able to adapt quicker than perhaps we have done historically to changes in the markets around us, is something that we take on board and will continue to drive. And with that, we've given the guidance or the considerations for next year. And we're very focused on finishing the year strong, starting fast and being able to deliver on those three objectives.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian : So obviously, another set of strong top line results in the quarter. You also mentioned the underlying top line momentum in the release when thinking about 2023. So just wanted to get a bit of an update, given the external environment, there's obviously a lot of concerns around weaker consumer spending and some of the pressure points out there. Do you guys see anything towards the end of the quarter or so far in October that would give you any cause for concern? And as you think about these much higher than typical levels of pricing, are you seeing any sort of changes in consumer volume demand elasticity, that pricing, as you look around the world here, that would be helpful?\nJames Quincey : Yes. Thanks, Dara. The short answer is yes. We're seeing some changes in consumer behavior. I mean, overall, in the third quarter, consumer remained pretty resilient and elasticities were at the better end of the spectrum. Clearly, there are some changes in consumer behavior going on. We talked last quarter about how we have typically experienced recessions.  In other words, there tends to be a sequence, which is that the consumers back off on some more discretionary, higher ticket items white goods types of things. And then as they -- as the pressure comes on purchasing power, they start to reevaluate the total basket. They tend to squeeze down the basket size per trip and they look in some categories where the equity isn't as strong to perhaps trade down to some private label or smaller packages. And you can clearly see that happening -- beginning to happen in a number of places. It would seem to us that Europe is probably the most obvious example, where, in the at-home channel, you can see some growth in private label across a number of categories. In beverages, you could see it tick up a little in water and juices. You can certainly see the growth of the hard discounters, some channel shifting in Europe. That's very consistent with purchasing power squeeze behavior, some signs of that, too, in the U.S. with the dollar channels. So there's clearly the impact of inflation running ahead of wages is starting to come through now that the summer is over and back to school has happened. Our focus and our confidence in our year-to-go and going into next year is about the momentum we've created in our business over the years and our ability to not just to continue with marketing and innovation, but to leverage all the thinking behind revenue growth management and the price pack promo architectures to maximize affordability, and therefore, accessibility of our categories for those consumers that are under pressure. And, of course, backed by excellence in execution and generating the value for retailers by our system that will help us get through what is likely, in all likelihood, going to be a tighter situation for the next six to 12 months. And if I just come back and close the circle by using the European example, where consumers are under pressure. In the third quarter, the Coke system was the biggest creator of additional retail value for at-home retailers well ahead of the rest of CPG. But we believe we have a strategy that's given us momentum. It will see us through the year to go. It will see us into 2023. It may, as John said, end up with above algorithm pricing and some pressure on volume, but we believe our top line can go forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. \nLauren Lieberman : You'd mentioned the ability for the company to adapt more quickly than in the past. And I was intrigued by the example you gave of the value packs in North America that you've started to roll out. So I was curious if you could tell us a bit more about kind of how broad-based those are, the degree to which that's something that's being explored for other markets? And James, you just mentioned some of the pressures in Western Europe, but anything you can share on the kind of leveraging experience and learning across the global system in terms of how to manage through in different RGM type practices?\nJames Quincey : Yes, absolutely. I mean value packs or ensuring affordability for the consumer is one of the core pieces of RGM. It's about extending the price ladder and, in recessionary times, about making sure the entry price point, whether it would be on the larger packs or on the smaller packs becomes as low down in the price spectrum, the actual out-of-pocket as possible. As I talked about in the last answer, one of the recession behavior tends to be to try and reduce the dollar outlay of the basket, and therefore, the price point becomes even more important than the price per liter.  And so around the world, that's absolutely what we're pursuing, whether it's in the U.S., having smaller bottles or smaller multipacks of less cans per multipack; or the example I used, in Japan, where we took the 500 ml and split it into 350 and 700. Of course, around the world in a number of countries, we leverage our capabilities with returnable bottles, given the economics of returnables particularly in the developing markets, that is a way of generating a lower price point because, of course, in effect, you don't pay for the packaging because it comes back again. And so those returnable bottles that we refill are a way of bringing the price points down and keeping the consumer in the category. And so that's -- it's a well-developed skill around the world. The bottlers share a lot of learnings between themselves on how to think about the technology of RGM, and that allows us to leverage it to its maximum, particularly in times like these.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: I guess just to drill a little bit further into the path to dollar-based EPS growth next year. Clearly, as we stand here today, there are a number of headwinds to overcome, and you've outlined and quantified some of them between FX and interest expense, underlying inflation, higher year-over-year tax rate next year. I guess what I'm left trying to unravel is how dependent is the path to dollar-based EPS growth next year on this continued top line momentum that you've been -- that you've emphasized today versus are there other levers that you can look to, whether that's paring back a bit on marketing investments and the innovation agenda investments or just doubling down on productivity? I guess the question I'm asking is, underneath from an underlying perspective, is it -- are we to be -- are we -- how dependent are we on that top of momentum continuing versus there being other levers that the company can look to?\nJames Quincey: The simple answer, Steve, is we're very dependent on top line momentum. In the sense that we are going to continue, we believe, barring something very unforeseen or at this stage, we believe we're going to continue to invest for the long-term health of the business and that's going to drive top line growth, as it has. I mean, if I -- just for the sake of the argument, if you take the five-year CAGR of revenue through all the ups and downs of COVID and everything, in round numbers, it's trending at 6% compound for the last five years. So preserving and sustaining top line momentum is actually the key starting point. And of course, if there are parts of the world where circumstances do not merit continued high levels of marketing investment and there's reasons to pare back, then as John mentioned earlier, we absolutely will lean on our increased degree of agility and adaptability to make those adjustments in the moment. And similarly, with any SG&A. But the predominant drivers, again, is going to be the top line. We will manage the other elements of the P&L based on the local markets. I don't think it's our expectation that this is going to be like the second quarter of 2020, where everything stoped everywhere at the same time. If there are to be pressures, it's likely that they are spread out over time. So the predominant modus operandi will be leaning to growth, invest in top line growth. And then yes, we expect, at times, different markets to kind of have to, yes, optimize the marketing. But on an overall basis, it's top line momentum driven.\nOperator: Next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. \nNik Modi: So James, I was wondering if you could just comment. I saw some of the organizational priorities that came out of the U.S. bottler meeting recently, and I was hoping, just linked to this top line momentum comment, if you can provide some context on other markets in terms of organizational priorities, whether it be some of your larger markets like in Japan or in Western Europe or Latin America. Maybe you can just share some thoughts on how you're thinking about some of the key initiatives in those regions.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean let's start with Japan. Clearly, in Japan, we're very focused on the marketing and innovation. It tends to be a market that's very driven by engagement with the consumer. Also, importantly in Japan, after perhaps multiple decades of not taking price, we have taken price on large packs in Japan in the third quarter. Actually, in the fourth quarter, we've been taking pricing on immediate consumption packaging in Japan. So I think we're going to see an opportunity to lean a little more on the RGM lever in Japan as we continue to engage with the consumer there. In Western Europe, clearly, the basic strategy of investing in marketing, investing in innovation, leveraging RGM and driving in-store execution and value for retailers has been working in Western Europe. As we go into the winter and going into next year, that's still going to be the push we make. The bottlers have got great momentum in execution. Of course, Europe is where there's more of the developed world inflation. Think commodities plus the devaluation of the euro, so that's feeding through. And so we're likely to have to lean heavier on RGM in Europe in the next 12 months, backed up by the marketing, innovation and execution. And then Latin America, a lot of work over the last number of years with the long-term relationship model. Bottlers there have good momentum. Clearly, it's one of our strongest regions. We lost a little share in the beginning of the year. They're very focused on getting that back, obviously, starting from a high bar. And I think perhaps, overall, it would be worth commenting that, obviously, in COVID, we took a number of what were difficult decisions at the time, slimming down the portfolio, changing the marketing model, changing the organizational model for the company. We've got that done and stood up. And I think now we're reaping the benefits of us being able to drive growth with a more agile organization ourselves, combined with really strong and aligned bottling partners. We've driven growth this year, and we're well set up next year. I mean just to cap it all, we had a global system top to top with a number of the bottlers a few weeks ago, and I think everyone is ready and energized for what's ahead.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala : Can you talk a bit about fixed versus floating debt and how that might impact both your cash balance and your interest expense in the coming year?\nJohn Murphy : Sure, Kaumil, thanks for the question. Yes, as you know, we manage our funding through -- with an eye towards liquidity risk and with a multiyear lens, and have done that for many years. We've -- through COVID, I think we've talked about we've pushed our age of our debt out a number of years. And we do have a mix of fixed and floating. Most of the floating is in euro, and so we will wait and see what ECB does over the coming months to have a clearer picture on the impact for 2023. But I think it's an area that we'll provide more detail on in February, subject to the development by the Fed here and by ECB over the coming months.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. \nBonnie Herzog : I have a question on your commodity inflation. John, you touched on this, but hoping you could help frame the commodity inflation expectation next year. You mentioned another year of expected growth, but is it realistic to expect this growth might be more modest versus this year, possibly in the mid-single-digit range, given some of your commodities peaking as well as hedges you have in place? And then I guess I'm asking in the context of the pricing environment and whether you think it's likely that ongoing price increases maybe won't need to be as aggressive and we might actually see a step-up in promotional spend to ensure price points for consumers are affordable. And then if so, is it realistic to expect a better balance between price/mix and volume growth next year?\nJohn Murphy : A lot of questions, Bonnie. Let me start with the commodity point and our outlook for the year ahead. As I said at the -- I think in answer to the first question, there are a lot of variables in that equation. And indeed, the variability with some of them is maybe even broader. When I think about the cost environment, not just the commodity environment, I think about both our commodities, the commodity pressures that we have within our business and the non-commodity pressures that we have. And so as we look at '23 on the commodity front, we are rolling off some very favorable hedges that we were fortunate to have this year. And it's still -- in our mind, it's still unclear as to how commodities will trend over the next six to 12 months. So we'll have more visibility on that when we get to the call in February. With regard to the non-commodity items, just within that, you've got a bucket of different topics -- freight, logistics, the transportation in our finished goods models and the overall wage environment. And we have to take into account that the wage environment is not the same everywhere, and indirect impacts on supply chain pressures. As we think about the supply chain, it's important to not just have efficiency as a metric, we also need to make sure that we have continuity, we have, for the short and longer term, and we're able to manage many of the pressures that I think we've talked about on previous calls, manage those effectively. So there's a lot going on inside of the cost of goods line. And hence, I think it's better for us to just provide you with how we're seeing it overall, and we'll come back in February with more specifics. And to your second question on ongoing price increases, I think it links back to some of James' comments earlier. The name of the game is to optimize our revenue equation over the next 12 to 18 months. That's going to be a combination of smart pricing, understanding the mix, both from a channel and package perspective, and being able to utilize the many levers that we have inside of the RGM toolkits that our bottlers have. So again, I think at this stage, it's still early to say what the exact numbers will be for each of those topics. But I think the broader point is that the top line momentum that we've enjoyed here today, that we see continuing to hold through the rest of the year, is something that we expect to be able to generate into 2023.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. \nChristopher Carey: So just following up on that. I think it's pretty well established price/mix versus volume algorithm will probably be more skewed to price/mix next year again. This could be for James or John, but is it fair to assume that the rate of pricing is likely to be a bigger percentage of the price/mix equation going forward as we lap the recovery and the away-from-home channel and some other channel mix dynamics? And then just connected, James, it's been harder to see the underlying rate of pricing this year relative to the price mix. Can you just remind us your philosophy for the rate of pricing to track inflation, and whether you believe your business is close to satisfying that objective today and perhaps how much room you have?\nJames Quincey : Yes, Chris, I think, yes, clearly, it's likely that next year price/mix will run ahead of volume in a similar way it has this year. I mean our long-term growth algorithm has assumed a relative balance between price and mix. Clearly, at the moment, we're in a period where there's more price/mix than there is volume, and that seems that seems likely to continue into next year. It is also true that, this year, there has been some benefit from the channel mix on the reopening. The reopening benefit that was obviously a reopening cost in the previous year in price/mix is now largely done. And so that kind of tailwind won't be there last -- next year. Are all the channels away from home completely reopened? No. But the remaining kind of sliver is either a function of closed outlets or something that's going to take a while to come back. And of course, some of the mobility restrictions in places like China, which I think also won't snap back certainly in the first half of next year. So the away-from-home of price/mix won't be the tailwind next year. And so in that sense, yes, we'll be very much back to it's all about what's the rate and what's the benefit from all the RGM strategies, whether to drive affordability or to offer premium categories or package sizes, and that's what will be the primary driver going into next year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan Chase.\nAndrea Teixeira : So I wanted to go back to John's comment on growing EPS in dollar terms next year. And along with that, James, you mentioned that you're looking at pricing above algorithm, which makes sense. But given the volume loss, I was just hoping if you can comment, in general, as we stand right now, that operating income would probably grow faster than EPS in order to absorb some of the unfavorable hedges and any issues in the financial expenses. Is that the way we should be thinking of next year, to a more muted EPS growth? Or you still think you can grow above low single next year in EPS?\nJohn Murphy : So, Andrea, thanks. I'll take that. As we said on the earlier, I think it's too early to get into those specifics for next year. I think the way to think about the year ahead is I think it's going to be another year out of our typical algorithm. We continue to build greater visibility around how -- what to expect in the -- particularly in the first half of the year when we'll be looking for that fast start. What each line item of the income statement looks like is -- it's just too early. We'll come back in February with that detail. I think the key takeaway is that as we sit here, we do see a path to generating U.S. dollar EPS growth in 2023. As I said earlier, there's many variables to bring that path to fruition. And we know that top-line driven smart investments and effective management of our cost structure, those thee will deliver. And below the operating income line, as I said, there's a lot that still needs to play out in the next few months to give you a clearer picture on what to expect. And we'll come back in February with that detail.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlos Laboy from HSBC.\nCarlos Laboy : Yes. Some of the benefits of the new Latin American LCRM are obvious, like faster revenue growth, higher ROIC for the bottlers for the system, really clarity of profit splits. But can you expand on some of the less obvious but important benefits that are important to you, James?\nJames Quincey : Sure. Thanks, Carlos. I mean, clearly, this is a feature of particularly the Latin American system. We're using similar models in conversations around the world. They're built on many years of working together collaboratively in Latin America. And then other than some of the features that you mentioned, I think what's really kind of less visible perhaps is its ability to speed up the rate at which actions or decisions and actions are taken by the system. And so it has provided a stimulus to really focusing in on getting to grips with some of the nausea problems and to moving with speed and simplifying the decision-making progress in a whole series of areas, particularly those that have been kind of slower historically.  Some of the stills business models come to mind, particularly as it relates to Latin America. And that will ultimately feed through to, as I said, speed of decision-making, which then needs better marketplace actions, whether that be marketing, innovation, RGM or execution. And I think the system in Latin America is very energized and building on their historic great position and set for further momentum going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore ISI.\nRobert Ottenstein: And terrific results. I was wondering, James, if you could drill down a little bit more on what's going on in emerging markets and the emerging market consumer. We were a little surprised by the results of China looking to be maybe a little bit more, do a little better than we had modeled given the lockdowns. Some of the other emerging markets, a little bit weaker than we would have thought. So I guess the question is, are -- is local competition a problem? Is it demand? Is it too much pricing? And obviously, it depends market by market. But if you could give us some sense of what is going on in the major emerging markets, that would be helpful.\nJames Quincey : Sure. I'm not sure which ones you're putting in the bucket of weaker, but let me do a little walk around some of the emerging markets. We had good results we feel in China for the quarter. I mean we had good growth overall for China, notwithstanding some of the mobility restrictions that came in the whole raft of cities. So China remains a good long-term opportunity. We have a good business there, good bottling partners, and there was some resilience to the business in the quarter. . Just keeping with the Asian theme, India had a knockout quarter. Clearly, they're having a very strong run this year. Lots of growth in India, really powering forward. Very pleased with that. Looking, of course, to extend that into the future. Probably won't be a straight line, but certainly looking to continue to invest strongly in India. The rest of ASEAN, there were some pluses and minuses, but generally positive. If I switch to Africa. Africa, you've heard me talk in the past that it's always a rollercoaster. There was a little bit of rollercoaster in the quarter. But overall, we had good growth in those markets we were focused on. There was growth that was ultimately pretty broad-based, whether that was South Africa or elsewhere. It would be worth noting that this quarter, remember, we made a switch in our franchise partner in a number of territories across Africa. So we brought to a close our relationship with BGI, the Castel Group, in a whole raft of African markets. And some of them we had partners ready to go, and some of them we're still working on it. So there is a transition loss of volume in those ex-BGI territories where we ceased that partnership. And so that weighs on the Africa number. And then as you keep going around the world, obviously, Latin America had a good quarter. And then I think the last one I'm really missing is a bit of Eurasia. And there, we had a pretty decent quarter. We had growth in Turkey, which is an important market to us, and a number of other of the Central Asian markets and the Middle Eastern markets. Obviously, those ones that are -- tend to have resources or oil exporting countries tend to have done better than the heavily oil-importing countries, so the Middle East is better than Egypt. Of course, remember that the EMEA numbers have the dropout of the Russia business.\nOperator: Next question comes from Charlie Higgs from Redburn.\nCharlie Higgs: So we're a year now into the reformulation of Coco-Cola Zero Sugar. And to cap it off, we've seen 11% volume growth and double-digit growth in developed markets. So James, just wondering your opinion on Coke Zero, how it's gone since the relaunch? And then also just looking into 2023, does your approach to innovation change at all that we think we're going to enter a weakening consumer environment?\nJames Quincey : Yes, sure. Look, super happy with Coke Zero Sugar. We have been investing behind it for a good number of years and have been driving double-digit Coke Zero Sugar volumes for many years in a row. And obviously, that's getting really material, including strong double-digit growth in the U.S. So very pleased with the reformulation update. Of course, we continue to bring new marketing and new innovation to Coke Zero Sugar and it's going to be a big focus of what we drive going forward. On innovation, as it relates to 2023. I mean, yes, there will be a kind of bias shift in the mix of the innovation for 2023. If one of the imperatives remains affordability and to kind of anchor price points, at the low end of the actual dollar outlay, then clearly, package innovation takes a bigger role in that sort of environment, whether it be smaller packages, whether it be the returnable packaging. Big investments going in by the bottling system in returnable packaging to help the affordability strategy. So in a kind of purchasing power pressured year for the consumer, we expect innovation to be slightly heavier on the packaging side, particularly to drive affordability. But of course, that will also have its other side of the coin which is to try and ensure there are some perhaps more premium options for those that still have plenty of disposable income. Not everyone will have exactly the same effect in this period. So likely to see continued push, for example, in the U.S. on small cans or sleek cans to really stretching out the pricing ladder, not just putting all the bets on the affordable end. And we will continue with the brand and the product innovation. I don't know if you went to the NACS. There was a lot of innovation on show the Convenience Store Conference for the North America, there was a lot of innovation on display there, both package and product. And so we will be approaching '23 with a broad innovation agenda, but with some slight weighting to packaging to stretch on the price ladder.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS.\nPeter Grom: So I guess I wanted to circle back to '23 guidance. And I guess what I'm trying to understand is the company's long-term algorithm has largely embedded some operating leverage over time. And maybe I'm just reading too much into this, but there was just a lot of emphasis throughout the call today that next year will be a top line-driven year. And so I guess based on where things stand today, should we expect underlying growth from a top line and operating profit perspective to be more aligned versus what's embedded in a long-term algorithm? Again, I could be misinterpreting the emphasis, but if that's correct, it would imply very strong top line growth in order to deliver U.S. dollar EPS growth.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks for the question. And just to maybe to reiterate, the difference, I think, between the long-term growth algorithm and what may be coming at us over the next year or so, I think it's going to be somewhat out of algorithm, given the various factors that we have discussed on the call and indeed have discussed throughout the year. So at this point in time, I think it is too soon to give you line-by-line guidance. But we continue to see a path to generate U.S. dollar EPS growth in 2023, and that will be -- will need to be driven from the top line. The cost pressures are there. We're very aware of them. We talked about the currency outlook. And so, we still think when you put all the pieces together that we have that path. But we'll have a lot more coming at us over the next three to four months. And in February, can give you a more granular breakdown of how we expect to get there.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities.\nBill Chappell : Just I guess a question on some of the competitive response or individual markets. I mean everything you've talked about today has certainly been positive. And I guess, any of the the setbacks have been kind of attributed to macro issues. Are there any areas where you're worried about where there's been a competitive response, where you need to step up, be it on a product or an individual country? Or is it really just there's just so much momentum and anything else is just macro related?\nJames Quincey : It would be a particularly delusional position to, say, I'm not worried about anything. That would be very weird. But clearly, we have -- it's a competitive industry. There are a lot of good competitors, big and small. So we absolutely worry what they're up to. We always take it from satisfying the consumer and the retailer point of view. We're not chasing the competitors, we're chasing the consumers and the retailers. And certainly, there, we could point to a set of things where competitors have done well, and that calls attention to us to whether we are really doing everything we can to satisfy the consumer or the retailer. I think one obvious example is in sports drinks advanced hydration in the U.S., where this year, our competitors are coming off having a whole series of supply chain challenges last year. And that's -- we had a great year last year, and we've had a not-so-great year this year and we're also obviously in the transition of taking on the BODYARMOR. But the U.S. bottlers are very energized about the BODYARMOR and Powerade plans going forward. A lot of innovation on the brand, on the product, on the packaging setup. So we'll be back. I mean -- but it's -- what guides us is are we satisfying the consumer and the retailer.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.\nJames Quincey: Thank you, operator. So just in summary, third quarter results, I think, exemplify how we're executing and winning in the marketplace. It's been driven by the work we've done as a system and the transformation we've undergone over the last few years. We are a more resilient business, and we're committed to delivering long-term value for our shareholders and stakeholders. And thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "KO", "quarter": 2, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-07-26 12:16:07", "content": "Operator: At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Coca-Cola Company's Second Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call.

[Operator Instructions] Now I'll turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we delivered strong performance by continuing to execute on our growth strategy. Our industry remained robust, and we gained both volume and value share in the quarter. Our first half 2022 results and the resiliency of our business give us confidence to raise our top line guidance. This is offsetting the meaningful increases in costs and currency headwinds to hold our bottom line U.S. dollar outlook of 5% to 6% growth, even as we accelerate investments in our business to drive future growth. These results are enabled by our organization's purpose-led culture, strong alignment with our bottling partners and the dedication and flexibility of our people while driving our growth agenda. This morning, I'll discuss the current operating environment and how we're delivering results and building for the future in that environment and the progress on our sustainability agenda. Then John will discuss the financial details of the quarter and how we are building resilience to manage through external factors worldwide. During the second quarter, the operating environment continued to be asynchronous with many moving parts. Some regions continued to experience broad-based macro strength while others are experiencing strong inflationary pressures. Some countries are still recovering from the pandemic, while China experienced pandemic-related lockdowns. And the conflict in Ukraine is ongoing, and we'd like to send our thoughts and deepest sympathies to all of those who continue to be affected. With this as a backdrop, we have managed well with our bottlers and delivered robust revenue growth across all our geographic segments that encompass strong pricing actions and strong volume performance helped by away-from-home recovery. Consumer elasticities have largely held a better-than-expected year-to-date, though we are watching closely for signs of changing consumer behavior as the year goes on and as the average cost of the consumer basket continues to go up. We expect the consumer environment to be more challenging, and we are preparing accordingly, stepping up our investments, sharpening our resource allocation capabilities and tapping into data to better reach our consumers. We also recognize that the dollar strength is impacting our translated earnings, and we remain committed to delivering U.S. dollar growth. As a system, we are focusing on expanding the circumference of what we can control, understanding and providing what consumers want, ultimately giving them more reasons to choose our great brands and driving value for our consumers, our customers and the industry. Now recapping our Q2 performance across the world, starting with Asia Pacific. In India, we delivered our best-ever quarter volumetrically and added 1 billion incremental transactions in the quarter, led by affordable single-serve packs. We gained share in sparkling soft drinks and juices, and our system is continuing to invest in the marketplace availability and execution to capture growth. Japan made progress in recovery, and we gained share and consumers year-to-date versus 2019. Additionally, we gained 7 points of share of visible inventory, driven by coffee and Tea in the ambience base. We continue to have a strong innovation pipeline with the launch of Ayataka Hojicha Latte, non-alcohol Lemon-Dou, [indiscernible] and Georgia Latte Nista. Performance in China was under pressure, driven by COVID lockdowns. Volume was down for all months in the quarter, but the team persevered through a challenging environment, and recovery began in June as most restrictions started to lift. We focused on the core, prioritized top SKUs and reallocated resources to digital engagement, e-commerce and O2O as consumer demand shifted to at-home consumption. In ASEAN and South Pacific, macro fundamentals remained strong despite ongoing supply chain headwinds. We added new consumers, and transactions grew ahead of volume. We invested in consumer-facing marketing and improvement in execution and increased distribution across key entry packs and multipacks. Turning to EMEA. Europe saw strong volume performance, leading to value share gains across total NARTD and online. Strong marketing campaigns, including Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Zero Words, What The Fanta 3.0 and Sprite Screen Time Messaging are tying our beverages to more consumption occasions with better results. In Africa, we delivered strong performance and translated into NARTD volume and value share gains. We continue to focus on skills, affordability and in-market execution. Digital initiatives remained strong and grows merchandise value of our eB2B marketplace businesses were up approximately 50% sequentially. We accelerated cooler placement, reduced retail out of stocks and continued building RGM capability across markets. In Eurasia and Middle East, amidst an unprecedented inflationary environment, the industry is growing, and the recovery of the on-premise channel is driving our growth. Through the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour, we leveraged the iconic Coca-Cola trademark to generate significant media traction across the markets. Turning to North America. We gained both volume and value share through the strength of our brands despite navigating a challenging supply chain, including higher labor and freight costs. We continue to drive mix improvement in sparkling soft drinks and more than doubled mini can availability on this play. New product innovations, including Coke Starlight, Fanta Dragon Fruit Zero Sugar and Minute Maid Aguas Frescas are showing promising early results. We're continuing to work closely with our bottling partners to accelerate overall commercial execution. Turning to Latin America. We leverage compelling occasion-based marketing campaigns and execution in the marketplace, and our share losses improved sequentially. Coca-Cola trademark focus on building meals and brakes rituals under the Real Magic platform with returnable packages as the main enabler, while in juice and dairy, we're focused on everyday mills occasions. Our flavored alcohol beverage business is growing strongly. We're gaining share in the direct-to-consumer business and now reaching approximately 6.3 million consumers via digital channels. In Global Ventures, the cost of retail business was under pressure as footfall in the U.K. stayed below 2019 levels. However, the Costa Express platform remained robust, and the launch of the new Frappe range in the U.K. drove growth. Finally, our Bottling Investments Group delivered strong top line performance, driven by a focus on recruitment through affordable entry packs, including a relaunch of returnable glass bottles in India. Additionally, we saw continued sparkling soft drink share gains versus 2019 in the Philippines and Vietnam. While the macro environment is still asynchronous around the world, we're operating in an industry with a relatively predictable pattern of growth and attractive growth potential over the long term. So we're investing in our business and are anticipating the many futures as they come at us. We have managed a broad-based recovery coming out of the pandemic. Our 5-year average organic revenue growth rate is at the top end of our long-term growth target of 4% to 6%, which is a proof point of our transformed and strengthened organization. As we look to the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on raising the bar on the elements of our flywheels for top line growth and, as I said earlier, expand the circumference of what we can control, namely through building our strong portfolio of loved brands, excellence in revenue growth management and the power of our system execution. We're making targeted investments to unlock our growth agenda. We've built capabilities in brand building, innovation, RGM and execution, leveraging the power of scale while still being locally relevant to consumers. These investments enable us to win not only in today's environment but continue to build our business for the long term. Our new marketing model is focused on adding and retaining consumers. And we're doing this through an ecosystem of experiences that link consumption occasions with consumer passion points. The launch of the Global Magic Weekends campaign with Trademark Coke, in partnership with more than 20 food service aggregators, is showing great results. This campaign engages consumers at key moments from gaming to music to meal times. We are seeing 3.5x redemption levels for Coca-Cola combo meals versus pre-campaign levels and a 50% lift in outlets with Coca-Cola Zero Sugar availability. We also launched end-to-end digital-first brand campaigns for smartwater and vitaminwater, the snackable video content on social platforms for smartwater with global icon Zendaya and the launch of vitaminwater Lil Nas X partnership on TikTok is a different engagement approach to marketing that is already delivering strong results across channels. With new faces and new platforms for some of our billion-dollar brands, we are creating excitement and recruiting a new generation of drinkers. We continue to strengthen our RGM capabilities, which allows us to drive value for our consumers and our customers. RGM allows us to better navigate a dynamic consumer and retail environment, using effective tools such as price and promotional intelligence to leverage the power of our brands, proactive mix management and premiumization and addressing affordability to drive recruitment and keep value-conscious consumers. We work to bring these elements to life at a local level with our bottling partners. For example, in India, we focus on segmented pricing, increasing prices on multiserves and premium packs while holding transaction-driving price points in single-serve and the affordable portfolio. Additionally, we reached our highest-ever outlet availability and drove a 4-point increase in single-serve availability and a 6-point increase in affordable pack availability. In Europe, our system implemented several affordability and premiumization initiatives. We drove strong transaction and volume growth through initiatives like incentivizing multipacks to drive value on a price-per-ounce basis for consumers and driving single-serve packages like cans and returnable glass bottles in HORECA channels. By keeping transaction-driving price points in play, we expanded our consumer base with sparkling soft drinks in the region year-to-date. We're building consumer-centric loved brands and products, and our improving excellence in execution extends the building a more sustainable future for our business and the planet. During the quarter, we released our fourth World Without Waste Report, which provides an update on our ambitious sustainable packaging initiatives. It showcases how we are using our global reach and expertise to drive solutions at scale. Our operating units are further integrating sustainable practices into the business to drive growth. For example, in the United States, we are executing a set of initiatives to help solve the plastic waste problem. We recently joined industry groups, including the Consumer Goods Forum and the American Beverage Association, to support our model Extended Producer Responsibility Bill in Colorado. This is in addition to the support we provided for well-designed minimum-recycled content legislation in 3 states. These are now being enacted into law. Currently, 20-ounce bottles for Coca-Cola Trademark and The Summit in California, Texas, New York and throughout the Northeast are in 100% recycled PET. In 2021, we launched a bottled label clearly communicating that the bottles, excluding the caps and labels, are made from 100% recycled content, which is driving strong performance in the marketplace. Later this month, we will expand our use of 100% recycled PET throughout the U.S. and Canada. Every part of our business understands how their actions impact the company's wider sustainability goals, and we continue to make progress. To sum up, we are continuing to navigate a confluence of macroeconomic factors, and our networked organization is embracing the resilience to weather many environments. Guided by our purpose and with the right strategy through our portfolio and the right execution capabilities, we are confident about delivering top line growth for now and the long term. Before I turn the call over to John, I want to congratulate him for assuming the role of President beginning October 1, in addition to his current responsibility as a CFO. And of course, I also want to thank Brian Smith for his service and innumerable contributions to the system during his 25-year tenure with the company and wish him all the best for the future. So John, over to you.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I will briefly touch on the drivers of our second quarter performance and the update to our full year 2022 guidance, then I'll provide commentary on building resilience in our business by investing behind our brands and driving top line led growth. We're pleased with the continued momentum of our business around the world. This has translated into strong top line and comparable EPS growth, notwithstanding the larger-than-expected currency headwinds and increased cost pressures. We delivered organic revenue growth of 16%. Unit cases grew 8% with broad-based growth across all operating segments. Concentrate sales were behind unit cases by 4 points in the quarter, primarily due to the timing of shipments in Latin America and our Europe, Middle East and Africa Group. Our price/mix of 12% was primarily driven by strategic pricing actions across markets, along with revenue growth management initiatives, further improvement in away-from-home channels in most markets and positive segment mix. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 250 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to the impact of 3 items: one, an upsized increase in costs in the business due to the inflationary environment; two, currency headwinds driven by the volatile macro backdrop; and three, the mechanical effect of consolidating the BODYARMOR finished goods business. On the marketing front, we increased our consumer and customer-facing spending to create more value for our brands and continue to earn their respective price points. Despite increased investments and costs throughout the P&L, we expanded underlying operating margin by approximately 40 basis points, driven by a higher return from our investments in the marketplace. Comparable operating margin, however, compressed by approximately 110 basis points due to the BODYARMOR acquisition and currency headwinds. Putting this all together, second quarter comparable EPS of $0.70 grew 4% year-over-year. And this was impacted by 9 points of currency headwinds, 5 points higher than what we'd anticipated when we last gave guidance. On cash flow, we delivered free cash flow of $4.1 billion year-to-date, driven by our strong business performance. This was 20% lower versus the prior year, primarily due to 2 items: one, cycling the timing of working capital benefits in the prior year; and two, higher 2021 annual incentives paid in the first quarter. Additionally, our net debt leverage is 2.1x EBITDA, which is within the targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. As we look at the operating environment and the resilience consumers have shown thus far, we are watching closely for signs that indicate this may change. We remain ready to adapt. We're using a dynamic resource allocation framework to ensure our investments are directed towards country category combinations that drive the highest growth, thereby maximizing our returns. And we are working closely with our bottling partners to effectively navigate whatever comes our way. With this backdrop, this morning, we are raising our top line and currency-neutral EPS guidance. We now expect organic revenue growth of 12% to 13% and comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 14% to 15% versus 2021. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we now expect currency to be a 6-point headwind to comparable net revenues and a 9-point headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of 19.5% in 2022. And all in, we continue to expect comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus 2021. And we continue to expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow for 2022 through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments. There are some considerations to keep in mind for 2022 that we factored into our guidance. While our shipments are currently behind unit cases, we expect these to run in line for the full year with the catch-up expected in the fourth quarter. We now expect that the direct impact of the Ukraine conflict and the resulting suspensions of business in Russia, will be approximately $0.03 to comparable EPS. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we now expect commodity price inflation to move to a high single-digit impact from mid-single digits on comparable cost-of-goods sold in 2022. This is primarily due to commodity cost increases across our concentrate and finished goods businesses. Other costs, including wages, transportation, media and operating expenses, are also increasing and adding incremental pressures. The consolidation of the BODYARMOR finished goods business will continue to have a mechanical effect on margins, partially offset by the impact of refranchising our Vietnam and Cambodia bottling operations. And lastly, given the backdrop of rising interest rates, we expect to see an impact on our interest expense given our exposure to floating rate debt. As we enter the second half of the year, we continue to raise the bar in every aspect of how we do business. And we feel confident in our ability to effectively navigate this dynamic global environment and deliver on our updated guidance for 2022. Along with our bottling partners, we remain focused on the compelling growth opportunity our industry offers, and we are investing and creating flexibility in the business by taking actions on those things within our control. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane : So really wanted to touch on both. James and John, you talked a little bit about the second half and watching the consumer. And again, having had such a strong first half, your guidance for the full year implies a slowdown to, I guess, somewhere around 7%-or-so organic sales growth. And so can you just touch on a little bit how you've maybe risk-adjusted the second half versus the first half? Is it a reflection of, a, expectation that macro environment or the consumer may weaken or are there other considerations that kind of got -- kind of are underneath that sort of deceleration that's implied in the guidance? And if you can maybe talk a little bit about maybe where the risks are geographically also, that would help.\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure, Brian. Let me start off kind of by zooming out and then come back to the consumer and the uncertainty in the downhill. And that is -- in the end, it's going to be 2 ways underlining the kind of the relatively atypical point we are, given the end of COVID and the kind of post-COVID era. And where I'm going with that is to start by zooming out and saying, look, if you were to take a 3-year or a 5-year compound annual growth rate and look at the first half and what's implied in the second half guidance, you wouldn't see as much choppiness as you're seeing when you compare to prior year, and that's all related to COVID. In fact, if you take the 3-year or 5-year compound annual growth rate and look backwards and through the amazing roll coaster of volume and down and then up and price down then up, what you actually see is something simpler and more encouraging, which is that the volume has grown at 2 and a bit and the price has grown at 3 and a bit, whichever of those 2-time periods you've taken, so you net out at about 6. And so what you see over that long time period is the thesis we've been advancing, which is we've got an industry that grows at 4-ish percent. We are the leader that gain share with our portfolio, whether our RGM with our execution, and therefore, we can get to the top end of our long-term growth model. And if you zoom out, that's the kind of picture that you can see. And I would encourage people to not get too lost in the weeds to start with in trying to figure out the second half or even maybe the future and start with kind of starting from a macro position and saying like what does that look like when you kind of look through on a longer-term basis. And I think that will help people think about the downhill. The second thing I would say about those, we don't know how it's going to turn out. There's clearly a set of things going on and the net impact is difficult to predict in terms of the rest of the year. One, we've clearly, in some parts of the world, got a squeeze on purchasing power, and higher inflation is running ahead of wages. That's true in many places, U.S., Europe. It's not universally true. The inflation in China and Southeast Asia is only running at 3%. But there's clearly a big part of the world where there's a purchasing power squeeze. But at the same time, you've got relatively stable deposit balances. And you've got a big, very atypical reprioritization of spend occurring by consumers. And that's an important feature of how to see what the consumer is doing, because whilst there are a number of channels and categories where things look a little tougher in the short term. So if you're looking in grocery in the developed markets, if you're looking at some of the convenience channels in developed markets, you're seeing some pressure on consumers with less income, some early signs of trading down, depending on which category you're in, not necessarily in beverages yet. That's not to be -- that's to be expected. But then if you're in the away-from-home channels, the theme parks, the leisure parks, that sort of thing, travel, it's about as good as it's ever been. And so this post-COVID reprioritization of spend by consumers is layered over what feels like a squeeze on purchasing power. Whether it's a recession with peak employment is yet to be seen, but there's a kind of a standard process going on a squeezing purchase path, layered over with this weird or atypical consumer reprioritization post-COVID. How that's all going to net out in the second half and going into next year? There are a lot of opinions. I don't think anyone is going to know until we actually get there. But let me zoom back out again. The long picture is a stable sustained and accelerated momentum for the Coke system over a good number of years that we feel good about going into the downhill.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: So just 2 follow-ups on that. A, can you just give us a sense of how much of the full year top line raise was due to price/mix versus volume specifically and just break it out between those 2 factors? And then B, just any update on if towards the end of the quarter in July, if you saw any of that potential squeeze in consumer purchasing power play out? Obviously, in aggregate, very strong top line numbers, but are there any regions maybe where you're seeing either demand drop off or signs of consumer trade down? It'd be helpful to get a bit of a compare and contrast regionally and if there are any initial sites.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean, firstly, we don't break out price/mix and volume in the downhill. I'm expecting it to be a balance. We clearly are expecting to get both volume growth and price/mix growth going into the downhill. I would just underline again partly the commentary I made on the last answer, which is the price/mix that you see in the year-to-date, some of that is rate increase, but actually, slightly more than half is mix, whether it's geographic or away-from-home recovering relative at home. So there are a couple of big profound effects going on. So you've got to lay it over that right with reopenings and shifts in countries and shift in channels, which are very important. But we're expecting a balance of volume and price into the downhill, not just because we continue to be biased towards investing for growth, but we are very focused on in an expected squeeze on purchasing power to anchor ourselves in affordability to keep focus through the brand investments, through the revenue growth management strategies to keep the entry price points for the categories and for the packages as low as we can to keep the consumer base. We've talked about this strategy before. It's one of our playbooks. It works for us. We believe it's very important to push ahead. Of course, we balance that out with a focus on premiumization opportunities, and it's what we're going to focus into as we go into the downhill. As I said, we have not yet experienced a very significant or a significant pullback from the consumer that's not surprising to us at this stage. If there were a recessionary environment or in some countries, 1 country, more countries, a typical recessionary pattern in past experience would be consumers initially stop buying high-ticket item, discretionary things. I'll replace the car later. I\u2019ll replace the mattress later. They then start saving on the lower ticket items and they trade down in categoies which have weaker leader brands and then eventually might hit the grocery categories with strong leader brands and the away-from-home. So we came to have some lead time going into some normal recession, we have not seen large effects of that yet, even though, as I said, you can see in some channels, in some countries, what looks like the beginnings of that process, it has not gone to us yet. But as I said in the beginning, the overlay from that, a reprioritization of spend which is, I think, confusing or making hard to read whether it truly is \u201cas normal recession\u201d or it's just a reprioritization of spend away from typical things into things I missed out on in the last couple of years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: James, you've commented before on the view that the company is taking on pricing and pricing ahead of a recession. I was curious, given your -- just your comments on still not seeing any signs, you typically have some lead time for the business and in your categories before there would be impacts from consumer softness. Where do you feel you stand on pricing at this point? I know it's a big world, so it may be hard to give one blanket answer. But it would be great if you could give some context by larger markets where you stand on pricing if you feel like you're in the right place given the level of cost inflation.\nJames Quincey: Yes. I mean, as you say, there's not a one size fits all. We've rather atypically got relatively high inflation in the U.S. and Europe with the kind of 8% to 10%, and there are emerging markets that are down at 3%. So it's not a normal time. We obviously have a lot of experience. I won't go over our RGM strategy and how we use that to manage through maintaining affordability. What you see -- and let me make a couple of points here. One, it's important to consider in the headline price/mix that we're reporting that a big component of price/mix in the first half is mix. Unusually, relative to the past and pre-COVID, mix is an important factor, both from a country point of view and from a channel point of view. And both are favoring reported price/mix at the moment. So underlying rate increases, if you like, are not as high as the price/mix number. And they are in the ballpark of slightly behind inflation. And the reason that -- and that's relatively typical as well. So that's not surprising to us because what we essentially try to do as -- firstly, as I commented before, is we don't want to get behind passing cost increases through. We don't want to arrive a recession with a big buildup of cost increases that has not gone through, but nor do we get ahead and anticipate inflation by pricing ahead of it. And so that the rates increases are kind of in the ballpark of inflation would be the normal expected kind of trajectory. And so what we're seeing is, yes, we've been passing through the commodity increases. Again, we don't price -- we don't pass through to the peak. We're not chasing the spot market. We are hedged on commodities. And so as the prices come up, clearly, we know when the hedges are going to roll off, and we need to pass through those. But the commodities are not the majority of the cost base. We've got a lot of service and other inputs, and we are seeing broader-based inflation than just commodities up and down. And so as those come through, we pass them through. And so we've passed a good bit through so far this year. We anticipate more cost increases will come through on a broad-based set of inputs. And we will continue locally in each country because it's very different. We will continue to pass those through. And what that's likely to look like in terms of rate is we'll kind of be at inflation or slightly behind headline inflation as it goes up with the layover of price/mix.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Yes, I think this question is probably for John. And congrats, John, on the new role. But I guess I was hoping you could give us just maybe a bit more insight into your line of sight into productivity and cost savings over the balance of the year and whether the philosophy from here is still more to reinvest those savings to drive profit growth through accelerated revenue and expense leverage. Or whether, given the higher inflationary pressure that you called out and the prospects of deteriorating demand on the horizon, the philosophy is now biasing at all more towards harvesting those cost savings and dropping them more straight through to profit? Just some context there. And then if you could also comment at all as to how your investment priorities may be shifting in this environment, that would be helpful as well.\nJohn Murphy: Sure. Thanks, Steve. Yes, I think I mentioned in the script that as we look to the second half of the year, we look to continue the momentum that we have enjoyed year-to-date so far. And we're very focused on providing the resources to our markets and to our brands to continue to sustain that momentum. So the clear bias is to support the top line as we go forward. When I look at the overall cost base, there's a number of factors, I think, to take into account. As James highlighted, we do have broad-based increases across the board, not only on the core commodities but other inputs into our concentrate business. And we have -- we're taking on board inflationary increases in operating expenses and even our marketing expenses. We do have an ongoing focus on productivity, and there's a number of levers that we've discussed in the past. We have -- I think we've been able to leverage the scale of our network. We've been able to build, deepened even more strategic relationships with a number of our key supply partners across the world over the last couple of years, one of the benefits of COVID. And we're taking actions to simplify and streamline the way we do business. And so you can expect us to continue to drive productivity across the board. But the guidance that we've given this morning, I think, is reflective of the overarching bias to continue to invest to support the top line and to continue to take actions across the board to mitigate against those inflationary pressures that we're seeing in a number of key areas.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kaumal Gajrawala from Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: John, congratulations. For a few years now, you've talked about dollar-based EPS growth. And James, you mentioned it again, the commitment to growing in dollar terms in your prepared remarks. Can you maybe talk about what new maybe policies or procedures you have in place to try to accomplish that? Or perhaps how things might be different if we go through another period of years of dollar strengthening versus the last cycle?\nJames Quincey: Yes. I mean very much -- let me start by reading them. Our goals are to, on a continuous basis, strengthen the strategic position of the Coke Company and to deliver ultimately, when all said and done, increases in dollar EPS back to the shareholders. And so that is the North Star, and we've broken that out into all the strategies necessary to make that a reality. And that's what we're going to continue to pursue. Clearly, at the moment, we're focused on increasing our ability, both the resilience to face up to what could be yet further unexpected twists and turns in the coming months or even years, and adaptability. One of the features of the COVID crisis was the amount of learning that took place to be able to respond to the lockdowns. So the first lockdown was very painful. The second one, less so and onwards and onwards. And actually, in the second quarter, there was a considerable lockdown in China. China was negative in volume each month through the second quarter. And yet, we were able to both accommodate that and manage through it in China and mitigate it at a total company point of view. So bear in mind, Q2 had both the disappearance of the Russian business and a quite negative China business due to the lockdown. So this idea of focusing -- continuing to focus on the strategy that has been guiding us for the last number of years with a double-down on both resilience and adaptability, we feel, is going to give us the wherewithal to manage through the twists and turns that are yet ahead of us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: I guess I have a question on your guidance. Could you give us a sense of the scenarios you considered in your new updated guidance in terms of a potential recession and whether you've considered a severe scenario? And then how should we think about your business relative to peers given you over-indexed to the on-premise channel? James, you touched on this, but just curious to hear if you see a greater potential risk on your business as consumers potentially pull back on dining out and entertainment. And if so, is this considered in your guidance? And then maybe just touch on the strategy you can implement to mitigate this.\nJames Quincey: Look, in preparing the guidance and thinking about our way forward, we've considered a whole number of potential scenarios. What we feel is -- the most likely is what we've reflected in the guidance. Clearly, there's a lot of uncertainty, which is why rather than having our operators focus on debating which scenario do they think is right, we said, \"Look, let's lean into growth.\" We've been growing coming out of last year. We're growing in each of the quarters this year. We're still growing. So let's maintain our bias to growth and keep going. And in the meantime, make sure that we're doubling down on resilience and adaptability for whatever is going to come. And that may end up being different by region in the world and by country in the world. Certainly, overall and in time as well, the recessions, if they arrive, generally are not completely the same everywhere. And so it's very much, we have a bias to growth and we're going to focus on resilience and adaptability. I think the fact that our businesses, in round numbers, half at home and half away from home, clearly, at the moment, is favorable. Clearly, it was a disadvantage at the height of COVID. Experience of recession says that we have a great business system that can see us through. Let me reinforce again, and when you zoom out and you think of all that's happened in the last 5 years, and you say, \"Well, what's the net number for the Coke system or the Coke Company?\" The organic revenue growth is, in round numbers, about 6%. And so we have seen our way through, and that's what we're focused on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Congrats to John. My question is on the potential for increasing the concentrate incidence cost for some of the bottlers that operate in a high inflationary environment. I believe Arca spoke to higher concentrate costs, but I was just checking if this is more a flow-through from the pricing and the percentage there and -- or some adjustments to the puts and takes of inflation. And just a clarification on your commentary about Europe in general. You're seeing on-premise keeping the momentum or you're seeing any exit rate there as had been more moderate embedded in your guidance?\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Andreas. So on the last point, I think as James highlighted, we're not seeing any significant changes on that front, so very much focused on continuing to drive the momentum. With regard to the whole topic of how we work with our bottling partners, as I think many of you on the call understand and appreciate, we have an economic model that is under-led by instance pricing. That pricing allows both of us to focus on growth in the marketplace and allows greater certainty as to what to expect from our activities in the marketplace. And as we work through periods of high growth, low growth, volatility, stability, the model doesn't change that much. It's what allows us to -- I think, to stay focused on delivering what we need to in whatever the context is. So not a -- there's not a lot to report out on changes. I think the model itself is actually what allows us to -- one of the reasons that allows us to continue to deliver on the opportunities that the industry has that we've talked about and allows us to continue to be optimistic about sustaining momentum.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore ISI.\nRob Ottenstein: I just first wanted to follow up on the question on the bottling system. Can you just maybe, number one, talk a little bit about Swire and kind of the thought pattern there? where you stand on the refranchising in general. And then just more specifically on the pricing, you talked about leaning into growth. How does that play into the pressures that are on the bottlers themselves? I mean, obviously, with the incident pricing, you both share, but presumably, the bottlers are getting hurt a little bit more in a number of countries from inflation. So how does the discussion work between you and the bottlers in terms of how much pricing is appropriate?\nJames Quincey: Yes. I mean, look, the conversation in any given country on the pricing strategy is clearly a conversation where we're trying to bring some strategic start with the consumer, brand thinking, some RGM technology integrated with the way the bottles see RGM. We are both exposed to cost basis, yes, difference in nature. We both very much have the idea. The costs, ultimately, if there's an inflationary environment, then those costs are going to have to be passed through in some way, shape or form through to the consumer pricing, and we work very hard to do that. And so I think if you look around the world, you'll see that the bottlers are in good health. The bottlers are in good health, not just in the developed markets, but the bottlers in the emerging markets where there has been a history of higher inflation and even some of the ones where there's very high inflation currently, the bottlers are in good shape. And let me underline that the incidence model, the model that John talked about, was essentially invented in an environment of high inflation and was invented to help the system stay focused on the consumer and the retailers and creating value for everyone in times of high inflation and volatility. In a way, it was designed for exactly the sorts of situations we're in. So this is a muscle that is well developed in the Coke system, in the company and in the bottlers. And it has proven to be very effective in helping us stay focused on the marketplace and to work together to achieve what we need to achieve in terms of the brand investments, in terms of the RGM strategy and in terms of the marketplace investments. And that's why I think ultimately, both the company and the bottlers are in good shape post-COVID and good shape as we stand here at the middle of 2022. And so I think that's the most important thing. And then I think Swire was the right partner for Vietnam and Cambodia. And then obviously, we're left with very little of the global bottling system, predominantly some of the operations we own in India and then CCBA.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey: So my question is actually on BODYARMOR. The outlook was slightly lowered today for both sales and profit. We've seen some normalization in scanner trends for the brand. So I wonder if you could just give a bit of a state of the union and again, some of the developments that you're seeing both on top line and bottom line for that specific offering.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Just to clear, we didn't provide any guidance for BODYARMOR itself. And clearly, we've been -- it's a great brand. It's high growth with strong innovation. It's done a great job of reinvigorating the advanced hydration and bringing people into the sports drink category. We are lapping some disruption in the category from last year, and that's obviously had some kind of effect on the comparisons. And I think we're in good shape. We're in the process of kind of fully connecting it to the Coke system and continuing to drive it forward and continuing to do what the brand needs to do and keep it true to itself. And as and when we've got international opportunities, we will address those over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Congrats on strong results. James, a question for you. You kind of touched on some of this, but maybe not directly. It's on your U.S. business and potential implications from some of the margin pressures we're seeing very publicly from large retail customers. So understanding those issues are more around general merchandise than grocery, but nevertheless, notable margin compression, which I'm sure cannot, should not go unnoticed by any large suppliers or anyone in the industry for that matter. Just comment on potential implications from your business in categories where you participate, whether this is potentially less ability to take price if it's called for, greater likelihood of demands on trade dollars. So the question is very specific. I do not ask you to be redundant because I think it was Lauren's question, you talked a little bit about pricing. But the question is very specifically on any fallout you may see from the margin pressure we're seeing at large retail customers in the U.S.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Look, whether it's the U.S. or other parts of the world, as retailers come under pressure from the consumers' wallet pullbacks, whether it's because they're losing purchasing power or they're reprioritizing their spend from something in that store to a different store, clearly, there will be pressure. And the way we approach it is to take a value creation point of view. Our idea is like, look, we're investing in our brands to create value for the consumers that the retailers can realize in their stores. And therefore, we've got to focus on making the category attractive to bring the consumers in, to generate value from those consumers to the retailers. And ideally, our category would grow faster than their average business, and they would do well out of it. Of course, we would like to see ourselves gain share within those category growth. So very much, we're focused on driving a growth story, a growth story that creates value for everyone who touches the business. If there's going to be a much more recessionary environment ahead of us, clearly, it's going to get difficult around. But as we sit here today, we've been able to drive growth, as I said, for the consumer, growth for the retailers. And I think that's what we bring to the table, which is creating something that's really working for them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge Research.\nBrett Cooper: Question for you on developed markets and price/mix. The place where we can see the best number is in North America. And your price/mix in 2Q or year-to-date is up more than 20% from 2019. In the off-premise data, we can see that 20-ounce is now selling for about $2 a bottle. So the question is whether the rapid rise in consumer prices requires a meaningful shift in package mix in order to try to hit key price points like you've done in other markets, in order to drive recruitment and retainment over the medium term? And then if you can just offer some color on how you can segment the market so that you don't generate trade down from what has been a profitable pack.\nJames Quincey: I mean we're getting right down into the -- some of the packaging stuff. Look, the price/mix, I think, is very important to try and disaggregate channel and category pricing changes. You alluded to something on the 20-ounce. I presume that was in a specific channel. And we very much are focused on driving not just, as I said, consumer value, but also we were going to take rate, but we do focus on, as we've talked about many times, retaining affordability whilst also looking for premiumization. And whether 1 pack is going up in price, then clearly, that's probably more of the premiumization strategy where the other packs will be looking to stay anchored in affordability, whether they be individual pack sizes or multipacks. And we use different pack sizes and different combinations of multipacks to move across the spectrum of what price point is going to work for which consumers. And therefore, the key in that dynamic is to increase the diversity of the packaging mix. It's almost impossible to segment and resegment the marketplace with only 1 or 2 package slices. So the important factor becomes the diversity in the number of packaging size or material options and the diversity of the multipack options. That's the dynamic that allows you to play across the spectrum of price points and elasticities. And so one going up. There's probably another one staying anchored that allows us to do the strategy. But I think the most important is the overall dynamic of using the diversification of the packages, the growth in the mini cans, the introduction of some smaller-sized PET bottles to be able to capture the whole kind of demand curve spectrum.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities.\nBill Chappell: Just kind of a follow-up on the pack sizes. I mean, one of the things you had said was you've benefited from country mix and, I guess, product mix, but not necessarily pack mix. And I would think that as the higher prices are being flowed through, maybe you have some acceleration to smaller pack sizes, which are higher margin? So I guess is that -- are you seeing any of that? And if not, if you're not seeing any trade down, is there any reason down the road in the back half if commodity prices come down, you would roll back any of these price increases? Or do you feel like, hey, there's no real elasticity. We're just going to hold the line here.\nJames Quincey: Okay. Let me try and unpack that a bit and start at the end. I commented earlier, we don't price to commodity spikes. So there are some commodities that shot up from January through to March and then come back down again. We didn't chase the commodity price up. Because we use a hedging program and long-term relationships, we have a lot of -- and many of our bottlers too, we have a smooth curve, if you like, on the pricing of commodities. So what's important there is the overall underlying trend in the commodity price, not the spot market. And so we haven't priced up. Now having said that, commodities -- the basket of commodities, particularly energy and some other ones, still is trending up and so are services and labor. So I don't think -- I don't foresee the total basket of imports, whether they'd be the sum of the commodities or the sum of the services and other imports, suddenly being in a deflationary environment. I mean, if you take the commodities and not the majority of the cost but the services and everything else, basically, for the price to have to roll back, we need the overall economy to enter deflation before it's even really a question, which does not seem the most likely scenario in the short term, certainly not on a global basis. So I think price rollbacks in that sense, seems very unlikely. I think we're much -- it's more likely that inflation softens, and therefore, the rate of increase can come down, but I don't foresee a big global deflationary burst at the moment. In terms of the -- I didn't mention pack mix as one of the mixed things. Well, clearly, a channel mix is intimately related to pack mix. So away-from-home rather -- versus at home, that being a positive mix effect for price is somewhat synonymous to we've got more IC packs, immediate consumption packs, than we have larger packs. And so the 2 -- they're not the same, but they are relatively correlated. So for example, in the U.S., the reopening has increased fountain, has increased smaller pack sizes as people travel. So pack size very much goal with channel mix, not the same, but there's a reasonably close correlation.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.\nJames Quincey: Great. Thanks very much, everyone. Clearly, we feel our second quarter exemplified the strength of our brands, the execution of our bottlers and the momentum in our business. We're pleased with the performance so far in the first half. We entered the second half with confidence that we can sustain value for the long run. And thanks for your interest, investment in the company and for joining us this morning.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "KO", "quarter": 1, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-04-25 12:14:02", "content": "Operator: At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to The Coca-Cola Company's First Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Leveridge, Vice President of IR and FP&A. Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.\nTim Leveridge: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our Chief Financial Officer. Note that we\u2019ve posted schedules under Financial Information in the Investors section of our company website at www.coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our gross and operating margins. In addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC reports. Following prepared remarks this morning, we'll turn the call over for questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing one first and then re-enter the queue. Now I'll turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. First and foremost, on behalf of our company and our entire system, I'd like to share our deepest sympathies to all those who have been affected by what's happening in Ukraine. The safety of our people and their families continues to be our top priority. And as we highlighted in our release this morning, we are taking actions to provide that support. Now this morning, I'll discuss how we drove strong results in the quarter and that we are reiterating our guidance even in the face of incremental challenges. Then John will discuss the financial details of the quarter and how our work has prepared us for whatever may be around the corner. We all know that much has happened in the world since we last talked with you in February, leading, for sure, to an operating environment that is fast changing and increasingly complex. However, we remain confident about the future and are well equipped to manage external factors worldwide through our strengthened leadership position with the right portfolio, the right strategy and the right execution in the marketplace. After a promising start to the year, the operating environment soon changed with very significant geopolitical conflict, a resurgence of COVID in various places, record-high inflation and continued challenges on the supply chain front. Nonetheless, we've consistently sustained our momentum from last year, moving with agility as conditions changed to generate strong top and bottom line growth in the quarter. We delivered 8% unit case volume growth, primarily driven by strong recovery in away-from-home channels and continued growth in our home channels. Volume growth was strong across all operating segments, driven by marketing investments and aided by an increase in consumer mobility as the impact of the pandemic abated in most regions. Our enhanced capabilities helped us gain value share overall in both at-home and away-from-home channels globally and across most of our geographic operating segments, a clear indicator of the power of our new approach. Amidst the dynamic macro conditions and an inflationary cost backdrop, we focused on delivering growth. The key competitive edge of The Coca-Cola system continues to be the ability to deliver value for our consumers and our customers in any environment. Our accelerated agenda in marketing and innovation is tying our beverages to daily consumption occasions, adding and creating value for our brands. Additionally, we continue to work with our bottling partners to expand package offerings and strengthen distribution to capture growth opportunities, using all the available revenue growth management levers, including price, to win in the marketplace. These scaled global initiatives are coming to life at a local level all around the world. So let's start with Asia Pacific. In India, we drove excellence in integrated execution as consumer mobility improved across channels by stepping up product availability, adding approximately 240,000 outlets and over 50,000 coolers. We also continue to build relevance through innovation by launching Maaza Aam Panna to leverage our equity in Mango and Fanta Apple to expand our footprint in the fast-growing fruit-flavored sparkling subcategory. Japan is emerging from its extended state of emergency, and we've increased our consumer base and driven market share gains in key categories. The Coke ON app reached 35 million app downloads, continuing the direct engagement with consumers to create and capture value. We also continued our focus on ESG initiatives with 100% recycled PET bottles now available in Japan for 5 key brands, including Coke and Georgia Coffee. In China, a strong start in January, led by an excellent Chinese New Year brand activation with Coke, was followed by strict COVID lockdowns, and this resulted in reduced consumer mobility. Momentum reversed in February and March and led to a decline in unit case volume during the quarter. We're moving fast to focus on core SKUs and ensure product availability. We're adapting how we engage with consumers depending upon local market conditions, and we're working in close collaboration with our bottling partners to focus on execution basics like increasing multipack availability and maximizing share of visible inventory in channels and regions that are open. In ASEAN and South Pacific, we gained share in key countries and across most categories, while consumer mobility was mixed and supply chain headwinds remained. Growth was led by Trademark Coke and sparkling flavors, driven by strong end-to-end execution of the [Zero Words] (ph), Sprite Heat Happens and the Fanta Colorful People brand campaigns. In EMEA, notwithstanding the conflict in Ukraine and an uptick in inflation, we delivered a strong performance in Europe in the quarter. The continued rollout of new and improved Coca-Cola Zero Sugar across key markets helped drive 5 percentage points of sparkling single-serve mix growth, which is ahead of pre-pandemic levels. Topo Chico Hard Seltzer is closing the gap with the #1 hard seltzer brand in Europe, and the eB2B business with myccep.com accounted for low double-digit contribution to total revenue. We are keeping a close watch on the spillover reflex of the conflict in Ukraine on the health of the consumer, and we remain ready to pivot and adapt. In Africa, macroeconomic recovery is underway, although conditions remain challenging due to inflationary pressure. In South Africa, we accelerated refillable PET expansion and the execution of in-store sampling to retain consumers. We are connecting with our existing customers in the digital space and have surpassed 65,000 outlets on the Wabi eB2B platform, significantly ahead of plan. Despite macro volatility and intense inflation in the region, Eurasia and Middle East drove top line growth through a strong suite of marketing programs across categories, led by sparkling and ready-to-drink tea. In Turkey, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar became the #2 immediate consumption player in value share behind brand Coke. In Pakistan, Coke Studio, a platform that unites diverse cultures through the power of music, drove social engagement that reached an all-time high in terms of impressions and viewings. In North America, we are seeing more inflation and continue to navigate supply chain dynamics. We're closely monitoring further pressure in some inputs such as high fructose corn syrup, PET and metals, along with wages and transportation as they impact us as well as our bottling partners. Despite these challenges, we continue to gain share in both at-home and away-from-home channels and across most categories. The strong rollout of Real Magic platform and the successful launch of Coke Starlight resulted in Coke Trademark being the fastest-growing trademark in measured retail, driving household penetration up a full point. Powerade [posed its power] (ph) launch during NCAA March Madness, generating more than 1 billion impressions. We also continue to learn from the returnable glass-bottled pilot that has been implemented in the Southwest. In Latin America, we delivered strong performance despite challenging macro conditions, and the investments we made to sustain momentum are paying off. We remain focused on integrated execution and drove revenue growth faster than transaction growth, both of which grew faster than unit case volume growth. Our work to strengthen the traditional trade is paying off as the channel showed the best underlying performance across all channels. The Prospera loyalty program added nearly 50,000 retailers in the quarter while continuing to advance our customer-focused digital expansion. Notably, we have digitized nearly 2 million customers in the region, and we are leveraging the strong system alignment with our bottling partners and are continuing to execute for growth. Within Global Ventures, despite an inflationary backdrop in the UK, Costa continued to recover driven by retail and strong like-for-like sales with Costa Express. In China, while retail sales were impacted by store closures due to the pandemic, Costa ready-to-drink coffee sustained its #2 position and continue to innovate with Costa chart. Finally, our Bottling Investments Group delivered strong Q1 performance, driven by the expansion of affordable immediate consumption entry packs in key markets, and this resulted in share gains in sparkling. We also continue to make progress towards optimizing trade promotions and cost to serve in our key markets and raise the bar on operational excellence. Clearly, the operating environment has proven to be more challenging, but we're pleased with the results we delivered in the first quarter. We continue to believe the recovery in 2022 will be asynchronous. We anticipate many new chapters and challenges, including, but not limited to, ongoing geopolitical conflict; uncertain consumer sentiment amidst the increasingly inflationary environment, accelerated cost pressures and ongoing supply challenges; and of course, continued evolution of pandemic. That said, the changes we have made during the pandemic have left us better positioned than ever to capture growth, increasing our confidence in the future. The multiple levers of revenue growth management have never been more important, and our investments in building this capability over the past few years are giving us a clear advantage. Further actions on pricing will depend on the consumer and inflationary environment as the year progresses, but we will continue to rely on a mix of price, package differentiation and ever-sharper promotional strategies. Through integrated RGM and execution capabilities, we adapt to local market conditions and give consumers what they want, where they want it and at the right price. By extending package offerings to keep transaction driving price points in play, we retain consumers through affordability while also driving premiumization with innovation and targeted pricing. For example, in Latin America, we are continuing the expansion of refillables to sparkling flavors and juices, and this remains a compelling consumer proposition to address the need for affordability. In North America, we're maximizing value by initiatives like the one expanding the availability of mini cans for consumption across occasions such as breaks and meals and by offering 6 packs, 10 packs and 30 packs, driving an approximate 45% increase in retail dollars in measured channels and their near-20% increase in total distribution points. Our networked organization structure extends to our system. Our bottling partners complement our progress against our capabilities by continuing to invest in the marketplace, and they help put our purpose into action. We have strong partners with highly capable and experienced leadership, and we continue to build and foster our business and each in our relationship that drive system health and long-term growth opportunities. With our purpose to refresh the world to make a difference, we continue to focus our ESG work on issues where we can have a measurable positive impact on communities as well as create opportunities for our business to grow. We release our fourth combined business and ESG report tomorrow, an integrated approach to reporting that is a strong demonstration of how sustainability is linked to our business, builds resilience and demonstrates transparency. We have a long history of assuring select sustainability metrics while also providing key public disclosures against the TCFD recommendations as well as other reporting frameworks such as SASB, GRI and the UN Global Compact. In the report, we highlight how we and our bottling partners are driving business growth through our interconnected ESG goals and how we continue to seek an exponentially greater impact by fostering collective action, partnering across industry, government and society to address shared challenges. In conclusion, while there is no doubt the world is more uncertain and the operating environment remains highly dynamic, our strategy remains the same: to execute for sustainable growth through strengthened capabilities in innovation, marketing, RGM and execution. Now I'll turn the call over to John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll highlight our first quarter performance and discuss our full year 2022 earnings guidance; then I'll provide commentary on the overall operating environment and how our organization is navigating effectively to drive results. Let me first start by saying how pleased we are with the results in the first quarter. We delivered strong organic revenue growth of 18%; unit cases grew 8%, with strong growth across all operating segments; concentrate sales were ahead of unit cases by 3 points in the quarter, primarily due to the timing of shipments in Latin America and EMEA. Our price/mix of 7% was driven by strategic pricing, revenue growth management initiatives, further improvement in away-from-home channels in most markets and positive segment mix. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 90 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to the impact of 2 items: one, consolidating the BODYARMOR; and two, currency headwinds. Underlying gross margin expanded despite continued pressure from commodity costs, due to pricing actions in the market and a benefit from the timing of concentrate shipments. We continue to prioritize consumer-facing marketing to maximize returns while driving productivity in our operating costs leading to leverage in the P&L. Comparable operating margin expanded by approximately 50 basis points despite acquisition and currency headwinds. First quarter comparable EPS of $0.64 grew 16% year-over-year. This was driven by strong top line growth which benefited from the timing of concentrate shipments and operating margin improvements, partially offset by currency and cost headwinds. On the cash flow front, we delivered free cash flow of approximately $400 million in the first quarter as our strong business performance was more than offset primarily by 2 items: one, cycling the timing of working capital benefits in the prior year; and two, higher 2021 annual incentives paid in the first quarter. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our cash flow goals for the full year. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, with net debt leverage within our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x. As James mentioned, much has happened since we last gave guidance in February. The conflict in Ukraine has created further volatility in the world as well as added to the inflationary backdrop and impacted the currency market. The resurgence of COVID in China and some other geographies around the world is a clear indication that the pandemic is still very much a part of the conversation, and a reminder that the recovery path has been and will continue to be asynchronous. Obviously, there are lots of puts and takes at play, and we see a number of potential futures coming at us. But notwithstanding this backdrop, we believe our organization is better prepared today, and we're confident in the flexibility we've built and our ability to manage what's around the corner. We continue to spin the growth flywheels faster, and our local businesses are adapting and executing for growth. With that in mind, this morning, we are reiterating our guidance for 2022. We continue to expect organic revenue growth of approximately 7% to 8% and comparable currency-neutral earnings per share guidance of 8% to 10% growth versus 2021. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we are reiterating our currency outlook of a 2- to 3-point currency headwinds to comparable net revenues and a 3- to 4-point currency headwinds to comparable earnings per share for full year 2022. Additionally, taking into account our current understanding of recently issued regulations, we now expect an effective tax rate of 19.5% in 2022 versus the 20% that we had guided to previously. All in, we continue to expect comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus 2021. And we continue to expect to generate approximately $10.5 billion of free cash flow for 2022 through approximately $12 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments. To put this guidance in context, there are some considerations to keep in mind for 2022. The direct impact of the Ukraine conflict and the resulting suspension of business in Russia is estimated to be approximately $0.04 to comparable EPS. The recent increases in commodity costs are having an incremental effect. But based on current rates and hedge positions, we expect the commodity price inflation to remain in the range of mid-single digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2022. Additionally, we see incremental cost pressure coming from areas like wages and transportation. The consolidation of the BODYARMOR finished goods business will continue to have a mechanical effect on margins. When it comes to capital allocation, our priorities remain the same, and we continue to balance financial flexibility with efficient capital structure. For 2022, we announced a dividend increase of 5%, a higher rate than in recent years; and we also announced the resumption of share repurchases with approximately $500 million in net share repurchases expected this year. Despite uncertainties around the world, our strategic transformation has fortified the organization to weather the storm, and we are extremely proud of how our people are responding and delivering. We are keeping consumers at the center, operating more effectively and efficiently and unlocking the immense potential of our growth portfolio of brands. This gives us confidence that we can deliver on our guidance for 2022. And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: I was hoping we could talk a little bit more about Latin America, an area like you called out about performance, in particular, Mexico and Brazil this quarter. And I had sort of 2 sets of questions. One is this is a region where your partnership with bottling has been particularly strong certainly versus the past. And if you could talk a little bit about how that may be enabling your ability to be performing as well as you are in this challenging time. So that's kind of one. And then two was there was a mention in the release about shares being down. It looked -- I'm guessing it might be in juice because I think you talked about sparkling being up, but anything in particular you're doing or the degree to which the market share performance is an area, a watch point for you and how you're balancing that versus thinking about recovering cost inflation.\nJames Quincey: Yes. There was -- I think we'll call that several questions.\nLauren Lieberman: I never do it, though. So I'm sorry. It's the first time.\nJames Quincey: Okay. We'll be -- in the spirit of generosity, we'll try and -- because they're very related. Look, we have a great partnership with our bottlers in Latin America from the 2 very big ones. Coke FEMSA, Arca Continental, through Andina and some of the more country-based bottlers. And we have developed collectively the system, many capabilities on many fronts, whether it be marketing automation, but particularly, the levers of revenue growth management and execution in volatile times. It escapes no one's attention that Latin America was a place that has had a rollercoaster of economic growth and inflation and difficulties. And we have a very deep partnership with these bottlers to work through these times. And that, I think, you see reflected in this quarter as we had a lot of good growth. The share did come in negative overall. I think there's a couple of things going on there. As you say, we did a lot better in sparkling, a lot of good execution in sparkling. And there was some pressure as much in juice or some of the juice drink categories, but also category mix. We are very much focused on, as we've talked about previously that when you are in a cost environment, that those cost increases, whether it be commodities or wages or logistics or marketing costs, need to go through over time. We have to earn the right for the brands to take if they need to go through. Sometimes when you're in a very high share market like Latin America and you lead on pricing, not all competitors necessarily follow immediately, and that can have temporary impacts on share. But we, with the bottlers, will be very focused on not only continuing to carry on growing, but to regain and expand our share position.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: So I just want to focus on top line visibility here. You obviously kept the full year top line guidance despite the Russia impact. So underlying sales are moving up ex Russia, and Q1 was another strong quarter. But clearly, there's risk consumer spending might weaken with the unprecedented inflation we're seeing. So first, maybe just looking backwards, can you give us an update on if you're seeing any signs of consumer stress in terms of impact on your business or pushback to higher pricing around the world, either late in Q1 or in April? And then also on a go-forward basis, can you juxtapose the positive impact of normalization of COVID behavior on your business as away-from-home recovers maybe versus any potential macro pressure you could see or consumer spending weakness? And how that impacts your visibility in terms of full year top line view?\nJames Quincey: Well, clearly, my active generosity, Lauren has unleashed a torrent of multi-question questions, but it would be harsh to cut it off at this stage, Dara. Look, a couple of things. We did come in with strong momentum out of 2021 and coming to this year. And as I and John and we talked about previously on calls, we believe that pricing for our business has to be earned for the brands. We have to give the consumer and the retailer reason for the price increase and for the value of our brands, whether it's the marketing, the innovation, the execution or the packaging options, we do that. It's not a cost-plus business, although we do seek, of course, to protect the margin structure by moving through changes in commodities and other costs.  But we very much foresee as experience and history -- who was it? Mark Twain said, history doesn't repeat itself, it just rhymes. But when you go into high inflation, consumers come under pressure. There's clearly reductions in real purchasing power going on for some segments of the population, if not everyone around the world. And so our focus is very much to find those packaging and price options by channel where we can stay connected to people who are coming under purchasing power pressure, very much the affordability just building on the Latin America example for the last question; a lot of focus on returnable, refillable bottles because the economics of those packages work to an extent that you can have a lower price point for the package. And with reductions in purchasing power, we very much see the actual out-of-pocket price point and keeping a low entry point into the category is very important, also pushing the expansion of refillables in places like South Africa. So very much acting on the signs of consumer purchasing power pressure, but very much also anticipating that it will increase. It would be great if there were a perfect landing out of this inflationary environment. The rhyme of history would tell you that at some point, either inflation or reduction in purchasing power or supply constraints eventually create a bump. And at that point, we will want to both be accessing the premium opportunities that have but very much with an anchor in the affordability and entry price point opportunities and necessities as consumers come under pressure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: When I think about -- just the approach to capital allocation and business reinvestment, as you talked about it in the prepared remarks, you framed it as essentially unchanged as a framework. But with all the variability you called out in the operating environment, I guess I'm curious as to where there are areas of your going in plans where maybe you pulled back a bit versus other areas where you found yourself now leading in more? Maybe James, to your answer to the last question, maybe it's affordability or something like that. But just again, overall all spending as you framed it and as the guidance implies seems intact but my sense is it's moving around a lot under the cover. So just I'm curious how that kind of agility is manifesting in terms of reallocations of spend.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Steve, it's John. Let me first just lay the picture of total capital allocation. The first priority is to invest in the business. And as we -- as James just said, when you think about the environment that we're -- we have been dealing in and we will be dealing with the rest of the year, the name of the game right now is to do exactly that is to continue to invest in our brands so that we have the wherewithal to manage through whatever comes at us. I think at a local level, the mix of investments is something that we continue to be very flexible with. And we are leveraging the work that we have been doing over the last couple of years to be even more effective in how we're spending our marketing dollars, whether it's on building our brands or whether it's on supporting our RGM efforts in the marketplace. The other areas of our capital allocation framework, supporting the dividend, looking at opportunistic M&A and share repurchase, we covered in the script with the dividend and share repurchase, we continue to be very open as to what opportunities may be out there. But in the here and now, the top priority is investing appropriately in the business. And as I say, the mix of that investment is something that varies and will continue to vary depending on what we need to do locally.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: I had just a big picture question about how you're working with your bottlers who are experiencing pretty sharp cost pressures to essentially help them navigate through this tough environment, if you guys could talk about that. And also looking at the equity income in the quarter, it remained relatively strong, but is the expectation going forward that there will be a greater impact in the next couple of quarters, given some of these pressures?\nJames Quincey: Yes. Sure, Bonnie. I mean I'm not sure it would be appropriate to comment on equity income into the future for our bottling partners. But as we go into a tough environment, as we always do historically, we make sure that we intensify our collaboration and partnership with our bottlers, both to work on what are the marketing programs and the innovation programs that are going to work in the consumer and the retail environment that we face wherever we are in the world, and also the execution initiatives and focus areas that bottlers can drive on. Because firstly, the environment is not the same in every country around the world. Some are opening up exuberantly and actually chasing and keeping up with demand and the kind of the reopening euphoria, all the way across the spectrum to parts of China like Shanghai, which is in full lockdown as though it were April 2020. So the environment is absolutely not the same in every country, and we have to work where on the curve of all the change, are we and be very clear. And in terms of the pressures, you talked about it, the pressure is both headwind and tailwind. Clearly, there are headwinds in terms of cost, whether it be commodities, logistics, wages. And as I said earlier in one of the questions, we work with our system, our bottling partners, to make sure we protect and sustain the margin structure over time. That's not necessarily true every single quarter, but that is our overall objective: earning the right to price the brands so that the system has the sort of margin structure and stability of that over the course of time, if not every single quarter. But there are headwinds there. Balancing those headwinds, there are tailwinds out there, as I said. The reopenings provide fuel not just for overall demand, but improvements in channels, away-from-home channels where we're strong and leaning in with investment produces great results. So this is -- there's a lot of variables at play in the downhill of the year and really just the key is the intense partnership with our bottlers to make the most of the opportunity ahead of us and to prepare ourselves for step 2 and step 3 further down the road.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: James, I wanted to just circle back to the comments you made in the prepared remarks about ESG and, I guess, tying it to comp. If I understood the proxy correctly, there\u2019s been 2 changes. One is the ESG component now being a portion of both the annual and long-term comp. I think it moves to 10%. And then also for your annual long-term incentive comp, the amount that's paid out in stock options, I think, goes up from like 1/3 to 1/2. So just wanted to sort of get your perspective on why make those changes now? And just what it signals about your focus going forward?\nJames Quincey: Yes. Thanks, Bryan. Yes, I mean, firstly, we'd refer everyone who wants a greater depth to the proxy that's out there on our website, and we've tried to lay out some of the mechanics and our thinking behind the 2. We have made some changes, as you point out, Bryan, to the way the long-term incentives or more specifically, the performance share units, which are kind of a 3-year program. We've got a 10% element in that that's linked to our ESG goals. And so we are laying out some very specific targets that will drive a portion of those payouts. And because some of those ESG objectives take some time to execute against, we felt they were better embedded into the 3-year stock award programs. And then secondly, as you point out, with the Board and with the Compensation Committee, we felt to increase greater alignment with shareowners. We would readjust the balance of performance share units versus options for myself and push that up to 50%. I mean you can take that as a confidence in the future, but that's one very small stone on the large pile of stones of things we do to demonstrate that we believe this is a great company with a great future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets.\nFilippo Falorni: This is Filippo Falorni on for Nick. My question is on pricing. Clearly, price realization has been very strong in the carbonated soft drink category and particularly North America with a very rational environment in the industry and pretty low elasticity so far. So can you comment how you balance the need to take pricing while ensuring affordability using price/pack architecture, your revenue growth management, given this inflationary environment, the impact on consumer wallets in North America and in other parts of the world? And then secondly, if you think you will see more promotional activity in the industry in the balance of the year.\nJames Quincey: I mean our approach to pricing, I've commented a little bit on it already. Firstly, the highest level principle is the brand has to earn the right for pricing. And that is the combination of its activities in marketing, in innovation, in execution and the investments in the store and of course, in RGM to make the packaging and pricing architecture fit the consumers' needs. Obviously, what goes into a piece of that puzzle is also the cost environment, whether that be commodities, marketing, logistics, et cetera, et cetera. And we seek to balance the various challenges using RGM. As I said earlier, clearly, as we go into reducing consumer purchasing power, we need to have affordability as front and center, and depending on where you are in the world, can take the shape of different packaging but it all becomes about the entry price point to the category, not the kind of the higher-end price towards the category. But you balance that out by having -- moving up the price points on other package combinations. It all has to go in the mix. And it is all done with a perspective that not necessarily every single day, but in a reasonable time frame, the margin structure of the system needs to be sustained. You definitely don't want to get to a point where there's been a substantial cost push through, and that has not yet been passed on into the marketplace when any recessionary impact appears. Trying to catch up on pricing in a recessionary environment is very hard. And so we have a bias to action. In the same way, we have a bias to invest behind our brands in marketing innovation. We have a bias to keep up with cost pressures as they occur. And that, of course, leads us to take pricing more or less frequently depending on where you are in the world, and I expect to see more of that in the rest of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: This should be a quick one and a single question. Is there any update on the tax litigation matter perhaps? Maybe not just on your end, but some of the other moving parts, I suppose, on what needs to happen there beforehand.\nJohn Murphy: Quick answer. No updates -- no developments during the quarter. We'll keep you posted as they happen.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlos Laboy from HSBC.\nCarlos Laboy: I was hoping you could give us an update on some of the stepped-up efforts on -- for renewable -- for refillable packages in Latin America and how that's going, please?\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. Thanks, Carlos. Clearly, as part of both our RGM initiatives, because the refillable, reusable packages tend to give you the opportunity especially in larger sizes, have a lower entry price point, which is particularly useful in developing and emerging markets. And so you have an intersection of a very important business imperative on affordability and the fact that ultimately, a refillable package is less likely to go to waste and has a lower carbon footprint. And so it really complements our world without waste ESG strategy where we're looking to create a circular economy around our packaging material. So the 2 intersect and give us 2 imperatives at both point in the same direction. And so we're very much looking to invest behind refillable packaging, making progress in gaining in mix in Latin America, also been driving that in parts of Africa. We've even taken to experimenting with returnable glass in the Southwest of the U.S. And so we are very focused on this because it does work for both of these imperatives, and so expect to see kind of more focus and more investment behind keeping that up and working with retailers to make it simple for the consumers to get the credits when they return these reusable bottles. So very much an investment focus.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira : James, just to conclude on pricing, you mentioned that you continue to monitor further inflation pressures and also alluded to potentially further pricing. Are you seeing -- I'm assuming you're seeing better-than-anticipated price elasticity. Do you see room for additional pricing perhaps in developed markets and in particular in certain clusters in the U.S.? And if not, any flexibility to protect the bottom line with SG&A efficiencies that you can highlight at this point?\nJames Quincey: Well, clearly, I mean, I've talked about our approach to pricing several times. And that is going to lead to more -- I mean there are going to be more price increases depending on where you are in. I mean there are countries with inflation well into double digits. And you do see multiple price increases during the year, as a matter, of course, when you're in those sorts of circumstances, with cost pressures to push through as you seek to sustain margins over time. Let me just address the elasticity question. It has been apparent, and other people have commented on less elasticity in recent times as price increases have gone through. I do not expect elasticities to be inelastic going forward. There's a reason you got the name elasticity. And so I fully expect, as I commented earlier on, inflation generally ends with some pressure somewhere. I expect elasticity to increase at some point in the future. Will that be next quarter? Or will that be next year? I can't give you the answer to that because it's very dependent on some macros, and it's probably going to vary by country. But we are very attuned to it, which is why I talked about how we are leaning into investing behind our brands so that we earn the right for the price increases, so that we can minimize the elasticity and that we keep a sharp eye on affordability, which again tends to minimize elasticity if we use RGM well. But as I say, if the choice comes down to, we think the elasticity is going up or we're going to have to not pass through some cost, we're going to err towards taking the price increase rather than not taking the price increase. As I said earlier, not seeing the cost go through and arriving at a recession being behind the curve is less desirable than embarking and having to take the hit from a greater elasticity in the short term. And so that's our kind of modus operandi, and we will certainly seek to earn the right to take the price increases. We certainly aren't looking to take price increases just because we can. We want to earn them as a brand, and we want to make sure we recover the cost over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore.\nRob Ottenstein : James, in the opening comments, you mentioned that you had digitally connected, I believe, with 2 million customers in Latin America. Can you elaborate on what that allows you to do? What that means, the upside there? What you're seeing in the market from that and how you expect to or how you plan to roll that out globally?\nJames Quincey: Yes. Thanks, Robert. This is a very important area for us and our bottling partners. Simply put, the idea of connecting these customers is essentially that our retailers, particularly the traditional trade and the fragmented trade, remembering that on a global basis, about half of our sales go to the fragmented trade, whether that's from grocery side or fragmented in terms of being away-from-home and [eatery], so about half of the global sales go to that, is being able -- that they can order the Cokes they need or the rest of the portfolio that they need, they don't have to necessarily wait for the salesperson to turn up. This isn't about replacing the salesperson, very far from it. This is about enabling the selling system to be even more effective in that being able to connect with the retailers, generate orders. And so very much it's about sales force enablement system, such that in the same way that consumers in the developed world can just use their phones to -- with whatever system, with whatever app is appropriate to order things, and they don't have to go to the store to get them.  We see that the bottling system will be able to sell more and very much in the -- where we've implemented these systems, where it's a complement to the sales force, it has driven extra sales and driven retailer loyalty. And so we think we can see -- and obviously, we're very much engaged with the bottling partners to drive the connectivity, particularly for the fragmented trade so that they could order whatever they want, whenever they want from the Coke portfolio. And that's as true in the rollout, as you called out in Latin America. Myccep.com is the same basic idea. It's all about technologically enabling the selling system to be more effective for the retailers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Laurent Grandet from Guggenheim.\nLaurent Grandet: I'd like to come back to the progress of Costa Cafe. I mean, it was mentioned in your prepared remark, I mean Coffee was up 27%. But some of it was -- of that growth was coming from cycling in the Costa store closures. Could you expand maybe more on the non-store business progress? Hot and cold, where are you expanding the brand, which countries? And what are you seeing in terms of consumer reaction?\nJames Quincey: Yes. Laurent, looking at the non-retail business of Costa, the Express machines, the kind of vending digital barista machine had a very strong quarter with transactions growing strongly, and we're starting -- and we're seeing -- now that reopenings have occurred, we're starting to see the focus on placement of new machines across Europe and the Middle East; and also in China, although that's got a little harder in the last couple of months. But the Express machine is still doing very well. Obviously, they need the opening of the world to happen. And then on the Proud to Serve front, which is kind of providing the beans and machines to independent outlets, starting to ramp that up more in the Europe.  Europe environment, again, early days. We did launch some tests in at-home. That's too early to kind of call. And then Costa ready-to-drink has done pretty well in China. It's sustained its #2 position. It's continuing to grow, and we've launched it also in some of the European markets. So starting to see those innovations roll out, and we'll see how they do in the coming quarters.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: James, I wanted to pivot to your business in China, given the uptick in COVID cases there and related lockdown measures. Perhaps you could just comment on one, what you're seeing from a demand perspective; two, perhaps the exit rate for March and what you're seeing in April; and then three, maybe just more broadly, the company's ability to better execute in your view, despite lower levels of consumer mobility now over 2 years into the pandemic?\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. I mean, clearly, China is an important market to us. As I said in the script, we had a strong start to the year going into Chinese New Year. But the lockdowns, particularly Shanghai, took the steam out of things, and we ended the quarter negative. It's -- the key factor will be the degree of mobility. And we had -- and depending on how big that is will make a huge difference to the level of results. I don't think there's anything to call from the early days of April that's different to what was happening at the back end of March. The lockdowns, as you can read in the newspapers, are still in full force, so to speak, in those cities where they're locking down. And I think that's going to remain the biggest factor. Of course, we're going to focus on what we can control. We certainly had 2 years of trying to look at what that looked like over the last couple of years, and we'll continue to build on those learnings and the playbook that we had and adapt as necessary. It's a little difficult to predict exactly what it's going to look like, but we feel -- said a different way, we feel better prepared and more resilient for the COVID journey of 2022 in China than we did in 2020.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities..\nChris Carey : So actually, following up a bit on the prior question, but more globally. John said in the prepared remarks, there was improvement away-from-home channel in most markets, but not all. I appreciate Asia Pacific will have specific impacts in the quarter, as just noted. But I wonder if you could just give us a sense of the progression of the away-from-home channel recovery globally, perhaps relative to 2019? And if you have any context on total company or key region, that would be helpful. Really underlying the question here is just a sense of the current state of the channel as we all contemplate prospects of slowing global growth and how the company will manage through any reversal back of the away-from-home with levers at its disposal.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean, firstly on -- firstly, let me step back both. The away-from-home channels, whilst we have recovered to our 2019 levels, the away-from-home channels have not yet fully recovered. And in part, the -- and we -- I think I've talked about this on previous call, we've lost outlets in the course of the pandemic. That's true of the away-from-home, and that's also true of the fragmented grocery trades. And so there has been an impact on the number of outlets. It's not fully back. Of course, there is a distinction by sub-channel with away-from-home, particularly QSR has done well, particularly those with digital and drive-through have done well. So the away-from-home channel, even in a country, can't be considered as a thing. You need to break it down into the different subcategories and really look at it by that. But again, globally, it's not quite back at the 2019. There are big distinctions depending on what sort of sub-channel we're looking at. In terms of the current global status, yes, China very much impacted by COVID lockdowns, but there are other parts of Asia Pacific, Southeast Asia where there were pressures on the away-from-home channel. I mean, let me include Japan, which only just lifted the state of emergency, and we should start to see that improve. So as you think about the rest of the year, there are places where there is recovery yet to come. And of course, if there are recessionary impacts, either because of recession or loss of purchasing power in the face of inflation in certain parts of the world, then that will be an offsetting factor as we go into it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge Research.\nBrett Cooper : Can you address your thoughts on adding non-owned products to your or your systems offerings to win in digitization of your customer relationships? And then maybe in alcohol specifically to help scale the system in what is a new area for the company on an aligned basis across markets?\nJames Quincey: I mean, we have a whole series of different situations around the world. I think the starting point is there's not one universal answer to this question. And part of that is because the nature of the retail landscape, the nature of the distribution systems and the nature of the alcohol regulation is different in different parts of the world. We certainly start from the principle that our primary interest is in the brands of The Coca-Cola Company. To the extent -- and you've heard me talk about like never say never in a kind of a probalistic view of things, to the extent that a case can be made for other products being on the trucks, probably other beverage products, including alcohol, and that is somehow going to make the system, the bottlers and it's going to sell more of our brands, then that is a question we're going to look at. And there are certainly parts of the world. We're going down that road, has been successful in selling more Coke products. Chile would be an example of that where there are other beverage brands, are typically alcoholic ones, whether that be beer or spirits on the truck and in the selling system, which has allowed us to have more salespeople with a digital overlay as we talked about on the previous question, so retailers can order things. But ultimately, it's successful not because we can get more things on the truck, it's successful because we can sell more of the Coke brands. And that was demonstrably true in Chile. Other parts of the world and not necessarily the same initial starting point, and it might make more sense. But the question will always come back to -- I'm always open to hear any ideas that are going to drive more business results and better business results. And my starting point for more and better business results is selling more Cokes and Coke products.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities.\nStephen Lengel: This is Stephen Lengel on for Bill Chappell. Can you help us understand the ultimate goal of the [Coke] marketing campaign comparing regular Coke to Coke Zero? Is there a potential expectation that Coke Zero may be bigger than regular Coke in North America within the next 5 years?\nJames Quincey: That's a simple one. No. I'm not sure there's anywhere in the world that Coke Zero is bigger than Coke. There are certainly some countries in the world where the combination of Diet Coke and Coke Zero sell approximately the same as Coke Classic. In the end, Coke is a great franchise. We make available the classic version, the Coke Zero Sugar version, and we invite consumers to drink the one that best suits them. We are not trying to predetermine the mix structure. We are trying to offer the alternatives to get to invite the consumers into the franchise. But no, specifically, I don't expect Coke Zero to overtake Coke Classic in North America in the short term.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.\nJames Quincey: Thank you, operator. Well, just to summarize, obviously, we're very pleased with our first quarter results. And while there are clearly more clouds on the horizon, our strategy is intact, and we are well equipped to execute and invest for sustained growth. Thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."}], "2024": [{"symbol": "KO", "quarter": 4, "year": 2023, "date": "2024-02-13 12:29:09", "content": "Operator: At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Coca-Cola Company's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. All participants will be on listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations Department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Ms. Robin Halpern, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Halpern, you may now begin.\nRobin Halpern: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We've posted schedules under financial information in the Investors section of our company website. These reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to this morning to results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our growth and operating margin. This call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC reports. Following prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question. Re-enter the queue to ask any follow-up. Now, I will turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Robin. And good morning, everyone. In 2023, we achieved our near-term goals, while also positioning our business for the long-term. Our all-weather strategy delivered 8% comparable earnings per share growth despite greater than expected 7% currency headwinds. Today, we are leveraging our scale globally and winning locally, which gives us confidence that we can deliver on our 2024 guidance. This morning, I'll talk about the global consumer landscape, then I'll highlight how our strategy and enhanced capabilities are making us a more agile and effective organization. And finally, John will discuss our financial results and our 2024 guidance. During the quarter, we benefited from strong performance across many of our markets. However, some were impacted by elevated inflation and others by geopolitical tensions and conflict. We delivered 12% organic revenue growth, which included 2 points of volume growth, continuing a positive volume trend for the year. Throughout, we continue to invest in our business to provide the right portfolio of brands and packages to retain and attract more drinkers. We drove industry growth and delivered value share gains in the quarter and for the full year. We achieved these results by effectively navigating a number of headwinds and capitalizing on tailwinds across our markets. During the quarter, we saw strong consumer demand across Australia, India, Latin America, Japan and South Korea. In North America, consumer spending in aggregate is holding up well. And in Europe, consumers remain cost conscious. In Africa and China, the macro environment remains uncertain. And in the Middle East, tensions have resulted in some shapes in consumer behavior that have had an impact on our business. Another important fact that I highlight is the inflationary pressures, which are moderating or stabilizing across most of our markets. To keep consumers in our franchise, we are leveraging our revenue growth management capabilities to tailor our offerings and price pack architecture to meet consumers' evolving needs. In North America and Europe, while inflation is moderating, the cumulative impact of inflation is pressuring certain consumer segments we're seeking value. Throughout 2023, we increased our affordability offerings and one volume and value share in both regions. In Latin America, despite double digit inflation during the fourth quarter, we grew volume 4% and increased household penetration and basket initiatives. There are a few pockets of the world that are experiencing hyperinflation. John will later speak to how this dynamic is impacting our business. However, I did want to mention that our local franchise operating model allows us to navigate through hyperinflationary environment and then gain an advantage over the long-term. Across our business, we continue to prioritize agility and focus on improving every aspect of how we operate. An important part of this is our marketing transformation. To recruit the next generation of drinkers, our marketing has shifted from a TV centric model to a digital first organization that balances local intimacy, scale and flexibility. Our digital mix has gone from less than 30% in 2019 to approximately 60% of our total media spend. In 2023, we stood up Studio X, the digital ecosystem that brings this altogether. We created physical hubs in each of our operating units to integrate disciplines, standardized data and technology and step change our capabilities. Creative, media, social and production capabilities and now operating at scale connected by our global network structure. In our previous model, it took several months to create a TV ad. Now, we're producing thousands of pieces of digital content that are contextually relevant and measuring these results in real-time. Studio X is driving tangible results. For example, Coke Studio which originated in Pakistan and taps into consumers' passion for music has been scale to our top 40 markets. The campaign uses packaging as digital portals to access real magic experiences, which have generated more than 1.2 billion YouTube views and a 100 million music streams this year, resulting in strong recruitment of Gen Z drinkers. We're engaging differently with consumers and is delivering results. In 2023, according to Cantor, Coca-Cola brand value increased $8 billion. Coke is now the 10th most valuable brand in the world, up seven spots from the prior year. In the US, Sprite was named by Morning Consult as the number one beverage brands for Gen Z drinkers. We were also named one of the top 10 innovative companies in augmented and virtual reality by Fast Company. Our innovation agenda is increasing our competitive advantage across our products, packaging and equipment. Taste is the starting point. Simply put, people want drinks to taste great. To drive superiority across our total beverage portfolio, we're continuing to build capabilities to tap into unique insights in taste and aroma sciences. We're applying digital tools, ingredient processing technology and AI to create bolder and more successful innovations. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar is an ongoing example of how superior taste drives demand, with volume that grew 5% in 2023, leading to continued volume and value share gains. We are applying learnings from this multiyear success and driving taste superiority elsewhere in our sparkling portfolio. In 2023, we launched Sprite and Fanta reformulations in 25 markets, delivering mid-single digit volume growth in those markets and driving overall sparkling flavors value share gains. Outside of our sparkling portfolio, we're dialing up flavor profiles, adding functional benefits and expanding into new categories. In Japan, we relaunched Georgia Coffee, which generated broader customer interest and led to value share gains. In the US, fairlife\u2019s Core Power and nutrition plan of a high protein dairy without compromising taste. In 2023, fairlife grew volume 15%, its 9th consecutive year of double digit volume growth. We're also seeing continued promising results from FUZE Tea across Europe, Jack and Coke in the Philippines, Flashlight in Mexico, among many others. In 2023, innovation contributed to approximately 30% of gross profit growth and our success rates have nearly tripled compared to 2019 levels. Our revenue growth management execution capabilities continue to be distinct advantages. As demonstrated by our ability to deliver volume and transaction growth, despite ongoing inflationary pressures. We're working with our bottling partners to capture every opportunity available to create significant value for consumers and customers. By offering a total beverage portfolio in the right packages and at the right price points, we're driving category expansion and becoming more relevant to more consumers and customers. In North America, we're evolving packaging options across more distribution points, drive affordability and premiumization. On the affordability side, our 1.25 liter PET bottles are now available in 80% of supermarkets and our 16 ounce can distribution increased by 14 points in convenience stores during 2023. We're also focused on premiumization through the expansion of our mini can offerings. During the quarter, we launched 15 pack mini cans in grocery and club channels. In Europe, we're leveraging the same playbook, but adapting it to local needs. In Spain, our 1.25 liter PET package is offered at a compelling price point and it drove 16% volume growth and increased household penetration in 2023. In Italy, Britain and Ireland, we drove premium single serve mini cans, a smaller package offerings to generate positive mix and incremental retail sales. Our franchise system uniquely combines the benefits of scale and knowledge sharing with the know-how needed to execute for customers and win locally in many different operating environments. For example, approximately 70% of purchase decisions are influenced at point of sale, our systems stepped up in-store displays during the quarter which drove incremental retail sales and cross selling opportunities. Putting it all together, we created $15 billion in incremental retail sales for our customers in 2023, more than any other beverage company. This was our sixth year in a row as the leader in value creation. While we're pleased with our progress, we recognize there's still much work to be done to capture the vast opportunities available. Our system is galvanized to move further and faster. Before I hand over to John, I want to acknowledge that none of this could happen without the unwavering dedication of our employees. And so as we turn to 2024, we expect the year will bring new challenges and opportunities. And we'll remain ready to respond through continuing to improve execution of our strategy across our total beverage portfolio. I look forward to sharing more next Tuesday at CAGNY and I encourage everyone to listen in. With that, I will turn the call over to John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James. And good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter and throughout 2023, we delivered strong results. During the quarter, we grew organic revenues 12% which was in-line with our full year organic revenue growth. Unit case growth was 2% and it was positive in each quarter of 2023. Concentrate sales grew 1 point ahead of unit cases, driven primarily by one additional day in the quarter. Our price mix growth of 9% in the quarter was driven by three factors. One, 2023 pricing actions across most of our markets. Two, hyperinflationary pricing that I'll speak to in just a moment. And three, some mix which is mostly timing related. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 140 basis points. Driven by underlying expansion and a slight benefit from bottle refranchising. Partially offset by the impact of currency headwinds. Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 40 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by strong topline growth, partially offset by currency headwinds and an increase in marketing investments. The positive volume and topline growth that we're realizing today demonstrates the effectiveness of our marketing spend. Below the line, comparable other income declined primarily due to the operating environment in Argentina. Putting it all together, fourth quarter comparable EPS of $0.49 was up 10% year-over-year, despite higher than expected 13% currency headwinds. Before moving on, I wanted to discuss the impact of a few hyperinflationary markets on our fourth quarter results. During the quarter, inflation intensified and exceeded 60% across these markets. In aggregate, while they represent less than 5% of our total volume, this degree of inflation creates a cosmetic distortion to our underlying results. In the fourth quarter, these markets contributed more than 3 points of our price mix and most of our currency headwinds, including an outsized impact to comparable other income from balance sheet remeasurement in Argentina. They did not, however, have a material impact on our earnings per share results. In hyperinflationary markets it's either impractical or impossible to hedge our currency exposure. And to manage it, we use our full suite of revenue growth management tools, including pricing actions to keep pace with local market inflation. We have been operating a long-time in these markets and we expect to be in them for a long-time to come. We work hand-in-hand with our local bottling partners and our focus will be to continue to nurture the strong relationships we have with our consumers and customers. And to ultimately prevail longer-term. So while we will continue to experience volatility of this nature in a few markets, it's important to keep in mind they are operated locally, they are typically self-funding and they have not impeded our overall ability to grow earnings per share. As we move forward, we are confident that our business model and the many levers within it will allow us to deliver on our overall objectives. In 2023 free cash flow was $9.7 billion, which increased from the prior year. 2023 free cash flow included a transition tax payment of approximately $720 million, which was approximately $340 million higher than the prior year and included approximately $230 million in M&A related payments. Our underlying free cash flow growth was largely attributable to strong operational performance and working capital benefits. If you exclude the full impact of the transition tax in M&A related payments, our adjusted free cash flow conversion ratio would be within our target range of 90% to 95%. Our balance sheet remains strong. And our net debt leverage of 1.7 times EBITDA is below our targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times. During the fourth quarter, in addition to offsetting dilution from the exercise of stock options by employees, we repurchased additional shares in anticipation of expected proceeds from bottler refranchising. As James mentioned, we anticipate 2024 will bring new challenges and opportunities. However, through our all-weather strategy, we've proven we can deliver in many different operating environments. Our 2024 guidance builds on the underlying momentum of our business. We expect organic revenue growth of 6% to 7% and comparable currency neutral earnings per share growth of 8% to 10%. We anticipate hyperinflationary pricing will continue to play a role in 2024, but it will moderate throughout the year. We continue to make significant progress towards refranchising company owned bottling operations. Bottler refranchising is expected to be a 4 point to 5 point headwind to comparable net revenues and a 2 point headwind to comparable earnings per share. But will have a positive impact on both our margins and the return profile of our business. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate 2 point to 3 point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 4 point to 5 point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2024. Notably, much of our anticipated 2024 currency headwinds are attributed to hyperinflationary markets with a meaningful impact in the fourth quarter. Our underlying effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be 19.2%. All in, we expect comparable earnings per share growth of 4% to 5% versus $2.69 in 2023. We expect to generate approximately $9.2 billion of free cash flow in 2024 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $2.2 billion in capital investments. The $11.4 billion of cash from operations includes two items to highlight, transition tax payments of approximately $960 million, an increase of approximately $240 million versus 2023, payments associated with various M&A transactions of approximately $560 million, an increase of approximately $330 million versus 2023. Driven by our underlying cash flow generation and current balance sheet strength, we have ample flexibility to both reinvest in our business to drive growth and return capital to our shareowners. A significant portion of our expected capital investment increase is to build capacity for fairlife and for our India business, both of which experienced robust growth in 2023. Related to capital return, we have an unwavering priority to grow our dividend as we've done with 61 consecutive years of dividend increases. With respect to share repurchases, we will be flexible in our approach. Typically, we've repurchased shares to offset any dilution from the exercise of stock options by employees in the given year. Our capital allocation policy prioritize agility. And we're committed to taking the right actions needed to drive the long-term health of our business and create value for our stakeholders. There are some considerations to keep in mind for 2024. The first quarter of 2024 will be impacted by the timing of concentrate shipments in the fourth quarter of 2023 in some markets and cycling our strongest volume growth quarter from the prior year. We estimate the ongoing conflict in the Middle East had approximately 1 point of impact on volume growth during the fourth quarter of 2023. It's unclear how long this impact will last. In November 2023, the U.S. Tax Court rendered its supplemental opinion related to our ongoing dispute with the Internal Revenue Service. We intend to move forward on appeal and vigorously defend our position. We have ample balance sheet flexibility to fund any payment related to the appeal. Finally, due to our reporting calendar, there will be one less day in the first quarter and two additional days in the fourth quarter. So in summary, we're pleased with what we accomplished in 2023, we're building on our capabilities to continue the underlying momentum across our markets, we're progressing on our refranchising agenda and we're reinvesting in our system to drive long-term growth. We have great confidence, we can deliver on our 2024 guidance and long-term commitments. With that, operator, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have any additional questions, you may rejoin the queue. Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I know John just went through a lot of details on the guide, but I did just want to step back and maybe go to a higher level conversation on this, because for 2023, you ended up with high single digit earnings growth even with that 7 point currency headwind. And the initial guide for 2024 for mid-single digit earnings growth, feels like a reasonable starting point, but can you just contextualize a bit how you're thinking about the impact of hyperinflation like John mentioned in the Middle East tensions that consumer backdrop, et cetera. How you're able to kind of come through with that U.S. dollar based earnings growth outlook for the year? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yeah. Good morning. A couple of things. Firstly, the mid single digit growth in 2024 is after the impact of the refranchising that we pulled out. So in other words, pre-structural change that's really six to seven. Second, what I think 2024 represents is a -- ultimately a continuation of the underlying strength and momentum in the business that's being created. If you look at 2023 or you look all the way back to 2019, take five years if you like, what is captured within that is the kernel of the core business running at the top end of the growth algorithm. Yes, there has been inflation and distractions and up and downs, but in the end, running through that is a continuous amount of volume growth as we focus on our consumer franchise and keeping people in and growing the weekly plus consumers in our franchise, managing the cycle of inflation that is now distinct depending on where you are and well, but managing that cycle of inflation, such that we now have in the majority of the countries, 90% plus of the countries normalized levels of kind of pricing more or less coming out of 2023. And so, what you see in this guidance is really the core business in the 90 plus percent of the countries, really low -- taking that combination of headwinds and tailwinds that we've experienced, there'll be a different setting in 2024 that bound to be some new surprises. But we will manage through them with our all-weather strategy and deliver volume growth, growth in the consumer base with weekly plus, we'll earn our right to take an appropriate level of pricing and deliver at the top end of the growth algorithm. And then there's the overlay of the inflationary markets and the selling of the bottler, the bottling investment groups that we've done. And that hyperinflation upright is, as John said, a few points on the top. And obviously, some on the bottom and largely offset by the devaluation. So those two things go together, but captured within that is a strong core growing top and bottom, in-line with the growth algorithm.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey. Good morning. So maybe just a quick follow-up there. As you think about that 6% to 7% organic sales growth guidance for 2024, can you just give us a bit more detail on volume versus pricing on the underlying business, maybe extra hyperinflationary markets just as we think about that balance between volume and pricing. And then, James just more importantly longer-term, perhaps you could just take a step back and review your confidence in delivering that long-term top line algorithm and the higher end of that algorithm, just as you look out over the next few years, taking a look back at the last few years, there's obviously been a lot of volatility, hard for us to judge from an external perspective given all the volatility with COVID, but how do you think about sort of the success of the strategic initiatives you put in place the last few years, and what level of confidence that gives you in the long-term looking out a few years? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Look, I'm trying to justice the various angles that. Let me unpack a little bit 2023 -- the end of 2023 as a way of coming into 2024. In 2023, we had 2% volume growth, that was true in the fourth quarter and it was true through the year. And actually if you take a five year CAGR, we've been running at 2% volume growth for the last five years. So, to start with the volume, there has been strong underlying volume growth in the last quarter, in the last year, in the last five years. So that's there. And that's true because we focused on building momentum in the system around building the consumer franchise. When you look at how that's come along with pricing, obviously there's the pandemic, the ups and downs and inflation. But let's just break apart 2023 and how that then flows into 2024. If you look at the fourth quarter of 2023, it says 9%, yes, it says 9%. As John pointed out, there a couple of points there that's related to the intra year quarter-to-quarter deduction timing, so take off the two and you get a seven. Of the remaining seven, half of it is normal pricing in the 95% of the business, does not hyperinflationary. And the other 3.5% is in the hyperinflationary countries, because the inflation is so high. So really, what have you've got in the fourth quarter. You've got 2% volume, you've got 3.5%, a bit more than 3.5% price -- price mix and that's the call. There you've got something that's running bang in the center of the long-term growth algorithm of five to six on the topline. It was true in the fourth quarter, it's true as the kernel in the whole 2023, actually it's really true across the whole of the last five years. Once you take out some of these inflationary distortions in the selling of the bottling company. But there it is running the last quarter of last year, the last five years. Think about 2024, we're going to go as we've always said, for a balance of volume and price. In that 95% of the business, we're going to see volume growth and we're going to see normalized pricing growth on -- our aim is for the net of the two to be in that top end of the long-term growth algorithm for revenue growth. Yes, there's going to be an overlay of hyperinflation, that's probably more like a couple of points as we think about 2024 on the topline and that's why you get what we called out in terms of the topline growth. But hopefully that unpack a bit of how price mix has got this hyperinflationary distortion, it actually it's also got the selling of the bottlers, if you don't do it on comparable. But really embedded in that six to seven is a keep hitting the long-term growth [algorithm] (ph) on revenue for the kind of the six year. And we feel the momentum we've built with our bottling partners, investing in the marketing, the innovation, the in-store execution. The execution in the marketplace with the RGM strategies across the global profile of geographies gives us strong confidence we will continue with our momentum.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs . Please go ahead, your line is open.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Good morning. Actually, I had a question on gross margins. I was hoping for a little bit more color on the drivers of your expansion in Q4, which came in better than expected. And then could you highlight maybe the key puts and takes on margins this year. Curious, how much do you expect COGS inflation maybe to moderate or will higher sugar cost continue to be a big headwind? Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Bonnie. Let me start by just pickup from her. James has often step out of both the quarter and the year, if you look over the last four years our -- we've been able to sustain a pretty resilient gross margin line. And as we go into 2024, expect to be able to continue to do so. There's some expansion embedded in the long-term growth model and we're confident that we can continue to drive that. With respect to 2023, the key ingredients, so to speak were the impact of the various pricing actions. We've had around the world, somewhat offset by higher than the normal inflation with some of our commodity items, and some our non-commodity costs. But overall for 2023, that's the key story. In 2024, I think you\u2019ll need to take into account the mechanical impact of the refranchising of those markets that we talked about in the release that will layer in throughout 2024. Keep in mind to the impact of foreign currency headwinds. I think, against that, then we will continue to drive the levers that we have. I've talked about this in the past, but maybe worth just highlighting. We start really with the -- with that suite of revenue growth management tools and the many actions that we can take with that. We have a very resilient supply chain, tremendous partners across the supply chain. We source mostly locally and we continue to drive through our scale a lot of productivity and in almost each line item of what comprises the supply chain. So going into 2024, I think it's worth just reiterating, well we expect to see margin expansion. Some of it driven by that mechanical effect of the bottler refranchising. And with some more normalized costs inflation relative to the last couple of years, plus continuing to deploy those levers. I talked about, we see the opportunity to continue to drive per our long-term growth model expansion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nBryan Spillane: Hey. Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to just drill in a little bit more on North America. And James, I think on the last earnings call, you talked a little bit about channel shift, right like on-premise or foodservice maybe growing faster than some of the take home channels, there were some commentary, I think also about or observations, I should say about maybe low income consumers. So maybe just kind of state of things there. And John, just if you can also clarify, I think in the press release there was a mentioned in the description around price mix, some sort of adjustment, so wasn't sure if that's an accrual related to promotions or just if you could just give us a little bit more color on that as well. And also, it sounds like it's concentrate shipments might have lagged in the quarter, so that we make that up in the first quarter. There's a lot there, but if you guys can just fill in that would be helpful. Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: Yes. Let me take the end. And then I'll pass it over to James for the beginning. The mix that you referred to is timing related and it's not unusual in the fourth quarter to have timing related items, and in the deductions area, particularly, that will flow back through into next year.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Consumer, let me go with two things. One, clearly the consumer landscape in North America, one has to not think of it in aggregate, because actually in aggregate, the U.S. consumer spending power has held up pretty strongly compared to some other developed markets. What has been important is to understand, there is a section of the population that has come under pressure from disposable income, the real spending power squeeze from the inflationary effects and there we are very much focused on affordability. And you could perhaps argue that some of them went out less, there was more at-home purchases. Some of the certain channels and there we really focus with affordability, both from pack size --individual pack size and with multi packs. On the other hand, there a segment of consumers that still have plenty of money, plenty of purchasing power and we've seen strong growth for some of the higher price point premium segments like fairlike core power. Simply, some of those ones, so there's clearly a multiple things going on in the landscape in terms of categories and price points and we've been working to address both ends of those. And as it relates to channels, I think we've seen the kind of re-normalization, there has been a historic slight shift in volume consumption from at-home to away over time. Clearly through COVID, there was a big down in the away from home and then a rebound in 2021 the away from home channels. In 2022 they stay out, but they continue to outpace at-homes. In 2023, they were slightly ahead of at-home. If you look at the various away from home channels, they were slightly ahead of at-home. I would say that landing more in what it was previous to COVID kind of the more normal situation. So that's kind of what I would say strong need to focus on the different consumer segments and the sort of re-normalization of the -- some of the channel dynamics.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nStephen Powers: Great. Thank you. Good morning. Two questions if I could, I know I'm supposed to have one, but one to quick. Just on the -- so if you could clarify, maybe it's for John, you called out the 2% to 3% currency headwind for next year on the revenue, but a 4% to 5% headwind on EPS. Just if you could, how much of that incremental bottom line headwinds is going to show up in operating profit versus below the line, given monetary asset revaluation, et cetera. And then, I guess the broader question is just thinking about all the refranchising activity and the system progress that you've made in 2023, we talked about the financial impacts of that in 2024, but I guess I'd love your perspective, James, on the importance of the steps you made in 2023 in terms of just betterment of the system overall and priorities going forward from a system evolution perspective. Thank you.\nJohn Murphy: Okay. Shall I start at this time? And then you go second, John.\nJohn Murphy: Sure.\nJames Quincey: Look, we have been focused on our refranchising effort. And as I like John's raised, our ambition is to be the world's smallest bottler. It still remains absolutely true, but we're going to do it at the pace. We sort of make sure we do the refranchising in the right way with the right partners. I think we can categorically say we're very pleased with the refranchising process that we have undertaken over the last number of years. Almost without exception, every time we've poured one of the bottling companies into the hands of the right partner with the joint vision and investment plan to take the business forward. We have stepped up performance, whether it be a straight refranchising or a combination, creating new bottlers or evolve bottlers, we have up to a level of performance. And I think that is a sign of the commitment of the company to invest in what it does best, which is the branding, the marketing, the innovation, working with our bottlers to get the revenue growth management and their unwavering commitment to drive execution and build capabilities and capacities in the marketplace. And that does help, Power, the overall performance I talked about in the answer to the previous questions. So, as -- I think we're in the penultimate chapter of the refranchising. There's only really a couple of pieces left at the right time with the right partners, we would like to finish the play. But really, we have our eye on the prize on creating a much stronger system together with our bottling partners to continue the top of the algorithm momentum very far into the future.\nJohn Murphy: Great. And on currency, Steve. Let me just make a couple of comments in case there are other questions out there on currency overall. First of all, I think it's important to highlight the 2024 guidance that we've given. It would be close to flat if we were to exclude those few hyperinflationary markets. And it just reinforces the point that we're making on that sort of distortion that those few markets have. And then secondly, with regards to your specific question, I do not have that breakdown. Today, there is just too many -- there's just too many puts and takes, particularly in that below the operating income line as we go through the year. You got to do a monthly remeasurement on the balance sheet items. And that's just a calculation, that's -- I don't have the ability to predict with great detail. So I just keep in mind that the overall impact I think is the one to focus on. In normal years the multiplier is 1.5 times to 2 times, we would continue to assume that will be the case going forward. But these hyperinflationary markets have a tenancy to create that distortion that we've highlighted and we\u2019ll continue to provide guidance as we go through the year to make sure that everybody stays abreast of the latest developments.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. So, James, I think you made a very strong case that really over the last five years, if you accept the noise you've delivered at roughly kind of 5.5%, topline growth, which puts you clearly in the top rankings of your other staples companies. And that's great. In terms of both 2024 and looking forward, assuming a continuation of that, what can you do to both derisk that in terms of the bottom line and enhance it in terms of the bottom line given various macro variables. And then given that you've now de-levered to 1.7%, you've shown interest in buying back stock. Should we think of share buybacks as perhaps a greater part of the overall algorithm and value creation for shareholders going forward. Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Okay. So, I mean I think the derisking, I think what I would say is, look, we face an extraordinary number of headwinds in the last five years and still delivered at the top end of the algorithm. Things will happen in the coming years. But there'll be tailwinds and I think really the argument about the all-weather is, I cannot tell you what the future holds. But if you look at what we've managed to work through and deliver at the top end on the revenue. And the momentum and the capabilities that we've built in the system. And actually if you look at the share and look at our long-term performance, we are also gaining share within the industry, I think you can see a head of steam builds upon momentum and at the scale that we operate, it's a very compelling way to drive it forward. And as that feeds down into the bottom line, obviously, the mid-single digits, the U.S. dollar EPS goal for 2024 includes the disposal of 2 points of EPS from the bottling system. So kind of on an ongoing basis, that's already six to seven. I think we can continue to drive some leverage from the topline to the bottom line in dollars, and that becomes a compelling compound over time. And as it relates to cash, I think that you will see -- we've put in a kind of a new non-GAAP metric, somewhere in the ecosystem of the website, which just calls out what John was talking about, about the number of discrete items that are coming up over the next couple of years. As it relates to transition tax actually curiously tax on the M&A transactions, if you sell a bottler, the money you get disappears into one account, for the taxes you pay goes into the free cash flow curiously enough. So there's a whole set of discrete items that make the free cash flow look odd for the next few years. But if you strip that out, you see that the earnings are flowing into free cash flow. The cash conversion on that adjusted basis remains very high and is likely to do so. So on a -- in a normal world, clearly, as John said, we will continue to increase our dividend and we would have substantive additional cash to continue to invest in the business and consider potential share repurchases. The wrinkle in the cream, if you like, is our considerations of the IRS tax case and the impending appeal. And so, as we go forward for the next few years, we like our strong balance sheet, we are mindful of the likelihood of launching the appeal in the second half. We have incoming non-operating cash flows, which as John talked about, we used to buy some shares in the fourth quarter. We're going to balance all these things, particularly in the next couple of years, we'll keep everyone updated. But I think the long-term perspective is that, the cash generation will continue to be very strong. John, yes, go on.\nJohn Murphy: Just one additional point. In addition to that, unwavering commitment we have to the dividend that we talked about in the script. One of the lessons I think over the last couple of years is to be prepared to be more dynamic relative to your kind of normal view of the individual components. So, as you know, our debt -- our debt goal is to be 2 times to 2.5 times, and we're up 1.7 times. We think that's right for what we need going into 2024, 2025. We've taken up our CapEx for 2024 because it's the right thing to do to continue to build the growth foundations that we need. And in those parts of the business that need capacity. Just two examples. And so, I think we will continue to demonstrate that as we go forward, the share repurchases in the back half of the year, again was not something that we had necessarily considered at the start of the year. But we first, there was an opportunity with the buffer proceeds coming in to do so. And we continue to take that approach as we enter this coming year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning. I wanted to see if you could maybe frame the global away from home channel. I know you touched on it a little bit in response to Brian's question. But we've heard about, obviously there's a lot of pricing power in that channel, there's been a lot of pricing, you're talking about a normalization from elevated levels back to a more normal channel distribution between at-home and away from home. But can you maybe just give us a bit more granular perspective on what you're seeing by region and whether some of the strengths that I think was occurring in Q4 has continued into this year. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Sure, Chris. I'll give it a go. Look, I think that the headline is the commentary about North America to some extent applies -- to some extent applies everywhere else in the sense that clearly in COVID there was the close downs, the reopening, big swings between away from home and at-home. But in 2022, it kind of re normalized. And I think overall in 2023, you see that again, you saw that in the U.S. where the away from home channels in aggregate was slightly ahead of the at-home channels. You see that also in Europe or the EMEA segment, you see the at-home slightly high, but it's only marginal. And when you break it down, I mean there's going to be the kind of continuing structural growth of away from home. But it's only a small fraction. If that's a sort of leading to a question about pricing. And is there some ongoing likelihood of big upside from kind of channel mix, the short answer is, no. If I were to take a proxy of immediate consumption packages in future comps and consumption packages, because channel mix becomes very different as you get to different parts of the world, particularly the emerging markets. Then they became much more -- the kind of the immediate consumption came much more into balance versus the future consumption in 2023 relative to 2022. And that's not too surprising as we stopped also [indiscernible] affordability having been a strategy in 2023. So that's a roundabout way of saying, we're not expecting big mix effects from channel in 2024.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. And good morning, everyone. So James, can you comment a little bit about the U.S., I understand obviously U.S. is not -- in terms of the volumes, it's about 20%, but within our -- your outlook for 2024, you quoted in the fourth quarter that water sports coffee were more negative or decelerating. And how about -- what is of that is like mostly self-inflicted vis-a-vis what you're actually facing in terms of market share and how much you expect that to be lingering into the first half of 2024? And just a clarification to your comment now in terms of like to shifting to on-premise in back to your comments on price mix. Out of the 9% that you got, if my math is correct, you've got about 2% or 3% benefit from mix in 2023. Should we expect that to decelerate or with your efforts to do more mini cans and take that more broadly? Is that still going to be the projected contribution for 2024? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Okay. The comments on the 2% in the fourth quarter, that was related not to channel mix. But to the right -- the way that deductions happens, so this is not -- this is often just an accounting treatment between the quarters within the year. So it's not mix as you would think about it in terms of package mix or channel mix of category mix. This is related to kind of the big difference between gross and net revenue. And so, I -- it's a distraction in the short-term. So I would move past backlog. And if you like -- to me, ignore that bit, focus instead on the underlying impact in 2023 of the non-hyperinflationary pricing, which was the kind of 3.5% which is very -- which ran through 2023 and is inherent in what we are saying roughly speaking for 2024. So we're expecting, right and mix whether these channel category geography package, the sort of things we were saying, which in 2023 is what we're expecting in 2024. And again, those are all largely normalized in 2023, so by influence, they're all largely normalized in 2024 as well. So you kind of see a stability across channels packages, et cetera, et cetera. As it relates more specifically to the U.S., yes, we did some de-prioritization of some of the bulk water categories. And some of the advanced hydration was the normalization or re-stabilization of the sports drinks category. I mean, I don't think there's a -- an obvious or useful split between self-inflicted or proactive decisions versus things that were competitive, that's hard to tease apart. Clearly from a performance point of view, when we think about it in the U.S., yes, there's a fractional softening of the volume through the year, which I think goes back to the comment I made about the different consumer segments. But if you step back and think about what was the overall impact of our marketing innovation RGM and execution with the bottlers, the answer is, we want volume share in 2023, and we want value share in 2023. So yes, there's work to be done in the water category and advance hydration then to a much lesser extent in tea. But the overall picture is strong growth in sparkling particularly, Coke and Sprite, good on smart water, good on vitamin water, good on Topo Chico. Very good on fairlife. Good overall win on both dimensions. And that's the platform we'll be looking to drive in 2024.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nBill Chappell: Yes. Good morning.\nJames Quincey: Hey, Bill.\nBill Chappell: Just a question on kind of the Chinese -- China consumer and both kind of how it's progressed or how he or she has progressed over the past few months versus your expectations or just in general and kind of what you see kind of spending power and just getting back to normal consumption as we move into 2024.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Let me put it out. 2023 started very strongly in China, we had invested very heavily behind Chinese New Year. And we had a very -- actually we had a very strong first quarter last year in China. And then, which is kind of still the back end of the re-openings, and while we grew volumes for the restaurant for the total of the year 2023 and revenues, it did soften for the last three quarters of the year in China. And I think what we're going to see is a kind of a reverse of that in 2024. We've invested strongly again in Chinese New Year. This year, we won't know the result for another few weeks net-net. But we're kind of expecting it to be a little slower in the first quarter, especially given what we are cycling from last year. And then for the year to improve, but not too hot or not too cold, if I can use that analogy. So yes, there's a little weakness in the economic system. But we expect things to get -- we get [tends] (ph) directionally to get better through the year and we're going to keep investing behind not just keep key moments in the year like Chinese New Year but restoring more momentum to sparkling and really focusing on RGM and execution opportunities.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hey, everybody. Good morning. When we met in December, we talked a little bit about 2023, there is a bunch of testing and learning on innovation and 2024 will be about scaling some of them. Both of you mentioned fairlife core power, it's a big brand now. Can you maybe just talk about the scaling of that capacity expansion. And then maybe what other brands we should be considering in that same context? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Sure. I mean, firstly, we're going to continue to experiment and find lots of new things hopefully in 2024, but it's certainly true as say that fairlife has been on a roll. And we have been driving that. I think you should have noted a double digit volume growth for as many years I can remember plus faster double digits in revenue. Clearly, as we scale that we needed to put that more capacity. We have recently announced and begun the process of building a mega plant up in upstate New York. And so, capacity tight in the fairlife business and core power is also firing on all cylinders. We'll certainly talk about some of these at CAGNY when we'll kind of lay out some of the back story. I think it's like fairlife and particularly core power and how these brands and products have done a great job in driving from experimentation to scaling, the challenging and, for example, in the case of core power to leading.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator. And good morning, everyone. So, James, I was hoping to pick up on your commentary in response to Bryan and Andrea's question on the U.S. Maybe, first, the performance in the quarter play out as you expected, you mentioned softening in the market in your response to Andrea. But was that in-line with how you thought growth would evolve or was it a bit weaker than you would have anticipated? And then looking ahead to 2024, I appreciate the commentary on expecting balanced growth at the total company level, but do you expect that balance to incur in North America as well? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Look, I mean, I think it was at a macro level foreseeable that the market would get tied-up through the course of 2023 as inflation run ahead of wage growth. And so, therefore, yes, it wasn't surprising that would tightness, particularly for certain -- for certain consumer segments. I think all things in due proportion. I mean, the growth in North America in the fourth quarter was basically the same as the growth in the full year, it's only very fractional differences. So, I think these are not big changes in trends. But yes, I think there was a little softening through the -- through 2023. And I think we'll see that kind of a bidding reverse as 2024 starts off as consumers and you can see it in the confidence indicators, the consumers, they're starting to feel like the money coming in is starting to contain and get ahead of the inflation. So I think we'll see that improve through the year, again, all in due proportion, they're not going to be big shifts in the volume growth rate in the U.S. business. In aggregate, we would expect to get more from price relative to volume for the U.S. business. So the balance that I talk about between price and volume applies on a global basis clearly that's been made up of geographic portfolio mix, so places like the U.S., we'd expect to see stable or slightly increasing volume with decent pricing, all the way over to place like India, where clearly we're getting much more volume than price and having to invest significantly in capacity. And those two -- take those two examples, so that's true of the global portfolio, blend it all together and that's where the balance comes from.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Charlie Higgs from Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nCharlie Higgs: Yeah. Hi, James, John, hope you both are well. I got a question on sparkling, please, where I mean, 2% volume growth in the quarter and the year very strong. I think in the 20 quarters since 2019, it's actually averaged 3% in those 20 quarters. So definitely testing our ex-growth. I was just wondering what your perspective is on the category going forward, maybe with the consumer weakening. And if you can just touch on the launch of Coca-Cola space, so [indiscernible] talked about that yet. I mean, what gives you the confidence of launching this as a permanent launch rather than that a limited edition Coke Creations launch and here's the target consumers are going have to Gen Z, is it adds to held for Coke with meals strategy. Just any color on that be useful, please.\nJames Quincey: Yes. I mean, Coke Space, bit like Coke Creations, not exactly, but it is really aimed at increasing connectivity with Gen Z and the broad consumers, driving engagement -- driving reconsideration is part of a whole overall strategy that as you say we've been deploying for a good number of years, that has really worked to reengage consumers with the Coke trademark, whether it's Coke original, Coke Zero Sugar or even Diet Coke to some extent. The overall strategy of an upgraded approach to the marketing, the innovation whether it's Coke's Space or some of the Creations through the RGM in the execution has allowed us to drive our Coke growth across the global business. And actually by also increasing the focus on Fanta and Sprite even organizationally splitting them out into two sub teams within the organization has allowed us to bring more clarity and more focus onto Fanta and to Sprite and to drive growth there, too. Which has worked in Q4 in 2023 and as you say, over the last five years. I know that sometimes people -- well, I would say that people think about the sparkling category just through the optic of the U.S. over the last 20 years. And I would invite you to look at the optics or everyone to look at the optics of the sparkling category globally all the time, and actually there, you see that the category remains robust on a global scale, both in terms of volume and revenue growth. And of course we are not just the leaders, but we are the share winners, so we see -- if we do the right things for our brands, we will be able to drive the category forward and benefit disproportionately from that growth.\nOperator: Our last question today will come from Carlos Laboy from HSBC. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nCarlos Laboy: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Can you comment for us on the state of global independent bottlers CapEx or digital capabilities, we've seen a really robust Latin American digital investment over the last four years or five years, but where else do you see a step up in digital market development capabilities like this. And can you comment on the U.S. in this area as well.\nJames Quincey: On U.S., what?\nCarlos Laboy: On the U.S. regarding digital bottling system investments.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Carlos, yes. I think it's fair to say that the overall investment levels that you referred to in Lat-Am are pretty consistent across the world. Like one of the underlying tailwinds, I believe we have is the degree to which our system is sharing and thus the opportunity that's ahead and willing to increasingly invest ahead of the curve. So I think that's happening across the global system. One of the subsets of that, of course, is the degree to which digital, and its many forms is playing a pivotal role to sustaining and indeed building advantage wherever we operate. We have CAGNY next week. And I think you'll hear more of that threaded through the conversation we'll see up there. But safe to say, I think CapEx levels are at the highest as a percentage of system revenue that I can remember. And within that the appetite and willingness to invest ahead of the curve, particularly in digital is also at a very high level.\nCarlos Laboy: Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Right. Thanks very much, everyone. Just to summarize, we're proud of what we've accomplished in 2023. We are winning in the marketplace, we're going to be maintaining agility and improving every aspect of how we do business across our total beverage portfolio. John and I look forward to discussing more with you all next week at CAGNY. Thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and joining us this morning. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, you may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "KO", "quarter": 3, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-10-24 12:49:06", "content": "Operator: At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to The Coca-Cola Company's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations department if they have any questions. I would now like to introduce Ms. Robin Halpern, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Halpern, you may now begin.\nRobin Halpern: Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We've posted schedules under financial information in the Investors section of our company website at coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our growth and operating margins. In addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC reports. Following prepared remarks, we will turn the call over for questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first and then re-enter the queue. Now, I'll turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Robin and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we delivered strong top line growth, comparable operating margin expansion and earnings per share growth. Our strategy is working. These results continue our track record of consistent delivery. And given our year-to-date performance, we are raising both our top line and bottom line guidance. This morning, I'll provide a brief update on the global consumer landscape. Then I'll focus much of my time on business performance across the segments and discuss how we've been investing to further strengthen our capabilities to capture longer-term growth opportunities. John will end by discussing financial details for the quarter, our revised guidance for full year 2023 and some early considerations for 2024. The global operating environment is always dynamic and this quarter was no exception. Some markets improved sequentially, while others dealt with a variety of factors ranging from transitory weather conditions, ongoing inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions and conflicts. We delivered 11% organic revenue growth this quarter driven by positive volume, some pricing actions in the marketplace and carryover pricing coming into the base from last year. Volume grew 2% and sequentially improved each month in the quarter with September being our strongest month. Our year-to-date volume growth remains consistent with underlying performance compared to 2019. And overall, our industry remains vibrant and is expanding and we are executing to capture that growth. During the quarter, we gained volume and value share in both at-home and away-from-home channels. Consumer sentiment continues to vary around the world. In developed markets, consumer spending in agro goods [ph] has held up quite well, however, some consumers feel pressured. We've seen some shift to discount channels and switching to private label brands in a few markets and categories. The intensity of this activity was largely the same across Europe compared to the previous quarter but was less pronounced in the U.S., Australia and Japan. In the developing and emerging markets, the picture is more mixed. We're seeing broadly consumer strength across Latin America, India and in parts of Central and Southeast Asia. On the other hand, consumer confidence in spending has yet to fully recover in Africa and China. Our revenue growth management execution capabilities give us a distinct advantage and we are leveraging these capabilities to ensure we have the right product in the right package in the right channel and at the right price points to meet consumers where they are. Notwithstanding the dynamics in play around the world, we have many levers to pull and continue to deliver through varying market conditions. I'll share some more details from each region. Starting with Asia Pacific; we delivered organic revenue growth but operating income declined primarily as a result of investing ahead of the curve to participate in longer-term opportunities and incurring additional costs from strategic portfolio rationalization. In ASEAN and South Pacific, we grew top line and profit by linking our brands to drinking occasions coupled with strong execution. In Thailand, we launched Coke Kitchen which connected consumers to influencers who shared their favorite recipes with Coca-Cola. We also partnered with food service aggregators to drive combo meals. Campaign attracted nearly 1 million consumers and we significantly increased the attachment rate of our beverages with meals ordered through food service aggregators. In Japan, we're gaining volume and value share year-to-date. We continue to see strong momentum from our Coca-Cola, Georgia Coffee and I LOHAS campaigns and have stepped up execution in vending, e-commerce and community channels. However, in China, volume declined as the sparkling soft drink category is taking longer to recover. Our results were also impacted by some strategic conditions to deprioritize lower profit categories. Our focus is to restore momentum to the sparkling soft drink category and capitalize on revenue growth management and execution opportunities. In India, we delivered double-digit volume and top line growth which resulted in the highest value share gain over the past 3 years. We're winning in the marketplace by generating 2.6 billion transactions at affordable price point and driving availability across rural regions. Across Asia Pacific, as part of our World Without Waste strategy to help drive circular economy for packaging materials, our system launched 100% recycled PET packaging in India, Indonesia and Thailand. Moving on to EMEA; we delivered strong organic revenue and operating income growth. In Africa, macro conditions remain challenging and our business was further impacted by natural disasters in Morocco and Libya. Despite this environment, we drove transaction growth through accelerated refillable PET expansion, digitizing nearly 100,000 outlets and adding 80,000 coolers used to date. In Europe, consumers are still facing pressure and our business was unfavorably impacted by poor weather. Despite these dynamics, we gained value share through strong performances in sparkling soft drinks and tea. We did this by partnering with systems to drive value for key customers and our consumers. We continue to see promising early results for Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola in Europe. We are learning and expanding in alcoholic drinks, including our recent announcement of our Absolut Vodka & Sprite. And last, in Eurasia and Middle East, we recruited consumers through innovative, occasion-based marketing events like Fanta Fest Turkey which focused on snacking occasions with concerts by prominent local artists. They also launched 100% recycled PET package this summer. In North America, we generated strong organic revenue growth and delivered margin expansion by executing across our total beverage portfolio. We continue to see away-from-home channel outperform at-home channels. Within sparkling soft drink, elasticities are holding up well and we continue to drive quality leadership with Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta. For example, our systems stepped up in-store activation on Sprite Lymonade Legacy and with increased displays at point of sale which drove higher household penetration and repeat purchases. Fanta drove nearly 2 points of vale share gain year-to-date through innovation and new graphics, including the latest Halloween iteration of the What the Fanta platform. Outside sparkling, BODYARMOR and Powerade trends are stabilizing. And fairlife, Core Power, smartwater and Gold Peak generated value share gains. And in the U.S., to protect water resources, we renewed a decade-long partnership with the Department of Agriculture to restore and improve water sheds in national forests and grasslands. Water is a critical priority for our system and the communities that we serve. In Latin America, we generated double-digit top line and profit growth by executing on all facets of our strategy which resulted in value share gains in 4 of our top 5 markets. In the fifth market, Mexico, we're seeing improving value share trends over the last few months. We're increasingly linking our brands to consumers' passion points to build deeper connections. In Brazil, through Coke Studio, we partnered with the Town Music Festival, where we hosted 60 hours of concert and engaged with artists and influencers which generated 1 billion impressions and reached nearly 50 million consumers. We continue to drive affordability through refillable packaging of larger PET packages. In developing and emerging markets, refillables are an important tool to eliminate waste and offer products at lower price points. Last, our systems stepped up availability, reflecting over 270,000 coolers year-to-date which increased our share of visible inventory in key areas. Global ventures generated strong overall growth. At Costa, we strengthened our revenue growth management equation while driving transaction growth. This was supported by strong innovation and marketing campaigns such as our global summer of ice, expansion of the refreshment category and the introduction of our personalized pre-drop loyalty activation in U.K. Additionally, innocent gained value share in both the U.K. and France. Finally, Bottling Investments Group grew organic revenue and operating income through expanding affordable immediate consumption entry packs and progressing for strengthening route to market and optimizing trade collections. At the same time, we're working towards decarbonizing our operations in India through using 200 electric vehicles with plans to add more before the end of 2023. Beyond the quarter, we continue to have confidence in the long term. We see momentum continuing across our industry and our system is galvanized more than ever to capture this opportunity. Leveraging data to drive better decision-making is key to improving execution. Our system has collectively invested in digital initiatives to drive on all facets of our strategy. Starting first with marketing and innovation. Our marketing transformation is increasingly making our brands more relevant to consumers. Today, Gen Zs spend 7 to 9 hours per day on screen. However, very little time is spent watching traditional TV. We've been shifting our media spend towards digital. In 2019, digital was less than 30% of our total media spend and year-to-date is over 60%, through digital campaigns which segment the population that's disproportionately reaching consumers where we earn higher return on investments. We've seen tremendous engagement through digital-first campaigns for Coke with meals, Sprite Heat Happens and Fuze Tea's Made of Fusion among others. We're taking bold steps to be at the forefront of both consumer and non-consumer facing generative AI. For example, we launched Create Real Magic which turns consumers into digital creators. We also brought GenAI into our creative process for the award-winning Coca-Cola Masterpiece film and letting the fans the chance to take a piece of this work through the sale of NFTs. Recently, we launched Coke Y3000 which is our eighth iteration in the Coke Creations platform. Coca-Cola Y3000, the world's first futuristic flavor, co-created with AI. The launch has demonstrated strong initial results. On the non-consumer facing side, we're implementing generative AI to improve access to insight, market data, research and trends. Moving on to revenue growth management and integrated execution. As a system, we're accelerating eB2B platforms that allow for better tailoring of product, price and packaging architecture, reducing out of stocks and optimizing placement of physical inventory. Year-to-date, we've connected 6.9 million customers to eB2B platforms. We continue to expand coverage and offer customers personalization at scale. Initial pilots suggest that customers who receive AI-written push notifications have been more likely to purchase recommended SKUs, resulting in incremental retail sales. And we're just scratching the surface of what's possible but we're investing in digital capabilities now to expand our potential down the road. To sum it all up, we're encouraged by our results year-to-date and this is reflected in our updated 2023 guidance. We have many levers to pull and have proven that we can deliver in many types of markets around the world. We continue to win on a local level, maintain flexibility on a global level and reinvest to build our system for the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll comment on our third quarter performance and highlight our updated 2023 guidance. I'll also provide some early commentary on 2024 and the actions we are taking to continue to deliver on our objectives. As James mentioned, we delivered strong third quarter results. Starting with the top line. We grew organic revenues 11%. Unit case growth was 2%. If you exclude the impact of suspending our business in Russia, we have delivered positive volume growth in each quarter since the start of 2021. Concentrate sales were in line with unit cases for the quarter. Price/mix growth was 9% driven by pricing actions across operating segments, including the impact of a few hyperinflationary markets, along with carryover pricing coming into the base from last year. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 130 basis points driven by underlying expansion and a slight benefit from bottler refranchising, partially offset by the impact of currency headwinds. Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 20 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by strong top line growth and the impact of refranchising bottling operations, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments versus the prior year as well as currency headwinds. Putting it all together, third quarter comparable EPS of $0.74 was up 7% year-over-year despite higher-than-expected 4% currency headwinds. Free cash flow was approximately $7.9 billion year-to-date. This was largely attributable to strong underlying operational performance and working capital benefits, partially offset by $720 million transition tax payment and $230 million in M&A-related payments. Our balance sheet is strong and our net debt leverage of 1.5x EBITDA is below our target range of 2 to 2.5x. Recently, we entered into a letter of intent to refranchise our Philippines bottler. As we progress on our refranchising journey, we aspire to improve the return profile of our business. In 2015, when Bottling Investments Group was more than 50% of our net revenue, our return on invested capital was approximately 17%. Today, Bottling Investments Group makes up less than 20% of net revenue. And our return on invested capital is over 23%, nearly a 7-point increase. After this transaction closes, our remaining assets in the Bottling Investments Group will include operations in India, Africa and several smaller locations, primarily in Asia Pacific. We will remain disciplined in our refranchising approach by making sure we best position our system to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Our business performance year-to-date gives us confidence that we can deliver on our raised 2023 guidance. This is comprised of organic revenue growth of 10% to 11% which will be led by price/mix and includes positive volume growth. We do expect pricing in developed markets to moderate in the fourth quarter as we cycle pricing initiatives from the prior year. There are also a few hyperinflationary markets that will continue to drive price/mix. There will be 1 additional day in the fourth quarter. We now expect comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 13% to 14%. And based on current rates and our hedge positions, we now expect currency to be an approximate 4-point headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 6-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023. Based on current rates and hedge positions, we continue to expect per-case commodity price inflation in the range of a mid-single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2023. We now expect our underlying effective tax rate for 2023 to be 19%. All in, we are updating comparable earnings per share growth of 7% to 8% versus $2.48 in 2022. We continue to expect to generate approximately $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2023 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations. That's approximately $1.9 billion in capital investments. This guidance does not include any payments related to our U.S. income tax dispute with the IRS which are unlikely to occur in 2023. Given the momentum of our business, the strength of our balance sheet and some proceeds that we expect to receive from bottler refranchising, we have increased flexibility to continue to both reinvest in our business and return capital to shareowners. While it is too early to provide specific items on 2024, we want to share some considerations based on what we know today. We're encouraged by our top line momentum across the majority of our markets. There are a handful of hyperinflationary markets where it is either not possible to hedge or it is costly to do so. In these markets, we've demonstrated that we can manage currency pressures by taking price with local market inflation and we will continue to follow this approach. While some commodities are normalizing, we also have input costs that could be impacted by tensions and conflicts. With respect to advertising spend, our bias is to continue to reinvest behind our brands while maintaining flexibility. Regarding currency, if we assume current rates and our hedge positions, there would be an approximate low single-digit currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate mid-single-digit currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2024. Of course, several factors could impact both our currency outlook and broader business outlook between now and February. Over the past few years, we've delivered U.S. dollar EPS growth and we have many levers to continue to do so. So in summary, we are encouraged by our business results and confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments over the long term. Thanks to the incredible commitment of our system employees around the world, we're very clear on the direction we are heading and well equipped to execute on the strategies to get us there. And we continue to invest to drive sustainable long-term growth. We remain focused on capturing the opportunities available to us. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: So clearly, another strong set of results in Q3 and obviously, increased confidence for the year with the full year raise. I'd love to sort of get a bit more perspective on 2024. I know you won't want to put specific numbers around the outlook but was just hoping you can give us a sense for how you think about the pricing outlook for next year, given the strength in Q3 and perhaps break that down into the price increase versus mix versus hyperinflationary market pieces of it and what the competitive environment sort of portends for next year on the pricing front.\nJames Quincey: Let me just offer up a few thoughts, Dara. Firstly, just breaking out Q3 because I think that's instructive as you think about the down end of the year and into next year. Firstly, there are a couple of points in Q3 that's the carryover from the more inflationary environment from 2022. And obviously, that will drop out as we get into Q4 and obviously next year. And then you've got the regular pricing. And then you've got a couple of points of pricing that's coming from these very high inflation markets, Argentina, Turkey and a number of the African markets that, given the levels of inflation, is making a difference at the overall company level. And as John mentioned in the FX guidance, we're assuming some degree of negativity from those markets next year. But we are assuming some degree of positivity in that sense in price/mix next year. The one thing that's uncertain about -- the one thing that's certain about high inflation markets is it ends unpredictably. So it's very early to have a full pitch on what that's going to look like in 2024. And obviously, we'll update when we get to February. So net-net, you're going to have continued moderation heading towards the landing zone in the developed economies. You've got a couple of emerging markets which are subnormal inflation, aka China. And then, you've got a mixed bag of emerging markets and a particular importance is going to be what is the overall journey in these high-inflation marketplaces. So hopefully that provides some parameters with which to think about how it lands in Q4 and into next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: So one of the things that struck me as really interesting is in the release, when you specifically -- first of all, it was helpful that you called out the specific contribution from inflationary pricing. But one thing I thought was interesting is the regions where there was greater inflationary pricing were also the regions where there was at least versus my expectations, better-than-expected unit case volume. So I think historically, right, the logic and the elasticity would say more pricing, less volume. But here, you're getting that unit case volume to come through. So I just wonder if you could talk a little bit maybe about what you're doing differently that's enabling that kind of combination. And then also, if you're able to speak to transaction growth in those markets also if that's pacing -- how that's pacing relative to unit cases.\nJames Quincey: Sure. So firstly, I want to just underline that we have been pursuing for a good number of years but very specifically this year and also will be pursuing into next year is, no matter what the degree of inflation in the environment, we want to protect the scale of our consumer franchise and see it grow. In other words, we want to see positive volume or transaction growth in the environment. And so very much our strategy of the marketing, the innovation, the RGM, the execution has been very much around not just gaining value share in these environments but making sure that there's volume growth embedded in it; so we very much take that approach. And as it relates to the regions where there was inflation, where there's volume, I mean, the two biggest pieces of the puzzle are Latin America and EMEA. And taking those in order, Latin America, the inflationary pricing is very clearly driven by Argentina. The rest of the content, generally speaking, is in the same sort of ballpark, the inflation that has been predominant there for an extended period of time. And it's an environment we very much know how to operate in. And we have a great business there and they very much are masters of executing against the marketing innovation, the execution, the RGM. And then Argentina is a rollercoaster, given its inflation levels and its economic levels. I can say that from personal experience as I was the country manager there in 2001 and 2002 when they had a big devaluation and default on their debt. And so this is something where we know how to operate and it's kind of part of what happens in certain markets in Latin America and so we are able to execute. As it relates to EMEA, divided into two parts. One is the European environment where inflation, much like the U.S., is moderating down and the dynamic in Europe was much more around a moderating degree of inflation and the fact that they had a relatively poor summer in terms of the weather and the consumer is perhaps under a little more pressure than the U.S. The other half of the EMEA group is Eurasia and Africa. And in that context, there are a number of very high inflation marketplaces like Turkey, Zimbabwe as it happens, Nigeria to some extent, Egypt to some extent. And there, when the inflation does spike, you do occasionally see impacts to volume. But overall, we've been able to manage through it so that on a total segment basis, we've carried it through. And we certainly look to, as I said, maintain and grow the consumer franchise, although in some of those markets in any given quarter, the volume may be negative as inflation tends to be much more spiky than the system.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. I had a question on your marketing investments. They were up and, I guess, a drag on operating margins in the quarter; so just hoping for some more color on these reinvestments. And then, James, you mentioned your plans to continue to invest ahead of the curve. So could you provide a little more color on how you're thinking about this? And then ultimately, how much of the top line strength you plan to reinvest in the marketing whether it's this year? And then more importantly, how you're thinking about this next year, especially in the context of greater FX headwinds. I guess trying to understand how flexible you're going to be to balance these reinvestments with driving dollar EPS growth.\nJames Quincey: Okay. Just kind of let me try and unpack that a little bit. So we have come in post-COVID over the last couple of years and said we expected a rebound. And we are going to lean in and invest for growth as long as growth is there rather than trying to pull back in anticipation of something. And that modus operandi, I'm not sure I would characterize extra marketing as a drag on results, more as a motor to driving the top line and the bottom line that we're seeing. So we feel that the leaning in is working, obviously, typified by the fact we've raised both the top line and the bottom line guidance. I think as a model to the extent that we can continue to push that through the end of this year and into next year, we would certainly be happy to do so. Having said that, to the extent that 2024 brings some unexpected surprises, we will pivot, whether it's a country, a region or globally, we will pivot with speed as we did in the second quarter of 2020 when COVID hit and we ramped down marketing spend in that environment. So we feel we've developed a much greater degree of flexibility to move, should moving be needed at whatever part of the world. But as a starting point, we're going to lean in for growth. And I think the last thing I would say is if you think about the balance of all these items, if you take -- if you kind of zoom out a little bit and take a broader perspective of the operating income margin because obviously, marketing is just a component of all the different pieces, if you take a look at operating income margin over the, I don't know, last 5 years or so, you'll see that it's been increasing at about 0.5 point a year operating margin which is broadly in line with the implied leverage in the long-term growth model. And so that has been an objective of ours. It's not going to happen every quarter because quarters are very lumpy but it is part of the way we see our strategy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein from Evercore ISI.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. James, in the past, you've talked that -- Coca-Cola Company has talked about moving the consumer from more commodity packs to the more that, I think you call them incident packs or the higher value-added packs, I'd love to get a sense and maybe we just focus on the U.S. of where you are in that journey, how much room there is to improve mix and is this something that you can do in a weaker economic environment where the consumer is also looking for more affordability and value options.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Thanks, Robert. Look, I absolutely think there's a tremendous opportunity in the U.S. marketplace to leverage greater pack diversity. We're not capturing all the opportunities that are there. And the leveraging of greater pack diversity actually helps in an environment where, as you have in the U.S. at the moment where certain segments of consumers feel under disposable income pressure and would look for more affordable options. And yet, there are plenty of segments either in terms of their income or in terms of the channels they're going and spending in who are more disposed for premium options. So the marketplace offers the opportunity of greater segmentation and diversity of packaging. We have more that we can do in the marketplace in the U.S., whether it be on the nature and the range of the can sizes and shapes or the PET bottles. So I think there's plenty of runway in the U.S. to continue to leverage packaging diversity to satisfy consumer needs and to deliver on the RGM equations that we have the opportunity for in the U.S. And ultimately, you could look at other parts of the world, Latin America or Europe which are relatively developed cold markets and see that we do successfully use more packages there to deliver the business that the consumers want to have.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: So John, I appreciate your commentary about the EPS growth in 2024. And James, you said you would like to see volume growth which is obviously encouraging and in line with what you said in the last earnings call. But given the many moving pieces recently and the weaker consumer in developed markets, number one, is there anything that changed your thoughts sequentially? And two, related to the 80% of the volumes, of course, being abroad and granted that, obviously, is moving the impact of the GLP drugs, I think it would be dismissive not to ask, given investor concerns. Can you talk about how you're proactively approaching this potential risk? Obviously, it's similar to what you have done over the many, many years in terms of the sugar content and portion control but just curious how investors should be thinking of the tools you have at your disposal.\nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Andrea. So on the first point, if you think about 2023 from where we were 12 months ago and what we're guiding to for the rest of this year, it's in an environment that has had the same kinds of ForEx headwinds and much of the volatility that I would expect to continue into the next 12 months or so. And we've demonstrated as we've both highlighted both in the script and in a number of forums, the levers that we have developed over the last few years to effectively manage through those -- a period with such volatility and uncertainty; and I expect 2024 to be a similar type of year. So I would point you to many of these levers are improved marketing and innovation, the revenue growth management abilities that I think year-on-year are getting stronger and the overall execution of our system in the marketplace. So the industry continues to be strong and we expect that to be a feature of our underlying equation for 2024 also. Regarding the second point you raised, it is an area that we are very focused on. There's still a lot of views out there as to what impact, if any, it will have. I would offer -- if you step above us and lock us -- the thrust of our total beverage strategy over the last few years, that we are well positioned to provide choice and to provide options for people's respective motivations and needs. And so we'll continue to monitor the space but we're confident that the total beverage strategy -- 68% of our products have low or no calories today. And we continue to invest in innovation and choice to deal with whatever comes out [ph].\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey: I wanted to ask you a question about Coca-Cola Zero. Growth has decelerated a bit through the year against pretty exceptional unit case growth last year. So I was just wondering if you could reframe where we are with the franchise, the opportunities you see for it and if we're perhaps reaching any thresholds just with the expansion of the offering.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Sure, Chris. I don't think we're reaching a threshold in terms of the expansion of Coke Zero. Actually, I think quite the opposite, I think there's a vast potential for Coke Zero going forward. I think what you see in the very short term is the impact of some of the big Coke Zero markets aka Europe. They also had a very poor summer and run for a couple of months there and that makes it look like it's dipped down in Q3. But I think Coke Zero has plenty of runway going forward and we will continue to invest behind it and are bullish on its long-term potential.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities.\nBill Chappell: Just a little bit on China and I guess, to some extent, Africa. Can you maybe -- this is obviously not the first we've heard of the consumer being a little bit slow to bounce back. But is there anything Coca-Cola can do to accelerate that in terms of pricing or promotion? Or is it really just waiting on the market? And did you see any real changes in that consumer as the quarter progressed, where you ended the quarter with maybe a little more green shoots that things are getting better as we go into the fourth?\nJames Quincey: Yes. Sure, Bill. Obviously, I hate the idea of just waiting for something to happen macro economically. Certainly, it helps when there's a tailwind from the general environment but we're not going to wait for that. We're very focused on investing to try and capitalize on the opportunities and restore momentum, particularly on the sparkling business and there's a lot of RGM and execution opportunities for us to go and tackle in China. Also, we need to get cranked up and have a really strong Chinese New Year which will be in the early part of 2024. And we took a set of decisions in Q3 which created a bit of an impact on the APAC segment margin to really get focused and kind of invest ahead and make some prioritization decisions so that we can really drive the Chinese business forward, hoping that there'll be a plus from the tailwinds of the macroeconomics but we can't wait for that. We need to focus on controlling what we can control and investing to drive the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Charlie Higgs from Redburn Atlantic.\nCharlie Higgs: I've got a question on BIG and the Philippines. And James, maybe can you just talk about the Philippines high level, how the country has performed? And I guess, from a transaction, why now and why CCEP? And then, John, can you just give us some thoughts on what the transaction could mean for FY '24 outlook if it does go ahead, maybe the sales margin, EPS? And then maybe just comment when you said a portion of proceeds from non-operating activities may go towards buybacks, is that -- should we read that as BIG disposals?\nJames Quincey: Sure. Let me start there, Charlie. We have a clear stated objective that we want to be the world's smallest bottler and so over time have been refranchising the operations. We currently hold basically 4 pieces: the Philippines, a large-stage CCBA, a significant part of the system in India and then a number of -- a small number of other countries, about 1/4 in each in rough terms. And so we are long-term, refranchises of the bottling operations we own. In terms of the Philippines, we've had actually a good set of recent years in the Philippines, a good bounce back notwithstanding some ups and downs, given availability or as I said, lack of availability of some critical commodities in the marketplace. But actually, overall, we've had a very good run in the last number of years. And so we've been looking for the right time and the right partners to refranchise to. I think most importantly, this is a combination of a strong, local, long-term investing family, the Aboitiz Group together with some system expertise coming from CCEP. So, I think it's the right combination of partners that can bring bottling expertise and knowledge of the Philippine market -- Philippines market together to continue the track record of what's been achieved. John, do you want to do the other pieces?\nJohn Murphy: Yes. So on the transaction stuff, Charlie, we'll guide in February, assuming that the deal closes. It's -- we're making great progress on that at the moment. And without giving specifics, as you know from history and it will have a revenue headwind and a margin tailwind. And specifics, we'll give more details in February. And with regard to your last -- the last part of the long question, I would say the following. One is we have, I think, developed a strong position and created flexibility, given the momentum we have in the business, the stronger balance sheet we have today versus a few years back and the fact that we do have proceeds coming in from non-operating sources, i.e., the bottler refranchising primarily. We continue to be very focused on reinvesting in the business and returning capital. And as we look at some of these proceeds coming in, we will evaluate their best use, including share repurchases beyond the current objective we have to cover dilution. So more to come on that in February.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: I had one just clarification and then a question. The clarification is, did you give us how much hyperinflationary pricing affected just the total price/mix at the total company level?\nJames Quincey: No, we didn't give a precise number but it's about 2.5 points. It depends which countries you want to add in and where you want to cut the line but think of it as about 2.5 points in Q3.\nBryan Spillane: All right. And then my question is just about North America. I think in the press release, unit case volumes were flat and you called out that you had gained share. And then, James, I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about away-from-home growing faster than at-home. So can you just sort of give us a little bit more perspective on kind of what's happening in North America in terms of both in the relative channel performance, anything you may be seeing in terms of value-seeking behavior with consumers? Just trying to get a better understanding of kind of how your business performed and just kind of what's happening with the category as we got through the quarter.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Firstly, let me start by saying the Nielsen universe represents just under half of our business in the U.S. So the measured channels are just under half of the total business. And what's happening in the consumer landscape is in kind of simplifying it down, the lower-income consumers are those most under pressure and the shopping occasion that's most under pressure is when they're buying for at-home. And so that is the business most captured by Nielsen. And the bit of the marketplace where there's more growth is when consumers are away from home. So there's still very -- still a rebound and strong growth in away-from-home channels, not just some of the restaurants but the amusements, travel, leisure, hospitality, those things. So you're seeing more growth in that part of the marketplace which is unmeasured. And so that's what's really driving the strength of the U.S. business overall and the revenue side. And so you see kind of a divergence of the consumer behavior between at home and away from home. Obviously, who's under pressure from a disposable income is clear. And then that feeds through into kind of the observed measures channels versus the total overall marketplace.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS.\nPeter Grom: So I kind of wanted to follow up on Bryan's question there. I mean, James, you mentioned trade down to private label and discount channels in your prepared remarks. But I think you also mentioned that relative to 2Q, the impact was similar in Europe but actually less pronounced in the markets like the U.S., Australia and Japan. So I would love just to get your perspective on why you think it was less pronounced in those markets? And then as you look out to 4Q and '24, how do you kind of see this trade-down dynamic evolving?\nJames Quincey: Okay. So I think -- look, the European consumer is under slightly more pressure than the U.S. consumer from a disposable income point of view. That's the starting point. So I think that's why you see a little more trading down or tightness on basket size in Europe versus the U.S. And I think that's generally overall true. And then the question of which categories are most pressured by that is really about brand strength and prioritization of occasions by the consumer. So if you've got to save money, you don't trade down averagely across everything, you make a choice in certain categories and you preserve your choices on other categories. So very much our objective is to make sure they value our brands so that they make the choices in the shopping occasion. If there is going to be a reduction in total spend, that obviously happens in some other categories when they trade down to the private label in those ones. And we preserve our brand strengths because we deliver value for them in the product, in the marketing and innovation. And so that's the overall dynamic as we see it. And that's the difference between the U.S. and Europe.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi.\nFilippo Falorni: A question on the Asia Pacific business. James, you mentioned that the India business was very solid but China was weak. First, maybe you can give a comment on how big of a drag China was in the quarter and what are your expectations going forward into next year? And then from a price/mix standpoint, price/mix of one in the segment was one of the lowest across your other segments. I know there's probably some geographic mix impact. But can you talk about the pricing environment as well in Asia Pacific?\nJames Quincey: Sure. Yes. I mean, China was clearly a drag in volumetric terms on the segment. Most importantly, from a margin point of view, it's really important to not over-rotate to the numbers in any given quarter, given the lumpiness of -- this is concentrate sales, several steps back in the supply chain from the consumer. So I think it's important to always take an average of four quarters. In the third quarter, as I commented a little earlier, we made a number of decisions on portfolio prioritization as it related to China and to investing for a fast start in 2024 in a number of markets in Asia Pacific, whether that be Japan or China. And so there are some investments going there. The overall pricing environment is relatively clear. China inflation is relatively minimal. In Japan, we've been taking pricing recently, given the inflation in Japan which is kind of very different to the last 30 years. And then the rest of the inflation is kind of the relatively obvious CPI around the rest of ASEAN and Australia. And so that's really what's driving it. I think see the third quarter in Asia Pacific more as an anomaly in terms of price/mix rather than a trend.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlos Laboy from HSBC.\nCarlos Laboy: Can you speak to the sort of digital investments that the U.S. bottlers are doing and that you're helping them with? Is it more revenue-driven or perhaps more efficiency cost supply chain-centric? I guess in sum, what I'm trying to understand is how are digital investments changing these U.S. bottlers and their capabilities?\nJames Quincey: What was the last bit of the question, Carlos?\nCarlos Laboy: How are these digital investments changing these bottlers and their capabilities?\nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean the U.S. bottler is much like the rest of the international bottlers are undergoing a set of digital investments. And actually, it's both. The answer is not either, it's both. We have been making investments in technology for a long period of time to drive efficiencies through the supply chain, through the manufacturing, through the logistics whether it be old-school technology investments, AI and now generative AIs are kind of a different feature. So there's a lot going on and there's a lot of connectivity among the bottlers on the enterprise software side because they're all connected through -- they're basically all use or most of them use a shared platform to get things done that's referred to internally as CONA. So there's a lot of investment on making sure the supply chain is as efficient as it can be and a lot of support from ecosystem partners to get it done. And then in terms of the rest of the -- I mean, they're investing in the marketplace that digitize the relationship with largely the non-modern trade. Obviously, when you're talking to the big modern retail customers, that interaction is already largely digitized. And the focus there is on trying to intensify the connection, really from a supply chain, inventory visibility and forecasting effectiveness point of view but the connectivity already exists. And then from the non-chain customers, it's really about can you get them on to -- in simple terms, a B2B platform so that it's 24/7 opportunities to order, knowing that if you can digitize the relationship, then it tends to be deeper and more productive. And then once that exists, layering on an AI component which a number of the bottlers internationally have been working on in coordination, an AI-supported kind of B2B relationship over a platform that can then provide them suggested purchase orders. And that is also helping to drive the business. So the U.S. bottlers in that sense are very much on a similar journey to the international bottlers.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge.\nBrett Cooper: Not necessarily looking at the third quarter or year-to-date results but looking over many years, Coke's growth in sparkling and non-sparkling hasn't been meaningfully different, whereas there would seem to be a higher growth opportunity in non-sparkling given just the differential in market share that you hold and the implementation of category cluster management. So can you speak to any impediment to higher growth in non-sparkling or what I'm likely missing? And then, I guess the part B is just within that umbrella, can you talk about your ability to develop newer categories to the company like hot coffee or alcohol?\nJames Quincey: Sure. We -- our objective is to do justice for the brands in the portfolio. And certainly, you can make an argument that those categories where we have lower shares have a natural opportunity to gain share. But of course, that is something you need to take from someone else. The other way of seeing the world is to say that the beverage industry seen from a global perspective are referenced back to the page in CAGNY with all the little people on it, the vast majority of the page is actually white space. In other words, the beverage industry is not yet created. And so actually, the idea that sparkling continues to grow is a representation of us operating from a position of strength to create the industry in the white spaces with our most successful and strongest brands. And so continued growth of sparkling should be a feature of our path going forward. And then in the non-sparkling categories, of course, we are looking to gain share. We talked historically about trying to get from experimental to challengers to leader to quality leadership. And I think that is a long-term build that has been playing out. If you take the long-term perspective and look at the percent of the total business that is made up of non-sparkling brands, it has increased slowly but it has increased consistently over the last couple of decades. So we start from a point of view of being consumer-centric from resource and capital allocation and from earning the right to move up the experimenters into the challenger into the leadership position. Nothing radical is going to happen overnight. But it is a dynamic that has built steadily over the last number of years and decades. And we're confident in the opportunity to rebuild the industry or to build the industry further into the future. Okay. That was the last question, operator. Okay. So to conclude, thanks very much, everyone. We've proven, I hope you can see, in Q3 that we continue to deliver volume, top line growth and incremental U.S. dollar earnings per share by executing against our all-weather strategy. And we're confident that we can create value over the long term. So thank you for your interest and your investment in the company and for joining us this morning.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

Ms. Halpern, you may now begin.\nRobin Halpern: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We've posted schedules under Financial Information in the Investors section of our company website at cocacolacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results, as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our gross and operating margins. In addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC reports. Following prepared remarks, we will turn the call over for questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first and then re-enter the queue. Now I'll turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Robin, and good morning, everyone. After a strong start to the year, we continued our momentum in the second quarter. Our combination of strong love brands and an aligned pervasive distribution system is allowing us to win in many different operating environments. Given our strong first half results and the resilience of our business, we are raising both our top line and bottom line guidance today. To give you the full picture of our results and our raised guidance, I'll start by discussing second quarter performance and provide perspective on the current business and consumer environment. Then I'll highlight our performance across categories, including how we are driving quality leadership throughout our portfolio. Finally, I'll touch on why we're confident in our ability to deliver our long-term objectives and then John will end by discussing our results for the quarter and our revised guidance for 2023. In the second quarter, competing macro forces were at play across our markets. On the positive side, many supply chain pressures eased, concerns surrounding the stability of the banking sector diminished, and energy prices continued to pull back from record highs. However, global inflation was still elevated and geopolitical tensions continued to exist in some markets. Despite this confluence of factors, we delivered 11% organic revenue growth in this quarter. Volume was flat and after a slower start, it sequentially improved, with June being our strongest month in the quarter. In the first half of 2023, we delivered volume growth that was consistent with our underlying performance since 2019. More broadly, our industry is strong and we believe we have significant headroom to grow both volume and value and we continue to gain share. During the quarter, we gained value share in both At-Home and Away-From-Home channels. As we look towards the second half, the global inflationary environment is impacting consumers and our business differently across geographies. In developed markets like North America and Western Europe, inflation is beginning to moderate and labor markets remain strong. Our elasticities continued to be relatively low. However, we have seen some willingness to switch to private label brands in certain categories. Across the sector, consumers are increasingly cost conscious. They're looking for value and stocking up on items on sale. In these markets, our pricing is largely in place and is expected to moderate as we cycle pricing initiatives from the prior year. It's more important than ever to be consumer centric and to partner with customers to provide affordable and premium propositions which deliver value through basket and incidents growth. In many developing and emerging markets like Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, consumers are more accustomed to persistent inflation. However, the number of markets with intense inflation has expanded. Five of our top 40 markets are currently experiencing over 20% annual inflation. In these markets, it's equally important to leverage revenue growth management capabilities to balance affordability with premiumization to be able to take price with local market inflation, which helps offset the currency pressures. There are, as always, a few markets affected by specific local factors. In China, economic recovery slowed in the second quarter and inflation has declined. Consumer confidence is below pre-pandemic levels and we continue to monitor our leading consumer indicators and take action to win in the market. In India, business was unfavourably impacted by unseasonable rain and cooler temperatures in the quarter. However, the growth outlook remains intact. In a world with a wide spectrum of market dynamics, from inflation to currency devaluation to shifting consumer needs, our business is proving to be very resilient. We have many levers to pull to manage successfully through different operating environments, and we remain consumer centric and focused on growth. A Recipe for Success is unchanged. We continue to deliver on our strategy through a combination of world class marketing and innovation, excellence in revenue growth management and strong execution. We are raising the bar and increasing quality leadership across our portfolio. Starting with Coca-Cola. We are growing our base of Gen-Z drinkers, gaining share and leveraging our scale to drive efficiencies across our system. During the quarter, we gained volume and value share by linking Coca-Cola to consumption occasions and engaging consumers through local experiences. A great example is A Recipe for Magic, which was activated more than 50 markets and celebrates consuming Coca-Cola with meals. The campaign was supported by experiences using local chefs, leveraging approximately 750 influencers globally and was brought to life through social media and recipe focused billboards. The Coke and Meals campaign also allows Coca-Cola to strengthen its local relevance. For instance, in the Away-From-Home channel in Italy, Coca-Cola has grown incidence with Pizza, the number one consumed meal with approximately 3 billion pizzas each year from 10% to 20% over the past four years. While the Coca-Cola brand is ubiquitous, we tailor our price pack architecture to consumption occasions and are continuing to drive both affordability and premiumization. During the second quarter, we grew basket incidence and volume per trip by double-digits while increasing price per liter. Moving on to sparkling flavors. We are seeing strong engagement from consumers across our stapler brands, which includes Sprite, Fanta, Fresca and Thums Up. At the same time, we have significant headroom to drive further quality leadership across developed and developing markets. With Sprite, we are driving brand awareness by connecting consumers to passion points and personalized experience at a more granular and locally relevant levels through our global Heat Happens platform. In North America, Sprite celebrated Hip-Hop's 50th anniversary with the launch of Sprite Lymonade Legacy and sponsorship of concert tours, exclusive experiences and collaborations with prominent artists. We partnered with local pop stars and a Grammy producer in China using our global Sprite Limelight music program for Gen-Z drinkers across 1500 college locations. In South Korea, the Sprite Waterbomb Festival similarly generated strong results. In India, the Joke-in-a-Bottle promotion allowed consumers to scan packages and receive customized and localized jokes through WhatsApp to beat the heat. In June, Sprite was awarded Most Resilient Brand by Kantar for adding the greatest number of new households in 2022 of any FMCG brand. Turning to water, sports, coffee and tea. We are segmenting the broader opportunities and using our refreshed resource allocation capabilities to prioritize markets and subcategories that offer the highest return on our investment. We are building our edge through consumer centricity by accelerating the speed to market of our innovation, measuring results in real-time and scaling successes. We continue to build excitement for Fuze Tea through the rollout of Green Tea in Mexico. Some are limited edition in Turkey and expansion of Zero Sugar offerings across Europe. Early results show promising velocities and Fuze Tea grew volume double-digits during the quarter. Vitaminwater is another example. During the quarter, we relaunched Vitaminwater Zero in North America with a new sweetener system of Monk Fruit and Stevia, which generated value share gains. We are capitalizing on consumer needs for rapid hydration, a fast growing sub-segment within sports drinks with the launch of BODYARMOR Flash I.V. in the US and FlashLyte in Mexico. While still early, both saw strong consumer interest during the quarter and have demonstrated promising initial results. Juice value added dairy and plant-based beverages have delivered nine consecutive quarters of double-digit top line growth and gained both volume and value share during the quarter. We continue to innovate and drive premiumization under the Simply trademark, Simply Mixology, which provides consumers with great-tasting mixers and ready-to-drink mocktails. kicked off an experiential campaign that celebrated the start of the summer and its national rollout. Also, Fairlife had another exceptional quarter as both Core Power and Fairlife nutrition plan continued their strong momentum. In May, we announced a $650 million investment to build a state-of-the-art production facility to help drive the next wave of growth. Finally, we are encouraged by what we are seeing across alcohol ready-to-drink beverages. We continue to take a measured approach through exploring and applying our learnings. While it's still early, Jack and Coke has shown promising results. In the Philippines, the combination of Jack and Coke and Lemon-dou delivered strong share gains. The Schweppes Mojito rollout in India is also off to a good start. And these examples illustrate how our marketing transformation is coming to life. The strength of our total beverage portfolio gives us further confidence that we can continue to deliver by providing consumers beverage choices for every occasion. Our purpose is to refresh the world and make a difference. And we remain committed to building a more sustainable future for our company and the planet as we strive to grow our business. We continue to pursue progress toward our vision of a circular economy for packaging through innovation and partnerships. For example, in the US, we recently partnered with Republic Services to ensure we have an adequate supply of recycled plastic for our packaging. At the same time, we are embracing refillables. We recently kicked off a program with customers in four US cities to test refillable fountain cups with plans to expand elsewhere. We've successfully navigated the first half of the year, which supports our decision to raise guidance for the full year. And instead of trying to predict the many directions things could take, we remain focused on delivering our key objectives that we outlined in February. In other words, number one, pursuing excellence globally and winning locally through relentless consumer centricity to drive top-line momentum. Two, investing for the long-term health of our business and raising the bar across all elements of our strategic flywheel. And three, generating US dollar EPS growth. Our system has never been stronger and our global network model is allowing us to quickly adapt to changing environments. We believe we are well positioned to deliver our updated guidance and objectives, thanks to our incredible system employees around the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to you, John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with the momentum of our business and our strong second quarter results. Starting with the top line, we grew organic revenues 11%. Unit cases were flat. As James said, volume for the second quarter got off to a slower start, but ended on a positive note. Concentrate sales were one point ahead of unit cases for the quarter, primarily driven by the timing of concentrate shipments. Price mix growth was 10% for the quarter, driven by carryover pricing coming into the base from last year, along with some new pricing actions across operating segments, including the impact of hyperinflationary markets. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 40 basis points, driven by underlying expansion and a slight benefit from bottler refranchising partially offset by the impact of currency. Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 90 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by strong top line growth and the impact of refranchising bottling operations. Partially offset by an increase in marketing investments and higher operating costs versus the prior year as well as currency headwinds. Putting it all together, second quarter comparable EPS of $0.78 was up 11% year-over-year despite higher than expected 6% currency headwinds. Free cash flow was approximately $4 billion year-to-date. This was largely attributable to strong underlying operational performance and working capital benefits, partially offset by a $720 million transition tax payment that was made during the second quarter as well as M&A related payments. Our balance sheet is strong and our net debt leverage of 1.6 times EBITDA is below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same and we continue to invest to drive long-term growth. As James mentioned, we are encouraged by what we are seeing in the marketplace. While we continue to spend our strategic flywheel faster to generate top line led growth, we've also progressed on a margin agenda, as demonstrated by our consistent track record of offsetting cost headwinds to sustain steady gross margins. We have numerous levers available to drive top line growth and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our spend over the long-term. Our all-weather strategy, coupled with the great plans that we have in place to continue to create quality leadership across our portfolio give us good visibility to deliver on our raised 2023 guidance. This is comprised of organic revenue growth of 8% to 9%, which includes positive volume growth while continuing to be led by price mix. There are a few considerations to keep in mind. We expect pricing in developed markets to moderate through the year as we cycle pricing initiatives from the prior year. In developing and emerging markets, we aim to take price with local market inflation. To the extent that intense inflationary markets drive elevated price mix. The impact is oftentimes offset by currency, as it is frequently difficult to hedge our exposure. Due to our reporting calendar, there will be one additional day in the fourth quarter. We now expect comparable currency neutral earnings per share growth of 9% to 11%. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we are updating our currency outlook of an approximate 3 to 4 point headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 4 to 5 point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023. Inflationary pressures are beginning to moderate in some ways, including freight rates that are favorable compared to last year. That said, several commodities that are prevalent in our basket like sugar and juice remain elevated and we have some hedges that we will be rolling off to less favorable rates. Based on current rates and hedge positions, we continue to expect per case commodity price inflation in the range of a mid-single digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2023. Our updated underlying effective tax rate for 2023 is now 19.3%. All-in, we are updating comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus $2.48 in 2022. We continue to expect to generate approximately $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2023 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations less approximately $1.9 billion in capital investments. If you exclude the transition tax payment made in the second quarter and various payments associated with M&A transactions, our implied free cash flow conversion would be within our long-term guidance. This guidance does not include any payments related to our ongoing US income tax dispute with the IRS. As we enter the second half of the year, we continue to build a culture that emphasizes raising the bar in every aspect of how we do business. Thanks to the tremendous ongoing commitment of our system employees around the world, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our guidance for 2023 and drive value for our stakeholders over the long-term. With that operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. I guess I have a question about just as we kind of look into the back half of the year and looking at organic sales, the implied organic sales guidance, which I guess is in the kind of the 5 to 6% range in the back half of the year. Maybe James and John, can you just talk a little bit about how maybe the just the macro environment or you know the operating conditions are today versus what you were thinking at the start of the year? And given that there's, you know, more of these markets where countries where hyperinflation is an issue, is price a little bit more of a driver in terms of the organic sales comp in the back half of the year relative to volume again versus kind of what you were thinking at the start of the year?\nJames Quincey: Yeah. Good morning, Bryan. Yeah, let me try and unpack that a little bit. I think the headline part of the answer is there's a little more pricing in Q2 and in the downhill than we had expected at the beginning of the year, principally around that basket of countries where inflation is high above 20% and a little more persistent. That's the short answer. The longer version of the answer is, look, we're executing the strategy we've talked about consistently over time and again in CAGNY, the real focus on upping the bar on marketing, upping the bar on RGM, the commercial strategies and the execution of the marketplace. All with the intent about delivering a good strong top line led growth algorithm. And obviously that we've talked historically, that is normal, normal times that 5% to 6% would be split between volume and price on a roughly equal basis. And so what you're seeing in the back half of the year, which I think is important to note, is we're expecting volume to be consistent in the second half with the way it was in the first half, which in the end is running on a trend, if you like, a CAGR versus 2019, similar to what we did last year. So we see, you know, sustained positive volume growth coming out of '22 and we're looking for volume growth in the second half in a very similar way to the first half, whether you're comparing to prior year or to 2019. So we want a business that is growing consumer base for all the right appropriate strategic reasons. Then what's going to happen to revenue in the second half is we're going to see the impact of three buckets of price mix. The first bucket is the carryover of pricing from prior year. Obviously there was more cost inflation last year, but logically that is a set of numbers that is going to tend to zero by the end of December. And so that is going to step down as we go through Q3 and Q4. So bucket one carryover that's going to step down. Bucket two is price increases we've made so far this year that are leaving aside the large inflation countries look much more like a normal year in terms of what we've taken this year, both in terms of timing, number of price increases and relative level of price increases. So we're --\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we are experiencing technical difficulties. Please stay on the line.\nJames Quincey: When did I stop? Operator do you know when the line cut on my answer?\nOperator: Unfortunately not, sir. Our next question will come from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJames Quincey: Hang on, one sec, operator.\nOperator: Oh, sorry.\nJames Quincey: Operator, if you let me just finish the other question.\nOperator: Certainly.\nJames Quincey: I was going to back up. Apologies to everyone for the technical trickiness. I'm just going to back up. And if I'm repeating something I said apologies and if there's a gap in the logic, apologies again. I think we talked about volume second half similar to first half, whether you're talking prior year or 2019 pricing three buckets. The big -- the bigger piece of the pricing of the three factors, which is the carryover obviously stepping down through the year towards zero by the end of the fourth quarter. The new pricing that's come in '23 being very consistent with the kind of our normal level of pricing that we would see. And it's kind of in place already for the year and that obviously then continues at the same rate through the rest of the second half. And the third piece, which is about a quarter of what's happening on PMO at the moment, this bucket of higher inflationary countries. And as I said earlier, there was a little more inflation from those countries in the second quarter than we had previously expected. Obviously that then comes back around in a little more ForEx headwind. We are assuming that some of those inflation rates will moderate in the balance of the year in the second half. And likewise moderate in the ForEx, although it's very uncertain. So we'll have to see what happens. But that's basically the composition of how to think about the effect of our strategy delivering goods, good top line growth in the second half. Next question, operator.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Can you hear me okay? Because like my line's got crackly now. That's okay.\nJames Quincey: Yeah, we got you, Lauren.\nLauren Lieberman: Cool. Good morning. Okay. I wanted to ask a little bit actually about Costa and coffee overall in light of the resource allocation model and identification of key profit pools and so on, not mentioned in the prepared remarks, but definitely called out in the press release this morning with particular strength in the UK. So I guess broad question would be how coffee overall is kind of fitting in on this thought process and resource allocation models if they are getting their particular differences by geography because we've heard different emphasis on the category by different bottlers. And then specific to the numbers called out in the release and Costa UK, should we think about that as recovery with mobility, COVID or tweaks or adjustments to the strategy you've made that are beginning to come through in performance? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Sure, Lauren. Let me do it in reverse order. The Q2, I think, is more recovery than new stages of growth. Having said that, the Express machines have continued to expand numerically in terms of numbers of placements all the way through COVID and including so far this year. So the Express business, the B2B business, the UK is -- has been strong, remains strong and still growing, so gaining share. The retail -- the store numbers are much more about a recovery kind of completing the play on mobility perhaps and gain share a little bit. And obviously, we're focused on how to drive growth going forward, and we see plenty of headroom in the UK market. But I would characterize year-to-date more on -- more of a biased recovery on stores than new and the bias on Express on new. Internationally speaking, in -- if you just break it down into -- there's a couple of different buckets, the ready-to-drink bucket, we've made some good progress in China. We made some good progress in Japan with launches of ready-to-drink Costa in the case of Japan complementing Georgia. And actually Japan had a pretty good start to the year growing both Georgia and Costa. So kind of a full coffee strategy in the ready-to-drink looking good and that's still the most important ready-to-drink coffee market for us. And then the B2B, which is a mix of Express along with kind of we're serving to providing machines and beans, starting to see that getting some traction in Europe with the bottling partners there and starting to kind of find its feet in the US, too. And those are the ones I've called out as the most -- as at front of the program in terms of geographic expansion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning.\nJames Quincey: Good morning.\nDara Mohsenian: So I just wanted to follow-up on Bryan's back half question. You did mention a weaker start in April post the Q1 call and then the stronger June volume performance, obviously, on this call. Is that engendering additional confidence internally around top line? And the reason I'm asking is it sounds like conceptually, you're not necessarily guiding to the June volume strength continuing in the second half. I'm just trying to understand that. Is that more just prudence, given the inflationary environment you mentioned and consumer volatility? Or are there other factors there? And as we think about your full year organic sales growth guidance range as part of that question, was that just the upside in Q2? Was some of it maybe some upside from Q1? Did you change expectations at all for the back half within that full year organic sales growth guidance raise? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: I think, Dara, you might get the prize for the most questions in one question. Look, the -- clearly, in the second quarter, as we had anticipated in the previous call, April has started softly. But then things kind of normalized towards the end of the quarter, and June was a good solid month of growth. But I think the easier way to think about it is take the whole of the first half because you're always going to have some good months and some bad months. April happened to concentrate some price increases in developed countries and bad rains in India. Look, that will always happen on any given month. I think what is a question of what gives us confidence in the back half of the year by just saying January to June with its combination of good, middling and bad months, the growth rate in the first half, what we're expecting is a similar sort of growth rate in the second half, whether you compare to 2022 or to 2019. And so we think the momentum is there. We think in the developed markets, we've got through the pricing that needed to be taken in '23. We don't foresee substantive new pricing in the downhill. But we think this is going to be a well set up run through in the second half. And as I called out on that other answer with Bryan that the uncertainty factor is really around a concentrated in a few of these more inflationary marketplaces. Guidance going up, I guess there's obviously some flow through. We had a good first quarter, obviously, versus consensus. About a second quarter -- we clearly feel confident in our outlook for the full year, which is why we're taking it up. So there's some flow through. Obviously, there's some timing factors in the relative performance in Q2. And as we've talked on previous calls, given the nature of our business and where we sit in the supply chain relative to final sales, I think it's always good to take a multi-quarter average to the way of thinking about volume or pricing or even the flow-through to EPS. And I think that's kind of something that we always think about. Otherwise, you can get too distracted by the ups or downs on any given quarter. So we're going up. In the guidance, we feel confident about the second half. There'll always be some puts and takes, but we think we have a great strategy and a great plan to execute for the rest of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Good morning. I guess I had a question on your Asia Pacific operating margins, which were pressured again this quarter. And then, James, you touched on a couple of markets that are still facing pressures, but just hoping you could share a little bit more color on some of these headwinds in the region. And then any key initiatives you might have implemented to mitigate some of these pressures? And as a result, how should we think about your op margins trending through the remainder of the year in the region? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. As it relates to Asia Pacific, what we -- there's obviously a set of things that happened in Q2 that were specific to Q2. There were some destocking in the China operating unit that was kind of a significant piece there. And there was some strong demand for some of the juice businesses in China and India. And those are two kind of atypical factors that happened that depressed on a timing basis, the margin in Asia Pacific. It is worth noting that there is a sort of structural headwind when seen specifically just at the Asia Pacific region level. And what I mean by that is that we have a very big business in Japan, which is an excellent business and has a good operating margin. But then Asia Pacific concentrates a set of fast-growing emerging and developing markets, India, China, some of the Southeast Asian countries. And given the nature of how fast they grow and their emerging profile, i.e., they have price points that are lower than Japan, they create a negative geographic mix effect to the Asia Pacific reporting segment. And that's been a feature for an extended period of time. In other words, you have to sell one point something cases in India and China to make up to kind of compensate the mix effect relative to Japan. So that kind of structural headwind is always slightly there. Obviously, our objective is through our strategies, our marketing, RGM execution and the way we invest to try and offset that headwind. So if you look back over time, you'll see that the -- whilst the margin fluctuates up and down, it has kind of had a certain stability when you look, for example, 2019 versus 2022. And so I close by saying don't over rotate to one quarter in the case of Asia Pacific, given some of the issues. But I would also point out that this is not a region seen on its own where operating margin is likely to grow all the time because of the structural mix effect. But when seen at the company level, we obviously manage it as part of the overall portfolio so that it is a piece of the puzzle in looking at our total strategy of, as we've talked about, using the levers to hit that top end of the revenue 5 to 6 with a little bit of aggregate operating income margin expansion for the total enterprise. And we understand the role of each segment within that equation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nStephen Powers: Hey, good morning. Thank you. Actually, I want to squeeze in two topics, but I want to pick up first on, James, what you were just talking about in the broader total company context. In the quarter, the top line was obviously strong. But I think relative to external expectations, we saw a bit more margin flow through and SG&A leverage than was expected, especially in regions like North America, where the margin was exceptionally strong relative to history. So I'm curious in terms of how to think about the balance of managing top line growth versus continued margin expansion as you think about the back half. But then also more broadly, just in the context of your top line-led algo, is there may be more cost efficiency opportunities that we should be thinking about longer term? Or is what we see in the quarter maybe more just a matter of timing? I also, John, if I could, I just want to loop back to a question I asked last quarter on below-the-line dynamics. You came into the year talking about below-the-line deleverage, interest expense and so on. We haven't seen that again this quarter, especially with the lower tax rate. So I'm just curious if that has changed in the full year and is that factored in to the full year guidance raise. Thanks for both.\nJohn Murphy: Steve, let me take the second piece first. It's fairly straightforward. In the quarter, we benefited from higher equity income and from interest that we earned on our overseas cash, which was in both cases ahead of what we had assumed when we guided at the start of the year. And for the second half of the year, I don't expect either of those two to be as strong. So I do think we'll have a little bit of deleverage in the second half of the year but modest, not a significant variable for your consideration in the second half of the year.\nJames Quincey: Yeah, back to the margin element of the question. North America, in a way, is a fluid side of what we just talked about in Asia Pacific. Obviously, the results came in very strong in North America on the top line and on the margin. Again, there are a number of timing factors that kind of flatter the second quarter margin structure in the case of North America, including, for example, the -- a bit like the Costa UK bit as it was a much faster growth rate in the Away-From-Home than the At-Home in the North American marketplace. And obviously, that's margin accretive. That should be seen as, in a way, more completing the play of the recovery versus COVID. So the completion of the reopening of restaurants, cafes, theme parks, et cetera, et cetera. And so that channel mix, if you like, flatters the operating income in the short-term. There's a number of timings of other things that impact that, BODYARMOR integration, et cetera. I think the way to think about margin going forward by segment and most importantly for the company overall is, firstly, not to overrotate on any one quarter. Remember that there are a number of expense items and deduction items that we accrue on the basis of sales curve, not just what actually happened in the quarter. So timing is a feature. And that's why I'm very strong and let's take four quarters in a row and look at that relative to history. And when you do that, whether in North America or Asia Pacific or more importantly, the company in the overall, what you're going to see is us sticking to our strategy, which is to drive the growth from the top line and then to look for modest or moderate increments of the operating margin, which we deliver not just by effective strategies to allocate resources, whether they be marketing or operating expenses so that we are efficient and get a little bit of leverage there. But the design of the portfolio itself and the RGM strategies also is a component in creating sales that inherently have a little more gross margin. So we use all the levers to try and deliver. And so don't take these segments over or under deliveries as a sign of something new and radical happen. They are features of our business model. And the big overall idea is top line growth with small increments of operating margin expansion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. James, I'd like to talk about the global system. Recently, there's been a lot of interesting developments from some of the bottlers. You had CCH by Finlandia. You've had a lot of your bottlers, particularly in Latin America and elsewhere, talk about B2B platforms that they're developing. And so my question is, how are you thinking about these developments? Are there new models, revenue, earnings sharing models? And how do you make sure that the bottlers stay focused on those products that drive the most value for The Coca-Cola Company? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Let me start just by headlining actually, we've just come off. Last week, we had a global bottler meeting in Atlanta. I think it's in 30-plus years since we had that meeting in Atlanta, but we had it in Atlanta last week with the majority of the biggest bottlers in the Coke system. And I think it was a very clear meeting on our collective will and ability and interest in investing in this business and our overall level of alignment on what's important and what should we drive individually and what needs to be driven collectively. So actually, you guys all go around and talk to the bottlers as well, and I think you will get it reflected back from them that there is a very high degree, not just an alignment on what needs to be done, but enthusiasm on the opportunities ahead of us to drive the business, our collective business forward. On some of the specifics, clearly, you've got in that basket, there are things that happen around the world that are local and a better set of dynamics that are important and relevant and not necessarily projectable around the world. And the case of CCH and the distribution, now the ownership of Finlandia, I think, is one of those. The B2B platforms, which are progressed very nicely in Latin America are a feature of the business in multiple other countries. We've been testing and exploring and developing individually and collectively B2B platforms with the principal objective of enhancing the system and most importantly, the bottlers' relationships with the retailers. To the extent that we can complement, and here we're largely talking the fragmented channel because the relationship with the modern trade is already set on electronic platforms anyway. We're talking about the fragmented trade, and the majority of the almost 30 million customers we visit as a system is to enhance that relationship, to make it no longer hostage to the visit of the Coke sales rep but to make it a 24/7 opportunity to enhance relationship, to order product, to ask for a service call, to get a new cooler, to put some umbrellas up or to add to an order that's already about to be delivered. And that is certainly when we have evaluated how those customers where the B2B platforms are available how they're doing versus where it's not yet rolled out. There's clearly an improvement, not just in the relationship however you want to measure it, but also in the sales. So there's a lot going on in the system. And I think the last thought there is you should take it also as examples of the willingness of the system to experiment and try and be on the front edge of what drives value in the marketplace.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChristopher Carey: Hi. Good morning.\nJames Quincey: Good morning.\nChristopher Carey: You made a comment on some private label switching happening in certain markets. Can you just expand on where you're seeing this specifically geographically and perhaps by category and the playbook that you'll be deploying in these markets, the sorts of developments that you'd be looking for to respond to these actions ahead? And I asked that a bit in the context of, clearly, some of your ingredients are still quite inflationary and whether you see any potential risk to being able to price against that inflation in some of these markets going forward. Obviously, you have a playbook with a lot of different levers. And I'm just curious to hear your thoughts on where these developments seem to be happening and how do you think about responding to these a bit more specifically. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. So private label switching is principally a feature firstly in Europe, and then to some extent also in the US. If you were to include price brands or B brands, you might see some of that also in Latin America depending on how you want to define it. But very specifically on private label, that's number one, a European effect; and number two, a US effect. And it's, in our view, highly related to the strength of the brands in any specific category. So we see it more in terms of beverages, happening in water and juices rather than soft drinks and certainly less when you get to colas. The strategy on top of what we need to do in terms of marketing and continuing to make the brands relevant to the consumers and executing in the marketplace is, of course, the RGM strategy. Yes, premiumization remains an opportunity, but we need to keep an anchor and continue to evolve and adapt our strategies on affordability, whether that be refillables, whether it be affordable small packs or affordable future consumption packs, that has become something that is a tested strategy in inflationary environments, well learned in Latin America, for example, but now applied, has been for a number of years in Europe and in the US. And we have more things we can do in both marketplaces to have an anchor in both affordability and premiumization. And that's a playbook that we're rolling out and executing in those marketplaces. As it relates to the inflation and the COGS coming through, obviously, some of that, whether it be juice or sugar and corn syrup, affects different markets. The most of the inflation is in a set of markets where we do price for local inflation. And in a way, the higher inflation gets, the more likely it is we're just -- you're going to follow inflation. And so the risk not following is not really there as it goes up. The risk actually appears on the volume side. But this is a select group of markets. So if it were to err towards the more inflation in the back half of the year, we think it's manageable. If we were to err for the less inflation, that would be good, but we think it's in a bucket of manageable things. And as it relates to the total company relative to some of those input costs, we have very long-term relationships with most providers and long-term hedging programs, which allow us to kind of -- they don't avoid inflation, but they smooth it that they make it much more manageable from a pricing and packaging point of view.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nFilippo Falorni: Hey, good morning, everyone. Can you guys talk a bit more about your alcohol strategy broadly, particularly with the Red Tree beverages subsidiary? And specifically in terms of like new innovation, any other subcategories or areas where you're looking to expand within alcohol? I know you're experimenting, but just any color on the future plans will be great. Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Thanks, Filippo. Look, the Red Tree entity that we stood up in the second quarter is more of a technicality than some new big step. It isn't a change of strategy, and it's not a vehicle to distribute in the US. It allows us a better platform to engage with the partners that we're working with in the US in terms of coordinating and influencing the marketing and allows us a better separation of the alcohol versus the non-alcohol band. So it's more an optimization of the model and how we want to execute things rather than a different thing. And then in terms of progress, look, it's still a small part of the business. And as I talked about, I think it was CAGNY, that's great, and there are lots of runs on the board. Jack and Coke has got some really promising nice results, including in the US. Simply Spiked Peach is performing very nicely in the US. If you want to look for a really bright spot, you can hedge the Philippines and Jack and Coke and Lemon-Dou, which is an alcoholic lemon drink, got well over 30% share of the RTD category. All of this is very encouraging as we continue to take a measured approach to this and to kind of learn and apply our learnings. All of this needs to generate belief that it can be material for the Coke company, not just a nice business, and that we're still in the process of driving towards. But certainly, so far, we're pleased with what's taken place and we are encouraged about the next steps that we have to take.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you for squeezing me in. And James, on your volumes commentary, and I appreciate that on your four-year CAGR, I think if our math is correct, it's 1.7% unit case for total company, which is obviously remarkable. That said, I think, EMEA was a bit softer in the quarter. I understand your commentary about Russia. And what is actually happening in EMEA ex-Russia? And how we should be thinking going forward? And related to that, since you commented that the US was very strong out of home, and Europe is a big percentage of Europe is out of home, on the comments about June, how we should be thinking not only about Europe, but the performance of on-premise against off-premise globally? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Hang on, I'm trying to process all the questions. I think you've beaten that was, Dara? I think you've beaten, Dara. EMEA was a bit soft. Yes. I think on EMEA, we are -- it was even though -- so on EMEA, we're expecting EMEA to be positive in the second half. And so there was a ramp effect from the withdrawal from Russia in the second quarter. But we -- so Europe was in pretty good shape, actually, Europe ex-Russia. If you take the first half, Europe ex-Russia was positive. So we are feeling that now it's dropped out of the base numbers in the second half that actually Europe and EMEA will be in good shape. Obviously, EMEA has got a couple of the hyperinflationary countries like Turkey, like Pakistan, so EMEA could get other effects. But if you concentrate where Russia is, which is Europe, which is the biggest impact, actually, Europe had a positive volume in the first half if you take out Russia. And so we're feeling good about Europe as we go into the second half. And I think the question really is the trade-off between pricing and volume in a couple of countries, particularly Turkey and Pakistan and for those that want to go deep down the rabbit hole, Zimbabwe as well. Now the next part of the question, which was about our Away-From-Home versus At-Home. Yes. It wasn't just June, which was the strength in the US basically the first half. You've seen the Out-Of-Home growing ahead of the At-Home and the recovery. And I think that's the way to think about it is we're seeing the back-end of the recovery in the Away-From-Home. Similarly, in Europe, in fact, globally, transactions were ahead of volume, which tends to imply smaller packages are growing faster than bigger packages from a mathematical point of view. So as a global feature, there's a little more on-premise consumption or a little more small package consumption than large package consumption, which helps as well. But I don't think we should see this as a new secular trend, more the kind of the last bit of renormalization post-COVID.\nOperator: Our final question today will come from Peter Grom from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. So James, maybe just two quick follow-ups. One, just on Chris' question around trade down and improving affordability. Do you expect any changes in the promotional environment, particularly in North America? It doesn't sound like that's a shift you expect, but just wanted to be sure. And then just following up on your response to Andrea's question, I would be curious how you see channel mix evolving as consumers seek more value in some of these developed markets, particularly just given the strength from Away-From-Home that you just alluded to? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: We see the US pricing and promotional environment as pretty rational. We have a set of strategies in place to try and balance our premiumization, regular and affordability strategies in the US, which includes a little more promotion than the first quarter. But basically, promo levels are very similar to prior years and not as a step up. And we think that we have the right balance of premiumization and affordability plays to be able to continue to gain as we did in the second quarter volume and value share in the US. So we think the environment is rational. We think our strategy works for us because we gain volume and value share. And we've got the right mix of -- roughly the right mix of promo and price. And obviously, we're going to continue to push the affordability and the premiumization play. And then the channel mix question, do we think we'll see in developing markets -- I think the principal feature is a renormalization post-COVID. I don't think it's kind of recessionary or inflationary or that. I think it's just been -- we've kind of seen a renormalization of the channel mix. We had talked over prior years about how big an impact on price mix and margin structure, the shift in channels were with what seems ages ago, the lockdowns. That has now largely played out, which is another way of saying, we don't expect channel mix to be a major feature of the discussion in quarters and years to come.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Thank you, operator. So just to quickly summarize. Second quarter results, I think, demonstrate the momentum we have in the marketplace. We are navigating a broad set of dynamics in the local markets while driving scale and maintaining flexibility at a global level. We're confident in our ability to deliver on our '23 guidance and our longer-term objectives. Thanks for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "KO", "quarter": 1, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-04-24 00:00:00", "content": "Operator: At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to The Coca-Cola Company's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations department if they have any questions.\n I would now like to introduce Mrs. Robin Halpern, Vice President Head of Investor Relations. \n Mrs. Halpern, you may now begin. \nRobin Halpern: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer.\n We've posted schedules under financial information in the Investors section of our company website at coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our growth and operating margins.\n In addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC report. Following prepared remarks, we will turn the call over for questions. [Operator Instructions].\n Now I'll turn the call over to James. \nJames Quincey: Thanks, Robin, and good morning, everyone. 2023 is off to a good start. We continue to execute well and grow amidst the dynamic macro environment. We like to say we have an all-weather strategy, one that enables us to thrive no matter what's happening in the world.\n We pursue excellence globally with an eye towards winning locally as a system. And our brand investments continue to create value for our customers and consumers, leading to our ability to drive quality growth for our stakeholders.\n Today, I'll discuss our first quarter performance and provide some perspective around today's global consumer and macro environment. I'll then reiterate why we are confident in our ability to deliver on our guidance for the full year. And finally, I'll elaborate on how the actions we're taking set us up for success in any environment and how we're driving resilience for our business and continued growth in 2023 and over the long term. John will then discuss our results and go into more detail on the 2023 outlook.\n In the first quarter, pandemic restrictions in parts of the world relaxed, and many supply chain pressures abated. At the same time, inflation and geopolitical tensions persisted. And new concerns emerged around the stability in the banking sector and the magnitude of the potential squeeze on consumers.\n In the face of these factors, we continue to generate momentum as investments in our brands got the year off to a positive start. We remain focused on creating value by meeting the needs of our customers and consumers.\n We delivered 12% organic revenue growth in the quarter. This was primarily driven by pricing actions across markets and revenue growth management initiatives to retain and add consumers.\n We also delivered volume growth of 3%, which is in line with last year versus 2019. We saw growth across developed as well as developing and emerging markets, and we continue to gain both volume and value share for the quarter, including at home and away from home channels. We're encouraged by this momentum and are operating the business with a focus on growth while closely monitoring macro trends for signs of a slowdown. \n As we look around the world today, the consumer picture varies across our markets. In Asia Pacific, the reopening of China has led to an increase in consumer activity, but consumption is still recovering to pre-pandemic levels. India's economy remains resilient with a strong job market and robust consumption. In Japan, consumers are feeling inflationary pressure for the first time in many years.\n In Europe, the recent banking crisis added to last year's energy spike, driving further uncertainty to purchasing behaviors and consumers continue to increasingly seek out affordable and private label options across many FMCG categories.\n In North America, the picture is a mixed bag with unemployment low, gas prices improved and savings holding up, but inflation and higher mortgage rates are top-of-mind concerns for many consumers.\n In many developing and emerging markets in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, consumers continue to face varying levels of inflation and volatility in the macroeconomic conditions. Clearly, there's uncertainty in how the consumer environment may ultimately play out in 2023. But thanks to the hard work of our people and partners, we're a more flexible network enterprise today. And with our enhanced system alignment, we're confident we can win together locally in a wide variety of environments.\n Let's start with the portfolio. We have a growth portfolio of consumer-centric brands across categories, including [ 26 billion-dollar brands ]. Our networked organization is allowing us to raise the bar of innovation and marketing to leverage our loved brands more effectively in the marketplace. We're keeping our streamlined portfolio of brands relevant with consumers and finding innovative ways to offer beverage choices for every occasion.\n In Japan, we recently relaunched our Georgia Coffee brand with a fresh new look and a bright proposition to inspire current consumers and expand Georgia's appeal to a broader audience, complementing Costa's premium ready-to-drink offerings in that market.\n We're expanding our exploration in alcohol ready-to-drink beverages with a keen focus on responsibility. We work with Brown-Forman to roll out Jack and Coke cocktails in the U.S. during the quarter with more markets launching now. It's early days, but the ability to get one of the most popular [indiscernible] in the world in a can is proving to be compelling to retailers and consumers based on preliminary volumes and velocities. We're encouraged by the level of engagement as distribution expands.\n We're driving bigger and bolder innovations that can leverage consumer insights leading to a higher success rate and enduring growth. In North America, we continue to foster brand love for fairlife, which has grown volume double digits for 8 consecutive years. Fairlife became a $1 billion brand last year, and we're building on the momentum of the brand including the success of co-power with fairlife nutrition plan. Launched with a digital-first campaign in the club channel, fairlife nutrition plan has seen strong consumer interest from those looking for high-protein, low-sugar shake that tastes great and is lactose-free. We're planning to expand the product to more channels and packages in the coming months.\n We're working with WPP, our global marketing network partner, and increasingly leveraging digital capabilities to engage consumers through passion points, personalized experiences and collaborations. The Coke Studio concept first drove cultural relevance and brand performance in Pakistan, with the latest season streamed over 1 billion times. We scaled the program to 30 markets last year. And in 2023, it will become an always-on platform across the globe. Connecting consumers' love of music to consumption occasions by spotlighting breakthrough talent, Coke Studio provides a portal to live digital experiences and can be activated using QR codes on our packages.\n Consumers can drink, scan and enjoy their favorite beverage along with music from genres around the world. Working as a network system with our bottlers, we're managing through macroeconomic uncertainty with enhanced capabilities in revenue growth management and integrated execution. We often talk about the many levers of revenue growth management. While the inflationary environment led to proactive pricing increases over the past 18 months, it's important to recognize our RGM capabilities to extend far beyond pricing.\n At its core, revenue growth management is about consumer-centric segmentation, ensuring we have the right product in the right package in the right channel at the right price point, drive transactions and meet consumers where they are.\n Affordability and premiumization are key levers to maintain and expand our consumer base, and we continue to balance affordable offerings with compelling premium propositions to ensure we have beverage options across income levels.\n Affordability is a driver in developing and emerging markets, evidenced by double-digit volume growth in these offerings in Indonesia and Vietnam, helping to drive record sparkling share in Vietnam and driving approximately 3 billion transactions at affordable price points in India this quarter. Premium packages like slim cans and mini cans are seeing strong growth in many markets, including Australia, where mini cans drove 40 million transactions and contributed to share growth in the region.\n Premiumization also includes [indiscernible] occasions. In addition to alcohol, ready-to-drink beverages, we're also participating more broadly in adult alcohol drinking occasions.\n In North America, we've expanded our Simply premium juice brand into the mix of segment with Simply mixology in 3 flavors to serve as a cocktail or mocktail. In Europe, we've relaunched our Kinley and Royal Bliss brands as harmonized platforms to participate in the adult mixer segment.\n For both affordability and premiumization, the value proposition is often messaged at the point of sale, such as the expansion of the value bundle in certain channels in the U.S. and the mini can mini price campaign that drove strong growth in small packages in Japan. RGM, coupled with integrated execution, also drives value for our customers. By providing key insights and offering the right mix of brands, packages, price points and compelling data-driven promotions, we are able to partner with customers that deliver traffic, basket and incidence growth.\n Latin America is a great example of how this came to life in the first quarter, evidenced by revenue growth ahead of transactions and transaction growth ahead of volume. By working closely with key retailers, our system focused on the availability of cold, single-serve beverages in premium brands such as Schweppes and smartwater.\n We introduced refillable packages into new channels, all while driving better in-stock levels and higher consumer traffic in-store, owning accolades from customers. Our business has largely recovered from the effects of the pandemic and remains well equipped to navigate the dynamic macro environment and is emerging with even stronger capabilities and system alignment to deliver vibrant long-term growth for many years to come.\n At the same time, our consumers also care about sustainability. While we strive to grow our business, we also want to be water positive, drive a circular economy for our packaging and grow consumer beverage choices, including low- and no-calorie brands as part of our total beverage strategy. These goals are integral to our business and beneficial for society.\n Our annual business and sustainability will be released soon, including an integrated section on our World without Waste packaging initiatives. We're proud of what we've accomplished so far, recognize there is still opportunity ahead and continue to lead as well as act collectively with other key stakeholders to drive progress on this agenda. I encourage you to learn more about how we're progressing against our targets across various sustainability pillars and priorities to refresh the world and make a difference.\n Before I hand over to John, I'd note that it's early in the year, and there's a fair amount of uncertainty around the operating environment ahead. But our first quarter results give us increased visibility to deliver on our full year 2023 guidance.\n We're executing more efficiently and effectively on a local level, maintaining flexibility on a global level and continuing to reinvest in the business and build the system for the long term. In short, we're expanding the sphere of what we can control. We're well prepared to respond with speed to changing market dynamics as we've demonstrated that we can do. By staying clear on our purpose and remaining consumer-centric, we continue to execute to the sustainable long-term growth.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to John. \nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. We've had a good start to the year with strong first quarter results. Starting with the top line. We grew organic revenues 12%. Unit cases grew 3% with broad-based growth across most markets, driven by investments in the marketplace.\n Concentrate sales were 2 points behind unit cases for the quarter primarily driven by timing of concentrate shipments and 1 less day. Our price/mix growth was 11% for the quarter. Much of this was driven by carryover pricing coming into the base from last year, along with some new pricing actions across operating segments as well as revenue growth management initiatives and favorable channel and package mix.\n Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 120 basis points driven by underlying expansion and a slight benefit from bottler refranchising, partially offset by the impact of currency. Underlying gross margin expansion was driven by a benefit from the phasing of inventory costs, strong organic revenue growth and cycling the timing of M&A integration expenses, partially offset by higher commodity costs.\n Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 40 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by underlying operating margin expansion due to robust top line growth across operating segments, partially offset by increased marketing investments and higher operating costs. Putting it all together, first quarter comparable EPS of $0.68 reflects an increase of 5% year-over-year despite higher-than-expected 7% currency headwinds.\n Free cash flow was negative by approximately $120 million in the quarter. This was largely attributable to the timing of working capital initiatives and the previously discussed M&A-related payments that took place in the quarter.\n Our underlying cash flow generation remains strong, and we feel confident in our cash flow agenda and full year outlook. Our balance [ achieves ] fit for purpose to support our growth agenda, and our net debt leverage of 1.8x EBITDA as of the end of the first quarter is below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x.\n Our capital allocation priorities remain the same. We continue to invest to drive long-term growth and to deliver dividend growth for our shareowners as evidenced by the 5% dividend increase announced in February.\n We remain mindful of maintaining our financial flexibility amidst the ongoing tax dispute with the IRS. We are currently waiting for the tax court to render its final opinion in the case, allowing us to move forward with the appeals process. As previously discussed, we intend to assert our claims on appeal, vigorously defend our position and believe we will ultimately prevail. We will continue to keep you updated.\n As James mentioned, we are encouraged by our first quarter results and are harnessing what we can control to remain resilient in the face of a volatile operating environment. We remain laser-focused on top line-led growth as well as the endurance of the bottom line. And we'll reinvest in our brands with more rigor and discipline using the refreshed resource allocation framework we discussed at CAGNY.\n This approach enables the enterprise to prioritize and put more focus behind country and category combinations that can deliver the best return in the near term while fueling steady progress on our total beverage strategy over time, it also allows us to be more dynamic and to adapt quickly.\n For example, in emerging markets, where commercial beverages are still a small part of daily consumption, we're leading with core sparkling and juice strengths propositions. In developed markets, where consumers are looking for more beverage choices, we're investing behind a broader portfolio of brands and categories, including value-added dairy, enhanced water, tea and coffee.\n Despite the global macro picture remaining uncertain in the months ahead, our planned investments and operational strategy will support the momentum we've seen early in the year and give us good visibility to deliver on our 2023 guidance. This guidance is comprised of organic revenue growth of 7% to 8%, primarily led by price/mix amidst the ongoing inflationary environment, comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 7% to 9%.\n Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we are reiterating our currency outlook of an approximate 2- to 3-point headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 3- to 4-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023.\n Inflationary forces are moderating in some respects. Spot prices have come down in oil and freight rates are more favorable. That said, many commodities were exposed to have been sticky, and we have some advantageous hedges that will be rolling off to less favorable rates during the year.\n Based on current rates and hedge positions, we continue to expect per case commodity price inflation in the range of a mid-single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2023. Additionally, we expect wages and inflation in media will continue to remain elevated.\n Despite the increase in the first quarter effective tax rate, we continue to expect our underlying effective tax rate to be 19.5% for 2023. All in, we are reiterating comparable earnings per share growth of 4% to 5% versus $2.48 in 2022.\n We expect to generate approximately $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2023 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $1.9 billion in capital investments. I would like to remind you that included in cash from operations are 2 discrete items related to, one, transition tax payments, which will take place in the second quarter; and two, payments associated with M&A transactions. Excluding these, our implied free cash flow conversion would be within our long-term guidance.\n This guidance does not include any payments related to our ongoing U.S. income tax dispute with the IRS. Overall, we don't expect the tax dispute to have a bearing on our ability to deliver on our capital allocation agenda and drive long-term business growth.\n There are some considerations to keep in mind as it pertains to our guidance. We expect price/mix to moderate through the year as we cycle our pricing initiatives from the prior year. The discrete gross margin benefits related to the phasing of inventory costs and cycling the timing of M&A integration expenses this quarter are unlikely to repeat. Given the ongoing backdrop of rising interest rates, we expect to see higher net interest expense given our effective exposure to floating rate debt.\n And finally, due to our reporting calendar, there will be one additional day in the fourth quarter. With a quarter of good results to start the year and our focus on driving top line-led growth in any macroeconomic environment, we are well positioned to compound quality value by delivering on 2023 guidance.\n Our network structure and aligned system are enabling us to deliver on our 3 key objectives: pursuing excellence globally and winning locally, investing for the long-term health of the business and generating U.S. dollar EPS growth. The strength of our people and great partnerships with our bottlers around the world give us confidence in our ability to win with consumers in the marketplace and deliver value for our stakeholders.\n With that, operator, we are ready to take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. \nDara Mohsenian: So first, just a detailed question. You guys obviously started out with a pretty robust initial outlook for work sales of 7% to 8% for the full year in 2023. Obviously, a strong start in Q1. You kept that full year guidance. So just can you give us a sense, did Q1 come in better than you expected? Was this more expected, why not move on the full year? And within that, can you also comment on away-from-home trends [indiscernible] as we recover from COVID and what you guys are expecting in the balance of the year, including in China, which is probably in a different place in the rest of the world. \nJames Quincey: Sure. Let me start at the back end and come in reverse. So yes, China opening up, certainly a pattern of consumer behavior not unlike when U.S., Europe opened up, so there has been a resumption in consumer activity. There was a rebound of consumption in Chinese New Year, which obviously fell in the first quarter. So we're certainly seeing the performance in China getting better. And we've been focused on bringing back our marketing and increasing availability in some of the rural marketplaces.\n Remember, in Q2, we'll be cycling the toughest part of '22, I think, for China. But net-net, we remain cautiously optimistic. I mean, it's still -- the Chinese business is still below the 2019 level. But we're cautiously optimistic on the rest of the year for China.\n The other part of Q1 and the away from home as much as it seems incredible to remember, Q1 last year was -- we were still talking about Omicron and not everywhere was opened up. So we are seeing in the first quarter this year additional strength in the away-from-home business, so take the U.S. as an example, immediate consumption packages grew ahead of future consumption packages. The away-from-home channels, for example, QSR restaurants, had a good strong quarter the first quarter this year, in part because we're cycling a partially open first quarter.\n And that will logically moderate that as we get into the rest of the year because now we're starting to cycle the opening. So hopefully, that does the 2 pieces.\n Look, overall, first quarter was strong. It was certainly within the bounds of our expectations and our plans. We talk very much in February about how we expected to be able to focus on having volume growth continuing to build the franchise of our beverages across the whole year, but expecting to see pricing moderate from what was similar levels to Q4, which is what we see in Q1, back down to some more normal levels by the end of the year.\n And so good, strong start. And we're maintaining guidance, we still feel confident in our guidance, and we're well equipped. The outlook has a degree of uncertainty in it that's, I think, more elevated than pre-COVID, obviously not COVID-driven. But there's plenty of uncertainty out there in terms of the direction of travel, of inflation, both the consumers' reaction to it and the input side.\n So we have a set of guidance out there that sees both input costs, our own costs and pricing moderating through the year, but there's still a long way to go. So I think take it as we feel good about our guidance. There's a lot left to manage. We have a good strategy, and we're certainly focused on this kind of all-weather results as we go into the rest of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. \nLauren Lieberman: One of the things that stood out to me this quarter was the profitability in North America. So I was just curious if you could comment on that. It looked like margins kind of reached toward a new high watermark. And I was just curious how much of that -- if there was anything onetime or if it has to do with portfolio mix and realization of pricing? \nJames Quincey: Sure. Do you want to do it, John? \nJohn Murphy: Sure. Thanks, Lauren. Yes, on the back of what James just said, a strong start to the year. We expected in Q1 to see North America coming out to [ Gates ], given the carryover pricing that we knew would be a tailwind for the quarter.\n We also saw benefits from immediate consumption been strong through the quarter. And as we look to the rest of the year, we continue to keep in mind our ongoing objectives to expand margins.\n But Q1 was, let's say, we came out of the gate strong, we knew we would. And we look to the rest of the year in line with what James is saying to moderate as we get into the back half of the year on the pricing front and to continue to be laser-focused using our RGM work to stay with the consumer.\n So we feel good about the start. Rest of the year is looking positive. And yes, we'll take into account, I think, some of the trends we're seeing on the macroeconomic and consumer front and manage the -- that environment with the various levers we have. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. \nBonnie Herzog: I had a question on your business in Europe. Organic sales in the quarter were incredibly strong. You're up 23% on a tough comp. So just curious if you could help us unpack this a bit more. Maybe touch on the resilience of the consumer. How big of a factor the mild winter was? And then were there any countries within Europe that were particularly strong, for instance? \nJames Quincey: Yes. Thanks, Bonnie. Look, firstly, EMEA is more than just Europe. That's the first key point. It includes some countries that had some near hyperinflationary effects of Turkey and there's an impact in the first quarter of high inflation in Turkey, which has kind of pushed the price/mix up more than would be normal.\n Secondly, of course, there's some carryover pricing from the inflationary burst that happened in kind of the European Union, certainly U.K. last year. And that will moderate as we go over '23 as is likely to be the Turkish inflation. There's some mix benefits of Western Europe having, as you said, a relatively mild winter. And so despite the pressures on purchasing power, actually, Western Europe had a very good first quarter. And that's good in its own right, but it's also good in a mix effect within EMEA. So kind of everything did pretty well.\n A number of the other Middle Eastern and African countries did well, perhaps with the exception of Nigeria. So it was a strong overall result. Lots of mix in there, and as I said, a bit of an inflationary effect between carryover and Turkey that will moderate in the rest of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. \nBryan Spillane: John, I wanted to just touch back on some of the gross margin comments you made earlier. And I guess, looking at the slide deck, right, there was about 140 basis points of gross margin benefit, underlying gross margin expansion in the quarter.\n Can you just give us some sense of how much, I guess, the inventory phasing and the lapping of the M&A integration costs, just how much of the stuff that, I guess, is kind of more onetime impacted that 140? And I guess as we're thinking about pricing fading through the year, would we be kind of more looking at kind of flattish maybe gross margins as we move through the balance of the year? So if you could just kind of give us a little bit more color on those items would be helpful. \nJohn Murphy: Yes. Thanks, Bryan. So of the 140 basis points, you're correct. The -- included in that is the onetime on the inventory and the cycling of M&A. It's about half of that. The other half comes from -- mainly from the carryover price and some favorable price/mix in the quarter.\n So as you think about the rest of the year, I would keep in mind the following. As I just mentioned in North America, I think it's across the board. Moderation on price, both rate and frequency. I think a greater use of our RGM levers to help to stay with the consumer as we see the consumer in different states, in different parts of the world.\n We will have some FX headwinds similar to what we had in Q1 throughout the year, we -- is our current expectation. We'll have an extra day in the fourth quarter. And so I'd keep in mind that we have interest in our long-term algorithm, an ongoing objective to expand margins, and that remains very much the focus, but you take those items into account for the rest of the year as you think about 2023 full year. \nJames Quincey: I would also say like we've talked about it historically on pricing volume. I would encourage people not to draw correlations through 1 quarter. And you can use full quarters or annuals. Given acquisition relative to the bottlers and the final consumer, I think it's important to kind of average out some of these effects through all the various variables that John mentioned and take a multi-quarter view of what's going on and take that all into account. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. \nStephen Robert Powers: Just maybe first, just a quick clarification. John, I think as you started, you had talked about an expectation of bottom line or below-the-line deleverage on higher interest costs and the like. This quarter, we saw that work in your favor just because of the higher other equity income and just wanted to get an update as to whether you still expect to deleverage on the year or if the first quarter changes that outlook.\n My broader question was back to revenue growth management. And James, you talked about affordability versus premiumization, which has been a theme. I was wondering if you could maybe frame what percentage of the portfolio today is what you classify as affordable versus premium, how those cohorts are growing relative to the totality. And just the relationship between the 2, like would you still be pursuing the affordability opportunity as aggressively if you didn't have the premiumization lever working for you? Are those 2 things related in your mind? Or are they mutually exclusive? \nJames Quincey: Do you want to start? \nJohn Murphy: Yes. Let me take the first part, Steve. Just as you said, the first quarter, we did benefit from the equity income coming in better. And we also had a couple of onetimes on dividends, et cetera, that helped.\n For the rest of the year, no significant change in what we've guided on interest expense. You can expect Q2 and Q3 relative to prior year to be higher impact, given that we really saw the step-up starting in Q4 of last year. So we still, for the full year, expect the same quantum of deleverage as we had indicated in our February guidance. \nJames Quincey: Perhaps I'll take the RGM bit, Steve. I'm not sure I would attach a percentage to it globally. I'm not sure it drives relevance. I think a couple of thoughts, though.\n One, clearly, as over time, there has been an increase in disparity of income in any given country, the need to match the consumer across a broader range of price points has gone up. So you see both more opportunity and more need to have a foot in affordability and the other foot in premium. And so those -- both of the ends of the spectrum have been going up over time as we seek to meet the consumers where they are and where their pockets are and allow them to stay in our franchise.\n So I see it as a need to do more of both. Obviously, what's affordable and what's premium in the U.S. might look different than it does in Africa or China or Western Europe, but the direction of travel is more of both. And the mechanic of delivering on them, again, is different by countries.\n In Latin America, it might be with a refillable PET bottle to get down to affordability. In the U.S., it might be certain package sizes or the level of promos in some of the modern trade channels. Again, premium might look different. It might be returnable glass in Spain. And it might be different categories, for example, fairlife in the U.S. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. \nAndrea Teixeira: James, I appreciate your comment on the puts and takes, especially with the away from home and the easy comps for the QSR in the U.S. in the first quarter. We have been seeing some retailers talk about the weather and also seeing companies talk about weaker recent trends, in particular in the U.S. in March.\n I know to the extent you normally don't give us the exit rate, but particularly now as we see these puts and takes, and of course, your guidance doesn't really imply a continuation of the trends that you saw in the first quarter. So I think, obviously, this start is a pretty good start and give us some more confidence on the rest of the year, but perhaps talk about this intakes and the easy comps in Asia that you alluded to. \nJames Quincey: It's -- I mean, we're 2 weeks into the second quarter. So I think that -- I don't think there's anything particularly productive in it. I mean, they weren't out-of-the-park results in the first couple of weeks, but there was some worse weather in India and the U.S. and the shift of Eastern side. \n I don't think one can draw a lot from a couple of softer weeks in the first 2 weeks of April. The whole -- the performance through the quarter was good. There wasn't a major ski slope from January through to March. And so I think that we saw continued strength.\n I would encourage people as they look out for the rest of the year and think about momentum as I did last year to look at some of the multiyear trends. And last year, I encouraged people to look compared to 2019 on a 3-year CAGR basis because then that helps see through some of the reopenings and closings and all the [ strategies ].\n I would encourage the same thing this year in the sense of the 4-year CAGR to 2019 and see it that way. Look, there's a long way to go. We've started with strong momentum. We had it in January. We had it in March. The consumer is holding up, and we feel good about the strength of our strategy. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore. \nRobert Ottenstein: James, you've had some very interesting packaging innovation and digital engagement with younger consumers trying to keep them, bring them into the CSD portfolio. Just wondering if you could give us any kind of sense of how that's developing? Are you seeing improved brand equity scores with younger consumers, better market share? Any early signs that these innovations targeted to younger demographics, developed markets are working? \nJames Quincey: Sure. Yes, you put your finger on a kind of a nexus of a whole set of innovations. Let me just focus them in on the -- just using Coca-Cola brand, just to start with for a second. I mean, we did the Coke Creations, which was kind of limited edition kind of beyond it's vanilla or it's cherry into kind of stardust and marshmallow. And I think it was much more engaging for consumers.\n Some of the advertising, I mean, we did -- we partnered with OpenAI and ChatGPT and DALL-E to run a promotion where you could design Coke advertising and have it come up on the Times Square billboard. And all of that change, obviously, the bigger scale through the marketing, which has become much more digital over the last 3 years is starting to drive a difference.\n So if I were to take the U.S. where historically, we have been underrecruiting to not say, not recruiting consumers, we can see that the growth in the Coke franchise is not just being driven by increased recruitment, but increased engagement and recruitment of Gen Z. So you're starting to see an impact come through on the aggregate recruiting numbers, on the aggregate engagement with Gen Z and the increase of Gen Z coming into the franchise. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. \nNik Modi: James, I was hoping you can talk about the nonsparkling part of the business, less so from a consumer and product strategy side, but more from a go-to-market with this whole reorganization going on in North America, in particular, is there a better infrastructure do you think for Coke to sell the entire portfolio versus kind of historically how it's been much more kind of predominantly focused on sparkling? Any thoughts on that would be helpful. \nJames Quincey: So let me talk about the portfolio and then the go-to-market. I mean, clearly, the portfolio in North America has been expanding over the last decades, but a lot in the -- a lot recently as well. I think the results you're seeing in North America is actually driven by the overused expression of the [ AN ] strategy. We're seeing growth in soft drinks, good resonance in Coke and Coke Zero but also growth in the rest of the portfolio.\n We talked about in the script how fairlife has been on a multiyear journey, really, really doing well. Obviously, that builds on some of the previous acquisitions. vitaminwater and smartwater doing really well in the quarter. And so you're starting to see the portfolio being built out across the different categories.\n Clearly, it's not all plain sailing in every category. We've talked how we need to stabilize and reinvigorate BODYARMOR in tandem with POWERADE. You're starting to see some growth in the coffee ready-to-drink in North America.\n Now all of that feeds into a set of routes to the market, which are -- there are multiple platforms in the U.S. There have been. Clearly, the biggest piece is the bottlers largely to, obviously, retailers and lots of away-from-home channels, complemented by the chilled route and the fountain route.\n So I think there's much greater focus on getting the portfolio, be the portfolio that works for consumers and drives a winning strategy for the retailers. And then a vastly strengthened bottling system over the last number of years through the refranchising through great work by the bottlers in the U.S. to both increase their capability and increase their rate of investment. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. \nPeter Grom: James, I was hoping to follow up on that a little bit and just kind of get some perspective on the current trends in the sports drink category, specifically here in the U.S. I think you called out BODYARMOR and POWERADE being under some pressure in the release, and you just alluded to that in your response to the next question. So can you maybe just talk about the competitive dynamics in that category and kind of how you see that evolving as we look out over the balance of the year? \nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. Obviously, we've got 2 brands. We've got BODYARMOR and POWERADE. We talked on previous calls where we had not had the greatest integration into the Coke system last year on BODYARMOR. And obviously, there's some new players and new category dynamics.\n We're very focused on stabilizing our portfolio and growing from here. We brought out some product innovation in the first quarter with BODYARMOR Flash I.V. The BODYARMOR Sports water continued to be the fastest-growing premium water and POWERADE Zero sugar.\n So we -- we're starting to see some innovation coming through, some better marketing. There will be some missing package formats going into the marketplace in Q2 with multi-serve multipack versions of BODYARMOR. And so we think we can do well as we've talked about before with BODYARMOR and POWERADE. It's early days, but we see some promising signs to reverting the trend by the end of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities. \nWilliam Chappell: Just a follow up on the still and kind of elasticity. I mean, it seems like sparkling, you have plenty of pricing opportunity from here, but maybe also on juice, water kind of base level, do you see promotions coming back in? Do you see like -- you feel like you're running into a ceiling at some point this year in terms of pricing because especially as you're getting more of a middle and lower-end consumer that's buying some of those products? Any thoughts there would be great. \nJames Quincey: Yes. Look, I think in recent times, the elasticities on water have been stronger than they have on soft drinks and juice somewhere in there as well. And so that clearly consumers are being differentiating by category and brand strength and whether the brand or the category has earned the right to do the pricing even if the pricing is largely cost-driven. So that definitely has been a feature of recent quarters.\n As we look out, as I said, we see pricing moderating, which means in the context of markets like the U.S. or Europe is a reduction in the level of off-cycle price increases. We may, as we go forward, see slightly more promotions as we look for those consumers who are under pressure to offer them slightly better affordability options.\n But we'll be balancing that with investments in premiumization options, whether that be categories or packaging. And so as I talked about in the answer on one of the other questions, we're trying to work both ends of the spectrum here. And I see the need to press harder on both ends as we have done over the last number of years and as we will do in the course of this year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. \nKevin Grundy: Great. We covered a lot of ground. So a couple of cleanups for me, probably both for John. Can you quantify the impact from hyperinflationary pricing in the quarter from Turkey and Argentina? I'm not sure if that's a number that you have at your fingertips.\n And then broadly, investment levels, I think there'd be a view in staples broadly that as gross margin improves, it will lend itself to some degree of reinvestment. Just wanted to get your thoughts on where the organization is now in terms of its satisfaction with overall investment levels.\n I think pre-pandemic, we're sort of at a high 12%. Industry dipped collectively for all the reasons that we know. If I'm not mistaken, you guys are around 8.5% of sales. Where do you see that going? And then maybe just some broader thoughts on adequacy and how you see this progressing as the cost environment lends itself to a greater degree of reinvestment. \nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Kevin. First question on the hyperinflationary, but just a little under 2 points in Q1. I don't have the mirror for the crystal ball for the rest of the year, but you can build that into your assumptions for the rest of the year.\n Regarding investment levels, we've been, I think, very consistent over the last 3 or 4 years and been clear that we will invest as we need to support the portfolio. And on a quarter-to-quarter basis, there are ups and downs on that.\n We did some really good work in '21, '22 to be able to do more with less or to do more with the same. So it's not apples-to-apples in that sense. I think we're getting more value today per dollar of investments than we have ever done before.\n And so when I take that into account plus the absolute levels that we're investing, I think we are in good shape overall. And I think our markets have what they need. And so we continue to be very much of the mindset to have that as a top priority and where necessary and Q1 is a good example, in some cases, to invest ahead of the curve. So all in, I feel good about the rate and the improving effectiveness of our overall spend. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. \nChristopher Carey: Just a couple of cleanups for me as well. Just, John, on a total inflation basis, did you see commodities get a little bit worse through the quarter? And perhaps, can you comment on total inflation, including freight? So just trying to frame the commodity inflation versus total inflation?\n And then from a cash flow standpoint, would you expect free cash flow to be positive in Q2? And any way that you would just discuss the front half versus back half delivery in the context of your full year free cash flow guidance? \nJohn Murphy: Yes, our commodities portfolio, so to speak, is it's going to -- it's a mixed bag in there. On the one hand, we're seeing some moderation in the number of commodities, metals number, for example. We're seeing moderation on ocean and freight in general. But offsetting that for us was we have a pretty meaningful increase in sweeteners and in juices. So that's one consideration.\n The second consideration is we continue to hedge in 2023, and we feel good about the hedges we're putting into place. But they are cycling a set of hedges in 2022 that were more favorable. So I think it's important to keep that in mind.\n And then thirdly, as we go into the rest of the year, as we've alluded to in some of the other questions, we do see some further moderation on the overall cost front. But we do have, as a net of all of that, continued view that we'll have a mid-single-digit increase for the year 2023.\n And on free cash flow, yes, the first -- as we said, the first quarter, we had a couple of discrete items in there that we had highlighted in February. And we've also had a couple of timing items, working capital-related that has affected the net results for the quarter.\n Keep in mind that in the second quarter, we will have the transition tax payments going out. And so for this year, I would expect free cash flow as a result of what's happened in Q1 and what I expect in Q2 to be back weighted towards the second half of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlos Laboy from HSBC. \nCarlos Alberto Laboy: To expand on Steve's earlier question, in the emerging markets, refillables, they drive affordability, but it seems they also help you to increase premium pricing for one way and create premium growth. So my question is, where in emerging markets might you see big opportunities or new opportunities to drive affordability gains and revenue management? \nJames Quincey: Yes. Carlos, thanks. Definitely agree with you on the essential idea that if you have a good anchor in affordability options, it allows the portfolio to stretch along the price spectrum with other packaging options and thereby, both satisfying more consumers and drive a more -- a better -- a higher competitive advantage and a more profitable business overall.\n Obviously, the refillables infrastructure takes time to build, not just from a kind of a manufacturing and distribution point of view, but from a retail and consumer habit point of view. But there's still plenty of opportunity in Latin America, which is obviously one of the big bases. It's still a feature of the German market.\n How far that then becomes a feature of other markets is going to be developed over time. We've certainly got some activity in Africa and India, but it doesn't -- as you know, it doesn't change rapidly overnight, but there's definitely big opportunities to use all the thinking behind RGM and all the new and latest technologies to provide packaging options that give price points across this broader range as possible. \nOperator: Our last question will come from Charlie Higgs from Redburn. \nCharlie Higgs: Just a final one on innovation, please. And I think you've relaunched Sprite Zero in the quarter and also POWERADE. Is there any initial feedback you could give on those brands? That'd be very useful. And then also just any thoughts on Coke Zero, which, again, it grew volumes 8% of a comp of 14%. I guess just how much further do you think that brand specifically has to go? \nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean, the reformulations on Sprite Zero and POWERADE are specific to a number of markets. It's not a big call out. They're part of an ongoing program to make sure that we have the best tasting, most effective recipes in any particular market. So I see those as examples of continuing to innovate to stay on the cutting edge of the formula, whether that's taste and enjoyment or delivery on a functional feature in a category like the sports category.\n And as it relates to Coke Zero, we now have many years of very strong volume growth behind Coke Zero. I think there's a huge and massive ongoing runway for Coke Zero to continue to grow. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks. \nJames Quincey: So just to summarize, the year's off to a great start. We continue to win in the marketplace. While it's still early in the year and the macro environment remains uncertain, we're confident in our plans and our ability to leverage our capabilities to adapt to consumer needs and drive top line-led growth. And we have visibility to deliver on our 2023 guidance.\n We're focused on the sizable opportunity ahead of us and are managing the near-term uncertainties to build a Coke system for the long term. Thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning. Thank you. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors and, therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed.

Following prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question. Reenter the queue to ask any follow-ups. Now, I will turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Robin, and good morning, everyone. After a good first half of 2024, we navigated through a dynamic external landscape during the third quarter. Our business again proved to be resilient. Volume declined 1% in the quarter driven by a slow start in July. However, our business trends improved each month and, notably, Trademark Coca-Cola volume outperformed during the quarter. Our year-to-date 2024 performance gives us confidence we will deliver at the high end of our previous top line guidance and earnings growth of 5% to 6%, including approximately 9% of currency headwinds. With that as context, I'll start with an update on the global consumer landscape and a review of the third quarter business performance. Then I'll explain how we're delivering on our objectives by staying agile and improving execution of our strategy across each facet of our growth flywheel. John will end by discussing financial details for the quarter, our updated guidance for full year 2024, and some early considerations for 2025. During the quarter, global consumer sentiment and spending in aggregate held up well, and our broader industry continued to expand. In this context, we delivered robust organic revenue growth with value share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels. We also expanded comparable margins. This led to 5% comparable earnings per share growth despite nearly double-digit currency headwinds and the impact of bottler refranchising. We continue to demonstrate staying power as the beverage industry remains attractive with many strong new and existing players. Our system is well positioned to develop the commercial beverage industry in many markets and capture long-term balanced growth. Across the world, we are leveraging our scale and local expertise to navigate varying local market dynamics. In North America, we generated robust top line growth and won value share. Trademark Coca-Cola and sparkling flavors both grew volume. During the quarter and year-to-date, Trademark Coca-Cola and fairlife were the leaders in the beverage industry in at-home retail sales growth. Consumers are responding well to sharper value messaging in away-from-home channels, and we're continuing to drive affordable and premium packages across our total beverage portfolio to realize positive mix. In Latin America, volume was flat during the quarter as we cycled strong growth in the prior year. We had solid revenue growth led by Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Powerade. We also benefited from integrating marketing activations across the region. For example, in Brazil, Rock in Rio reached over 70 million people and led to Trademark Coca-Cola being the most mentioned brand on TikTok. Stepped-up execution by increasing cooler placement and investing in digital capabilities is also driving results. In EMEA, we saw improved performance in Europe and strong growth across many parts of Africa. The performance in Eurasia and Middle East and North Africa unfavorably impacted overall results. In Europe, we grew volume during the quarter and benefited from the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Both Fuze Tea and Powerade continued their strong momentum. And we're continuing to focus on affordable price points, value packages, tailored promotions and premium offerings to drive demand. In Eurasia and Middle East, a confluence of headwinds led to a decline in volume. While it's fair to assume pressure will persist in the near-term, we are taking action. Our system is driving affordability and availability, and we're leaning into the local intrinsics of our business. In Africa, volume declined largely due to pressure in some North African markets. Outside of these markets, we grew volume and gained value share. Our system is investing for the long-term by accelerating refillable offerings, cooler placements and increasing manufacturing capacity. Lastly, in Asia Pacific, despite weakness in China and a couple of markets in Southeast Asia, we grew organic revenue and comparable operating income. In ASEAN and South Pacific, we gained value share led by the Philippines and Australia. The Philippines grew affordable transactions with refillable packages and grew premium transactions with single-serve offerings. Australia prioritized affordability initiatives across our sparkling portfolio and successfully activated the Olympic Games with Powerade. In Japan and South Korea, we had solid volume growth and won value share due to good traction on brand relaunches, which leveraged enhanced taste and refreshed packaging and stepped-up performance in e-commerce channels. In China, a challenging operating environment and strategic reprioritization of our portfolio led to a decline in volume. We're continuing to focus on driving affordability across our core portfolio. Our longer-term growth ambition is unchanged, and we're investing to come out ahead when conditions improve. In India, volume declined in states impacted by higher than normal monsoons. In geographic areas that were unaffected, volume grew mid-single-digits. We remain upbeat about progress in integrated execution and our ability to capture long-term growth opportunities. To sum everything up, while our markets continue to move in many different directions and our agility is being put to the test, our all-weather strategy is working. We're continuing to deliver on our strategy through a combination of world-class marketing and innovation and excellence in revenue growth management and execution. Starting with marketing and innovation. Our refreshed marketing model is integrating digital, live and retail experiences to connect with consumers in unique and personalized ways. The Olympic and Paralympic games, is a great example. We featured our total beverage portfolio, launched fan zones and festivals, and leveraged social channels to increase connections with athletes. Many of our brands offered customized packaging, and our system activated tailored point-of-sale displays with customers around the world. The Olympic and Paralympic Games were activated with customers across over 65 markets, featured nearly 250 influencers, and demonstrated positive engagement scores across our portfolio. Topo Chico is another example. In the U.S., Topo Chico is the number one premium sparkling water brand. We've driven strong consumer demand with a grassroots experiential campaign in 13 cities featuring impactful displays connecting Topo Chico to food, music and art. In Mexico, we're applying a similar playbook. We recently launched Topo Chico's first-ever nationwide experiential activation with the Think Like An Artist campaign. This featured connections with local artists across 69 events in five cities and was amplified through social channels. During the quarter, Topo Chico trademark grew volume nearly 20% globally. Year-to-date volume has increased tenfold compared to pre-acquisition levels in 2016. Our marketing and innovation agenda emphasizes a culture of acting boldly, learning and not being afraid to fail, and scaling successes. Sometimes our innovations don't hit the mark as evidenced by Coca-Cola Spice, which we've discontinued. But our focus on bigger and bolder innovations is paying off. Fuze Tea is a multiyear success and is scaling well across over 80 markets, and Minute Maid Zero Sugars showing promise. Sprite Chill also delivered over $50 million in retail sales after only 21 weeks in the market and has been extended after a successful limited run. We also innovate for different reasons. It can be to generate short-term buzz, such as the third quarter launch of the limited edition product, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Oreo, which is available in over 35 markets, and Fanta Beetlejuice, which is our first-ever global Halloween activation and is offered in nearly 50 markets. Or we might invest for the long term such as our announcement of plans to debut Bacardi Mix with Coca-Cola in 2025. So far, in 2024, overall, we've benefited from strong velocities on our innovation and we're continuing to improve our innovation success rates versus prior year. Moving across our flywheel. Our system is step-changing execution by fully integrating our marketing and commercial plans and investing to grow our customers' businesses. Leveraging data and digitally-enabled solutions, including AI, is a huge opportunity. And we are integrating digital advertising with point-of-sale messaging and offering brand price pack architecture geared to customers' individual needs. When executed efficiently, this approach can deliver promising uplifts in retail sales for our customers. While we're focused on taking our capabilities to the next level, we're also working towards mastering the foundations that move the needle. In 2024, our system increased availability by investing in cold drink equipment and boosted our share of visible cold inventory across markets. In the past 12 months, we created $11 billion in incremental retail sales for customers, which is more than double the next five closest beverage companies combined. From 2018 to 2023, we were the leader in customer value creation for the beverage industry every year. To summarize, we feel good about the momentum of our business. And as we look ahead, our external environment will continue to have many moving pieces. We'll continue to prioritize flexibility to navigate market dynamics locally to deliver on our global objectives. Thanks to the power of our portfolio, our system's unique capabilities and the unwavering dedication of our system employees, we're confident we will be able to deliver on our 2024 guidance and longer-term priorities. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll comment on our third quarter performance, discuss the outlook for the remainder of 2024, and provide some early commentary on 2025. During the third quarter, we grew organic revenues 9%. Unit cases declined 1% having had a poor July, but improving sequentially thereafter during the quarter. Concentrate sales were 1 point behind unit cases for the quarter, driven primarily by the timing of concentrate shipments. Our price/mix growth of 10% was driven by two items. Approximately 7 points of pricing split somewhat evenly between normal pricing actions across our markets and intense inflationary pricing in a handful of markets experiencing currency devaluations, and approximately 3 points of mix across the markets, which was primarily driven by stronger growth in several developed markets versus developing and emerging markets. Excluding the impact from intense inflationary pricing, organic revenue growth during the quarter continued to be at the high end of our long-term growth algorithm. Comparable gross margin was up approximately 70 basis points and comparable operating margin was up approximately 100 basis points. Both were driven by underlying expansion and the benefit from butter refranchising, partially offset by the impact of currency headwinds. Putting it all together, third quarter comparable EPS of $0.77 was up 5% year-over-year despite higher-than-expected 9% currency headwinds and 2% headwinds from bottler refranchising. During the quarter, we made a $6 billion deposit with the IRS related to our ongoing tax dispute. We've also filed our appeal with the 11th Circuit Court. We're pleased to move forward with the process. We will vigorously defend our position. We believe we will prevail, and we will continue to keep you updated. Free cash flow, excluding the IRS tax litigation deposit, was approximately $7.6 billion, which is down approximately $290 million versus the prior year due to higher other tax payments, higher capital expenditures and cycling some working capital benefits from the prior year. Our balance sheet is strong, and our net debt leverage of 1.7 times EBITDA is below our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x. If you include our latest estimate of $6.1 billion related to our fairlife contingent consideration payment, which we expect to make in the first half of 2025, our expected net debt leverage would be at the low end of our target range. As James mentioned, our powerful portfolio, amplified by our system's unique capabilities gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our updated 2024 guidance. We now expect organic revenue growth of approximately 10% and comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 14% to 15%. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we now anticipate an approximate 5-point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 9-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2024. We continue to expect comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus $2.69 in 2023. While it is too early to provide specific guidance on 2025, we do want to share some considerations based on what we know today. We're encouraged by our underlying performance and believe we're well positioned to deliver on our long-term growth opportunity. We expect pricing from intense inflationary markets to moderate in 2025 and recycling the impact of currency devaluations from these markets in 2024. With respect to our commodity environment, we expect prices on industrial materials to remain relatively stable, while agricultural commodities will continue to face volatility and higher prices. We will continue to invest behind our brands as we have been doing, while at the same time we will leverage a range of productivity levers to drive efficiency and effectiveness across our P&L. We expect elevated net interest expense resulting from the deposit made related to the ongoing IRS tax dispute and upcoming fairlife contingent consideration payment. Regarding currency, if we assume current rates on our hedge positions, there would be an approximate low single-digit currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate mid-single-digit currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2025. Many factors could impact both our currency outlook and broader business between now and when we expect to provide guidance in February. With our all-weather strategy, we've delivered comparable earnings growth for many years now. We have numerous levers to continue to do so. So in summary, successfully executing our strategy in an ever-evolving operating environment, we're confident in our ability to deliver on our objectives in 2024 and over the long-term. We're clear on the direction we are heading in the system. And we continue to invest with our bottling partners to drive sustainable long-term growth. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSteve Powers: Thanks very much. Good morning. So James, it sounds like momentum sequentially improved through the third quarter from a unit case perspective, which is welcome news. I guess given that as you look forward, how confident are you that you can return trends to positive growth in the fourth quarter? And how much of any expected improvement trajectory is within your control through some of the initiatives you detailed in the prepared remarks versus the system being essentially more dependent on a less -- just a less adverse macro backdrop? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Steve. Clearly, we were not as happy as we could have been in the third quarter with volume, and we focused on adapting quickly and saw improvements through the quarter. So July was the bump and things improved in August through September. I largely believe that it's within our control to return to growth. Actually, the macro environment, I'm sure we'll touch on later, is showing a degree of resilience. There are lots of puts and takes, but a degree of resilience. So I think it's firmly about getting our flywheel of the marketing innovation, the price pack and the execution of the system, and that we can get back to growth, which is very much implicit in our algorithm and our expectations going forward through the fourth quarter into 2025.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to focus on the mix component within price mix. You mentioned it was 3% in the quarter. Great result. How sustainable is that as you look going forward out to 2025? And maybe can you talk about some of the key efforts on that front?\nJames Quincey: Yes. Let me break the mix -- I mean, mix has got a lot of different components in it country, category, channel, affordability or premiumization. In the third quarter, there are a couple of pieces of mix that I wanted to call out. One, which I see is enduring and ongoing and one which I see as more temporary. The enduring and ongoing piece is, of course, we're focused on not just driving the growth of affordability options, whether they be smaller packages, smaller multipacks at better entry price points or refillables depending on where you are in the world as a key part of responding to those consumers that are under disposable income pressure, which tends to be a headwind, but also focusing on premium segments whether that be premium waters or fairlife or some of the Coke SKUs to get the mix to be up. And so the more enduring piece is that ongoing management of affordability and premiumizations to drive our mix. The bit that was more temporary, which is relatively atypical in the last number of years, remember that the average price in emerging markets is lower than average price in the developed economies. Typically speaking, the emerging markets grow faster, so mechanically they are a headwind in price mix because they obviously have a lower price. In this quarter, atypically, the emerging markets have grown slower or have declined relative to the major economies, U.S., Europe, Japan, Australia. And so that actually has a kind of automatic stabilizer effect, which is that it makes price/mix go up. And of course, we're expecting, as we go through the fourth quarter into next year, to go to a more normal construct where we'll see decent results in the developed economies and faster growth in the emerging markets, and that will then have a normal shape -- more normal shape to its volume and a more normal shape to its price mix. So I think we feel good about where this is likely to go.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. I would love to hear a bit more about those adapted-quickly items, James, that you kind of spoke to. So believing in our control, there's a lot there, right? So I just would love if we could get some more maybe tangible examples of what you're doing to adapt quickly that is having -- you're able to execute quickly and have a quick payback. And since you teased the macro, let's get your view on the macro environment as well. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean I don't think my view on the macro environment is going to take us too far. It's basically two big thoughts. One, at a global level, the consumer and the economies, I mean, the IMF report came out yesterday, is relatively resilient and relatively stable on a global basis. Clearly, there are a set of puts and takes between geographies, between income levels. But the macros in aggregate are a sum of a shifting set of puts and takes, but resilience in aggregate. Exactly how that will turn out, I'm not sure next year, probably different puts and takes, but again, resilience on overall basis. In terms of the tangible examples, I mean, it's a question where affordability, like, are we pressing hard on making the availability of certain affordable options even more expansive? Have we brought -- bringing forward, for example, investments in cold drink equipment so that we can upscale the availability of cold product, remembering, for example, that the Southern Hemisphere is just about to go into its summer, can we get further faster in terms of doing that, which will then tend to drive more volume growth. Are we applying the right adjustment to the mix of the marketing messaging? And how do we tweak that now that we have a more agile marketing model with the ongoing transformation, we're able to adapt the messaging. So to really get in there and get those things. And then in some parts of the world, it's about adapting the messaging to the situation. I mean some countries, for example, where the economics are very poor, it's not so much about the marketing, it's more about the availability and the entry price points. So we've always got to work with our local bottlers to drive what's the right system answer and really fine-tune our relevance with the consumers the retailers in that country in this moment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks operator. Good morning, James. Good morning, John. I guess a question about North America. And our observation through this quarter or over the summer was just, I guess, a little bit of softness overall in just discretionary spending, so that kind of expressed in small-format stores, convenience and gas, I think also maybe a bit in foodservice. So can you just maybe talk to that? Are you seeing the same thing? And is there maybe just a little bit of a recession, if you will, on impulse purchases right now? And if so, just what do you think changes that?\nJames Quincey: I think it's -- honestly, I think it's more of a mix. There's clearly part of the consumer landscape where there's pressure on disposable income. If you look -- I mean it depends whether you want to take measures of consumer confidence or measures of consumer sentiment. I know that sounds like the same thing, but depending which source you look at, one's going up, one is going down. So there's a mixed bag. I would say there is some softness in aggregate, but it's very marginal in the total industry landscape. The beverage industry is still pretty robust. There's growth in total dollars. Having said that, we talked about in previous quarters there's a set of consumers exhibiting value-seeking behavior, whether they're looking for combo deals when they're in away from home, particularly quick-service restaurants, whether they're looking for going and getting lower price point purchases of beverages, whether that's a smaller pack size or a smaller number of packs in multipack, that's out there. But there's just a -- also strong purchasing power in other segments of the marketplace, which is somewhat offsetting. I mean, witnessed the strong momentum, for example, in fairlife. But net-net, I think the U.S. marketplace has remained pretty resilient given what is -- given the China -- trajectory macroeconomically speaking that we come through.\nOperator: Next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChris Carey: Hi good morning everyone. Yes, this has been somewhat addressed, but I think I'd maybe be a little bit more specific. The stock is off a bit premarket on what appears to be around 2025 earnings growth given your outlook for FX and net interest expense going into next year. And I think the lesson from this year and really in recent years, has been your ability to overcome these substantial effect headwinds and other headwinds and still deliver on reported EPS growth. James, John, you both expressed some confidence in the prepared remarks on innovation, delivering against longer-term targets. So I guess, can you just touch on maybe some of the lessons of 2024 areas which really allowed you to overcome what was the substantial FX, it still is, headwind this year and still deliver your reported earnings objective, whether pricing RGM innovation, whatever that may be, and what feels durable going into next year? I know you've touched on it, but just trying to get down to what's really driving the stock today. And then maybe importantly, then I'm done, but just the areas where you have a bit more of a heightened focus or a sense things, maybe slowing in Mexico, India, some of these lingering turbulent issues in the Middle East, anything that comes to mind? So basically, just you've got momentum into confronting these headwinds next year, but the environment is also evolving. And I'd just maybe like to put a little bit of a finer bow on that. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure, Chris. I think you're going to win this year's prize for the longest question.\nChris Carey: I expected that.\nJames Quincey: Look, let me start and then I'll -- John will probably want to weigh in too. We have for a number of years and very deliberately chose the expression, the all-weather strategy because as we have all lived, we've been through a lot of very atypical years in the last 5, 7 years. And we wanted to make the point by calling an all-weather strategy, look, we cannot predict like what's going to happen next year. We know some elements, and John will talk about them, but there are many other things that are going to happen. But we're going to pull the levers to get there and drive the business forward, trying to deliver on top line at the end of the top of the algorithm and underlying EPS growth. A couple of things that I think are worth noting about 2024 and its implications into '25. There's a difference, particularly if we talk -- I mean, firstly, FX, as you said, the mid-single-digit call for next year is less than it is this year, although obviously interest is high. There's a difference in FX, if it's coming from the, let's call them, the G10 economies, which are, let's call -- name Europe because it's the simplest example. If there's a big devaluation of the euro, there's not likely to be a lot of pass-through inflation in the short term in the European marketplace, and that's going to be much harder for us to deal with, but not impossible. If there's a big devaluation in an emerging market, you tend to get more immediate pass-through of the inflation. And so you can see that in 2024. In 2024, almost all the FX headwind is a consequence of devaluations in the emerging markets. And actually, the G10 bucket is broadly flat, I believe. And so that you do have -- if it's coming from the emerging markets, there's a little more of a link back to above-normal pricing on the top line, which, again, you see in the year-to-date in 2024. So, there's a piece of next year where we, and John will get into it, where you've got to some extent see G10 is different to the to the emerging markets, and some of the emerging markets stuff is linked to the top line. And then obviously, within that, we have to manage each of the marketplace. Because if there's high inflation, there's likely to be a big push on affordability and a big shift in the marketing and innovation mix. So, there's a set of kind of framework approaches depending on what sort of our problem is occurring in the marketplace. But again, let me finish my thought and then hand over. In the end, we're pursuing all-weather strategy. Some years the headwinds will be greater than others, but we're going to pursue a strategy to get over the line in terms of trying to drive some growth. And there's a lot that can still happen before next year and will come with a complete picture in February. John, do you want to add?\nJohn Murphy: Maybe, Chris, if I could touch upon some of the lessons that we've learned, not just this year but really over the last few years. First one I'd say is it's really important through the thick and thin of all of this is to stay very focused on investing the right way behind our brands and that is something we will continue to do. I think, secondly, in the last couple of years, having an even sharper understanding as to where your profit drivers are underneath the global portfolio at the country casualty level and then making sure that we're over-allocating resources to support those larger profit pools both in the base of the business and as we think about growth going forward is really important. And doing that in partnership with our bottlers around the world and we've seen that being a big source of the momentum over the last couple of years. I think the third area that I would highlight and I know it's a topic across many companies going into 2025, is that you can never take your foot off the productivity accelerator. And in that context, I think the learning is that that you've got to build into your overall way of doing business as opposed to have it as an end-of-year project that you need to kind of deliver something in the next six to 12 weeks to save the quarter. So, we've got a lot of levers we've talked about it in the past that are available to us, whether it's through marketing investment line, our operating investment line, operating expense investment line, or through our supply chain. And we will continue to go after the opportunities that come at us. And so when you take all of those together, I think that's what we see creating that flywheel of growth on the top line, and then the ability to sustain and expand margins down through the P&L from there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBonnie Herzog: Hi, thank you. Good morning. I actually wanted to circle back to North America. Your organic sales growth was very strong at 12%, which caught most of us by surprise. And growth was primarily driven by the double-digit price mix. So, hoping for a little bit more color behind that in terms of rate versus mix in the market. And then ultimately, how sustainable that is and I guess, second, I'd be curious to hear if you believe you've maybe reached a point where you've pushed too far in terms of pricing. And if so, how will you modify your pricing strategy or RGM capabilities going forward. James, you did touch on this, certainly a greater focus on affordability, so maybe an example or two would be helpful to hear. Thanks so much.\nJames Quincey: Sure, Bonnie. Firstly, in North America, Q3, the price/mix, half, in round numbers, half of it is price and half of it is mix. So price closer to rate. The mix is being driven by some of the de-price -- some of the kind of lesser focus on case pack water, but a heavy investments behind brands like fairlife, Topo Chico, some of the nutrition staff, Coca-Cola. And those tend to be mix positive. So there's clearly a consequence, actually John just talked about it, really being choiceful about where we invest behind which brands, in which countries, in which channels. And that's coming through in North America, which is why you got about half of that coming from mix and half of it coming from price or right. Clearly, there's a balance there with some of the affordability actions we're doing, but that's the basic setup. And if we just home in on price for a second, so you're getting roughly half of that in price, and that then starts to look a lot like the trajectory of CPI that has been coming down. And what we see going forward is there'll continue to be inflation in the input costs whether that be labor, particularly some of the agricultural commodities, some of the packaging costs as well, are still going to be increasing in cost, although at a lower rate. So again, we see us heading towards a more normalized level of pricing going into next year and kind of landing in a more normal zone as kind of -- some of that tracks down at kind of similar rates to CPI. Of course, we continue to be very choiceful about where we invest for affordability options and where we invest for premiumization options. I'm not sure, I think mix will always be four or five points. But certainly, we would look for continued growth in the North American business.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nFilippo Falorni: Hi, good morning everyone. I wanted to ask on the margin outlook going forward. This year, you realized very strong gross margin, operating margin expansion, a lot of it driven by the refranchising activity with the underlying kind of being offset by currency. As we think about going forward, you guys both talked about leverage on the productivity line, maybe some inflation in the agricultural commodities, can you talk us through like the balance of the levers for margin expansion into next year? And anything we should be thinking about, assuming no other franchising activity? Thank you.\nJohn Murphy: Sure. Thanks for the question. First of all, it's a huge area of focus and has been. We're currently tracking to have our highest gross margin level since pre-COVID and expect that underlying expansion to continue, notwithstanding, the offsets that you just mentioned. For 2025, as we as we laid out in the script, some of the considerations for 2025 is a more normalized pricing environment. James has touched upon that. We would continue to look to offset the FX headwinds with some underlying expansion through our RGM and cost efficiency efforts. I've highlighted some of the challenges we have on the agricultural commodity front, and we see that being part of just the equation we need to manage. We are, as I said earlier, looking at a number of levers on both the revenue and the cost lines, our ongoing elevation on the RGM front, the optimization of \u2013 on the promotional front within the innovation space, things like simplification of product specs, for example, can free up a lot of dollars. The way we have been working with our very diverse supplier base across the world, not only for certainty of supply, which is a huge priority in a number of markets, but over time to leverage the scale of the system, et cetera. So there's just a lot of opportunity and it's not any one big thing that's going to make or break the numbers. But I think it's our continued ability to bring all of these levers to play that's going to make the difference. And I think that's represented in the consideration set that we framed for 2025.\nFilippo Falorni: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you and good morning, everyone. James, John, you mentioned that volumes improved as you exit the quarter, but implied organic sales growth for Q4 even after you raised, it's closer to, I believe, 6% from 9% in Q3, if my math is correct, and you have the extra two days. I'm hoping to see if you can help us bridge the most recent trends and how to think about Q4. And separately, just a clarification. There are some recent news on potential ban in the sale of CSDs and snacks in schools Mexico. I know that historically the impact of the sugar tax was not relevant at all. But just wanted to hear how you're positioning cases if it materializes? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Let me go in reverse order. I haven't read all the news in Mexico, I'm not sure it's happening yet. But we largely sell a no-sugar set of portfolios recommendation towards schools and that's part of our global approach. So I'm not sure how that matters, or not sure how that's going to impact the business. I'd imagine that's going to be very small, if at all. In terms of Q4, I mean, I would unpack it and say, look, part of what is important here is what is going to be the flow-through from some of these high inflation marketplaces. If you take the impact of high inflation, it's clearly been slowing down or lesser impact as we've gone through the year. And so you're going to see potentially less impact in the fourth quarter from that. In terms of where we're going, in terms of CSDs, yes, clearly, there's going to be a pickup in terms of price -- in terms of inventory, sorry. And I don't think you quite got to the right number yet. I think it's probably implicitly a little higher. But we can certainly follow-up on that one. I think it's going to be a strong outlook. Because at the end of the day, in my simple way of thinking about things, if you take out all the moving pieces in the craziness of what goes on, at the end of the day, if I take out the high-inflation markets out of the price/mix in Q3, you get 6%. Volume was minus 1%, that's 5%. That's right in the range of top end of our growth algorithm, the same as it has been each quarter so far this year and in previous years. And if you just want to look at it in simple terms, excluding high inflation, I'm expecting us to say bang at the top end of our long-term growth algorithm.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKaumil Gajrawala: I'm going to go for the award for the shortest question. Since the news is so new with McDonald's and potential food contamination. I think they're your largest customer. Is there anything we should know about how it would impact your business?\nJames Quincey: Kaumil, yes, I think you've got a pretty short question there. Look, I think obviously, hearts go out to the people who have been affected by the contamination. Certainly, we're a big partner of McDonald's, they're a big partner of ours. We'll be helping them in any way we can as they work through whatever is happening here. Clearly, the information is very thin on the ground as it relates to those of us further away from the situation. Certainly, when one looks at what's in the media so far in terms of the states that have been affected, I would say, at this stage, it's not going to be a large, significant impact the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. Your CSD business in the U.S. is performing quite a bit better than it has than a number of years ago. And I'd like to kind of get your sense of the drivers on that? Is it Zero Sugar products? Is it better engagement with younger drinkers? It market share gains? And then more specifically, this year, some of the data that that we're looking at seems to suggest CSDs are retaking market share from energy drinks. So lots of pieces there, but I'd love to get your assessment of what's going on. Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Thanks Rob. Well, firstly, I'm tempted to go what's driving the growth of the soft drinks as all of the above, in terms of what we've been doing to make our brands more relevant. I think the North America teams have done a good job across the portfolio, to be fair. I mean if you look at the third quarter. Coke Trademark grew volumetrically speaking. The other sparkling beverages grew volumetrically speaking. I mean, within the Coke Trademark, Coke Original was broadly flat, and Coke Zero was double-digit growth, and even Diet Coke grew. So I think there's been a strong leveraging of the ongoing marketing transformation, paired with an improving set of execution by the bottling system, work on the RGM and the pack mix, and execution in the marketplace, that are bringing greater strength to the sparkling beverage business in North America. It's certainly been the accumulation of many quarters work and it's starting to show through both when you look at the third quarter and also if you were to look at -- if that's an improving trend through the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Charlie Higgs from Redburn. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nCharlie Higgs: Yes. Hi, James, John, Robin, hope you are all well. I'd like to dig into the unit case volumes down 1% in Q3 a bit more, please. And if you could maybe just quantify or contextualize some of the consumer hesitancy that's happened in Q3. Was it about the same as Q2 better or worse? And then also some of the impacts from the portfolio trimming you're doing. I'm just trying to get a sense of like the clean volume performance in Q3. And then just building on that, maybe you could touch a bit more on Trademark Coke, Coke Zero accelerating to 11%? Are you confident, James, that that's incremental and not coming from Coke Classic? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: We can break down the volume in lots of different ways. The first and most important piece of the puzzle, I sort of mentioned it earlier, is the relatively atypical makeup of volume in Q3. In other words, there was actually good performance from volume -- in volume terms across the developed economies. So North America, although it was flat, it had growth in the sparkling beverages and it had growth in the kind of the premium stills, if you like, across multiple categories, and we had deprioritized some of the case pack water. So actually North America had a good performance. Europe grew, Japan grew, Australia. And they grow -- not only did they grow, it -- the pressure had actually come from emerging markets. And that pressure in the emerging markets was concentrated in a set of markets, some with temporal factors and some with some ongoing issues. The temporal factors are more -- for example, Mexico was cycling in this quarter a very strong Q3 last year. Brazil continues to be good, but Mexico was cycling strong Q3 last year, which made Latin America looked like it came off. But actually, we still think the momentum is good there. India had a particularly heavy monsoon in a number of states, and that affected the volume in India. Actually, by the way, heavy monsoons tend to be a good predictor of agricultural yield, which would be then better next year. That's clearly going to be a temporary factor and we'd be looking for India to return to growth. Parts of the world that are on the more ongoing pressure are particularly China and the Eurasian markets or Eurasia and the Middle East. Clearly, here, we still see a couple of things going on. One, in China, yes, the economy is kind of not taking off. But some of what's going on with choices we've made. We chose to deprioritize some of water, in equivalent terms, case pack water. And we focused on growth in the sparkling beverages in China, so actually Coke grew volumetrically in the third quarter in Japan. So it's clearly about -- some of it's about the choices we make, but we need to focus more on the things we can control in China to have better marketing, innovation and execution. But we see light at the end of the tunnel and long-term investment opportunities for the China business. The Eurasia business is more of a confluence of factors, the spillover from the Middle East conflict, plus there's a set of markets there that are undergoing quite significant macroeconomic adjustments and that is also coming together to kind of create a relatively big headwind volumetrically speaking.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning. To dig a little bit further into fairlife, I guess maybe the size of it at this point, are we nearing $1 billion? How much impact is it having on mix and kind of the prospects as we look to next year? Can it continue to expand or do you have tougher comparisons? Because it's really been a big driver particularly in the past kind of 12, 18 months and just trying to understand the prospects going forward and how much impact it's now having on North American overall sales? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Thanks, Bill. Well, for sure, it's going to be $1 billion brand. It's certainly passed that mark a while ago. I think firstly, like one of the most kind of I think standout facts about the North American businesses, and I think we said it in the script, is the two biggest brands in terms of retail dollars added to the North American beverage landscape by any brand across the whole industry is Coca-Cola Trademark and Fairlife. And that shows you, I think the ability to take something that's been around for 138 years and make it continue to be relevant and take something that's not much more than a decade old and make that relevant too. And so yes, it's having an impact on mix because largely we're consolidating a vertically integrated business and so there's a mechanical effect at the revenue line, which is part of that slightly outsized contribution for mix that I talked about earlier, but it's also delivering on the bottom line. But just to allay fears that somehow that means that the rest of the business is not doing well, no. The North America ex-fairlife is also growing top line, gaining, doing well, and growing profits. So both engines are firing, or all the engines are firing, and it's not just one engine, which I think is very important to understand, and it can certainly continue to expand. I mean, clearly next year we're going to be cycling a very strong year, and we are in the process, as previously advertised, about bringing online more capacity than New York plant is being dug out of the ground or built out of the ground as we speak. And so we will be aiming to blend in that capacity. Clearly, it's going to be hard to cycle this year's numbers until we get the capacity, but I think there's huge opportunity and demand in the marketplace. We just need to continue to run, keep it relevant, and bring online the capacity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKevin Grundy: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. James, I was hoping to pivot to the alcohol strategy and learnings there. I think it's gotten a little bit less attention from investors more recently. The company has about a few years in or so to the strategy, extending some of the brands. You have a number of different partners in the space with a number of different trademarks. Maybe comment, number one, sort of broader learning's here a few years in. And then two, which opportunities you think are more scalable globally and can become a more meaningful part of the portfolio. Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yes. It's a couple of years in, still very early days. I would advertise here a kind of an overall learning that most things take a decade to work out whether they're going to arrive at scale, a minimum 7 years. And that's true, even if you look back at the beverage industry, the most successful of any brands, it was very hard to tell whether we're really breaking through to scale until about year 7 and it took at least till year 10 to get scale and often much longer. So a few years is still relatively early days in terms of really building out something at scale. So that's point number one. Two, we've been taking a measured approach to work out what will work. And we've got some good learnings, and we've pivoted where things didn't work, and we've kind of continued to advance where things are working. I think in terms of -- you kind of -- implicit in the question is like, is one of these going to work and the other is not going to work? I don't think I see this category that way. I don't think there's going to be one killer SKU that is 50% of the market. I think it's going to be much more -- the alcohol industry has more variety and more variety-seeking behaviors. And therefore, I think it's going to be more about us using a combination of some partnered ready-to-drink offerings like Jack and Coke, Bacardi and Coke, Absolut and Sprite, complemented with a set of our own brands, ARTD, like Simply Spiked or Minute Maid, in a portfolio effect. And I think it's going to be about having a robust portfolio of choice, is going to be the approach that is likely to do well in ARTD. And if you look around the world at the few markets, and there are only relatively a few, where ARTD is a meaningful percentage of the beer, relative to beer, then that's the characteristic that stands out. So the question is, can we put together a bundle that could be effective, not just in share terms, which I think is possible, but in terms of making ARTD a relevant size category?\nKevin Grundy: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Moskow from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRobert Moskow: A quick question. You expect price/mix to decelerate next year. Some of it's due to North America, some of it's due to hyperinflationary markets. So do you expect any benefit to volume from that? Like is there elasticity assumption? You did sound very positive about volume into 2025. Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yes. There is a certain mechanical effect to price/mix and volume. In other words, I'm expecting 2025 to be the inverse of the third quarter. In other words, I would expect the emerging markets to retake their more traditional position of growing faster than the developed economies, which will obviously contribute to volume growth, but instead of -- but it won't contribute to a positive price/mix. So I think there will be some stabilization in that kind of relationship such that next year is going to look more like essentially what this year looked like, which is where you've got some volume growth, a more normal level of volume growth, a more normal level of pricing, with a kind of a top-up of what will still be a residue amount of high-inflationary countries. And that's likely to be where 2025 is heading.\nRobert Moskow: Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question today will come from Carlos Laboy from HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nCarlos Laboy: Yes, good morning, everyone. I have a North America-specific question. Can you tell us more about the improving system digital capabilities are being built that you might find most promising as you look forward to accelerating volume and revenue growth? And how are you compelling the bottlers to make investments behind these capabilities?\nJames Quincey: Yes. Sure, Carlos. I mean, from a bottling system point of view, I think in a way, it's the expansion of the digital engagement with the retail system. I mean there was always the electronic ordering in the modern trade, and that's been around a long while. What's really interesting about what's going on is more in the kind of mom-and-pop traditional trade or independent trade part of the marketplace, which is not just the ability to provide a platform, which allows the retailer to engage with the ordering system 24/7 rather than waiting for the pre-seller to turn up. They can engage to add product order -- add to order, they can register service request for the coolers or for merchandising material. But also as we start to get into AI, the system can also start interacting with the retailers with suggested orders and the engagement, not just from the retailer to the bottler in terms of ordering a service that's actually from the bottler to the retailer suggesting orders because of whatever is happening, there might be some events coming up, there might be people like you buy these sorts of things you should add. And so we really see a combination of enhancement to the market developers who are out there. It's not going to go from being a human system to an entirely electronic system. I think it's going to be about the enablement of the humans to be as productive as they can be, whether those are pre-sellers, market developers or the retail operators themselves. And so I think it's very exciting, and the bottlers are leaning in to the investments in this area.\nJames Quincey: So with that, just to conclude, we think we're well positioned to deliver on our ambitions to 2024 and over the long term. We're certainly managing near-term uncertainty as we continue to build our system for long term. And we're confident we will create sustainable value for our stakeholders. Thanks for your interest, your investment in the company, and for joining us this morning.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Today's call is being recorded.[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Robin Halpern, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Halpern, you may now begin.\nRobin Halpern: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We've posted schedules under financial information in the Investors section of our Company website. These reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to this morning to result as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our growth and operating margins. This call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the Company's periodic SEC reports. Following prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question. Reenter the queue to ask follow-ups. Now, I will turn the call over to James.\nJames Quincey: Thanks Robin, and good morning everyone. After a good start of the year, we continued our momentum in the second quarter. In a world with a wide spectrum of market dynamics, our all-weather strategy is working. We're winning in the marketplace by leveraging our scale and continuing to foster a growth mindset. Given our strong year-to-date results, we are raising both our top-line and our bottom line guidance today. This morning, I'll start by discussing the current operating environment and reviewing our second quarter performance, then I'll explain how we're enhancing our capabilities to drive more effective and efficient operations, including leveraging digital and tech-enabled innovations to ultimately contribute to our earnings growth. Finally, John will discuss our financial results and the raised 2024 guidance. In the second quarter, we grew volume, generated strong organic revenue growth and expanded margins while continuing to invest in our business, we also gained value share. This culminated in 7% comparable earnings per share growth despite 10% currency headwinds and 2% headwinds from bottler refranchising. Overall, our industry remains attractive and is expanding. We believe we're well positioned to capture the vast opportunities available to us. Across the world, we're continuing to navigate many varying market dynamics locally to deliver our global objectives. In Asia Pacific, we had strong performance across most of our footprints. In ASEAN and South Pacific, the refranchising of the Philippines is off to a good start. In the Philippines, we grew volume by double digits and drove strong value share gains by increasing focus on affordable packages, including accessible price points and refillable offerings. Growth across ASEAN and South Pacific was driven by strong end-to-end execution across our sparkling portfolio. Our business in India recovered nicely from a slower start to the year, driven by Sprite and Fanta, as well as strong local brands such as Thumbs Up and Maaza. Strong end-to-end execution across our growth flywheel led to double-digit volume growth. In China, consumer confidence remains subdued. We continue to focus on our core business and invest behind profitable long term growth. Lastly, in Japan and South Korea, we generated volume growth during the quarter and won value share. We successfully relaunched Ayataka, a much loved local tea brand in Japan, and we're also benefiting from stronger execution in e-commerce channels. In EMEA, the external environment remains mixed. In Europe, we saw pressure in our away from home business due to some reduced foot traffic and adverse weather in Western Europe. To capture value, we're investing in several highly anticipated activations, including music festivals, the Euro 2024 Football Championship, and of course, the Paris Olympics. We're increasing our focus on brands with strong momentum across our total beverage portfolio, including Fuze Tea and Powerade, and on promising sparkling innovations such as Coke Lemon and Reformulated Sprite. In Eurasia and Middle east, geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty continue to impact our business. We're working closely with our local partners to navigate these headwinds while investing for the longer term. In Africa, despite multiple currency devaluations, strong integrated execution led to robust performance across our markets. For example, in Nigeria, our system quickly responded to the intense inflationary environment by focusing on affordable packages, including accessible price points and refillable offerings, and increasing outlet coverage to win both volume and value share. Across Africa, we grew volume in mid-single digits and similarly won both volume and value share. In North America, we generated robust topline and bottom line growth and one value share. Our volume decline was driven by softness in away from home channels. To offset this, we're partnering with foodservice customers to market food and drink combo meals to drive traffic and beverage incidents. Excluding mainstream packaged water, at-home volumes held up well. Fairlife and Trademark Coke finished number one and number two as the at-home retail sales growth leaders for the industry during the quarter. Our juice business also had a strong quarter and recent innovations including Sprite Chill and Topo Chico Sabores, are off to solid starts. In Latin America, volume momentum continued, led by strength in Mexico and Brazil. Growth was driven across our entire total beverage portfolio. Coca Cola Zero Sugar had a standout quarter with over 20% volume growth, and we're continuing to take integrated execution to the next level by increasing investments behind cold drink equipment to win share of visible inventory and create additional consumer demand. Finally, in global ventures, despite pressures in key markets such as the United Kingdom and China, we generated organic revenue growth and expanded margins. Costa is driving loyalty through targeted promotions like treat drop and innocent gain value share in Europe. Putting it all together, despite an ever changing external environment, our business remains very resilient. The power of our portfolio, amplified by our system's unique capabilities is a clear advantage. While we're delivering on our near term commitments, we're also building capabilities and innovating across our flywheel to become a more agile, effective and efficient organization. Starting with marketing and innovations. Last year, we stood up Studio X, which is our digital and organizational ecosystem that integrates marketing capabilities and connects them to our global network structure. We're producing tailored content at scale and with speed and are able to measure impact in real time. We're also refining our innovation process to prioritize bigger and bolder bets, and we're removing barriers to deliver a more holistic approach, shorten the time to launch and improve success rates. We know that innovations that grow in the second year have a much greater odds for multiyear success and deliver far greater impact. So we focused on sustaining investment and have consistently improved second year performance success rates in each of the past four years. Continued innovation successes include Sprite and Fanta reformulations, Fuze Tea in Europe and Minute Maid Zero Sugar in North America, among many others. As a result of these combined initiatives, we have greatly improved our ability to rapidly produce and deliver marketing content, integrate activations with timely innovations and scale successes to drive the greatest impact. One example from the second quarter, Coca-Cola's partnership with Marvel, which featured nearly 40 different limited edition collectible graphics and QR codes on our packaging to connect consumers with unique augmented reality experiences. We collaborated closely with Marvel Studios and the Walt Disney Company and tapped into the best-in-class animation and activation to quickly scale to over 50 markets. As a result of this and other growth initiatives, Trademark Coca-Cola grew volume and won volume and value share during the quarter. Our marketing and innovation transformation journey contributed to Trademark Coke winning creative brand of the year for the first time ever at the Cannes Lions in June. We won 18 different awards at Cannes Lions. Beyond marketing and innovation, we're flexing our muscle in revenue growth management and integrated execution to sustain competitive advantage. Even in markets with very well developed capabilities, there's potential to be even better. For example, Mexico is one of the markets at the forefront of revenue growth management, and has the highest cold drink equipment density in the world. During the quarter, we drove affordability with refillables and premiumization with single-serve transactions. Our system also added over 80,000 coolers year-to-date. Through these and similar initiatives, we grew volume mid-single digits during the quarter, continuing the momentum from the past few quarters. Each day, consumers enjoy approximately 2.2 billion servings of our products translating into about 800 billion servings annually. This kind of scale gives us unique insights into the consumer, which helps us to better tailor offerings. Emerging technologies, including those enhanced by AI, have the potential to create value for retailers and consumers. For example, we're piloting an AI-based price pack channel optimization tool, across several markets that evaluates opportunities, to better tailor solutions to drive incremental volume and revenue. Early results show that the tool helps improve both our offerings, and speed to market. Our system is also piloting an AI-driven initiative to push personalized messages, to retailers with suggested items based on previous orders and market data. Initial pilots indicate that retailers who receive the messages, are over 30% more likely to purchase recommended SKUs, which results in incremental sales for our retailers and the system. We're just scratching the surface of what's possible, and we're taking steps to seize opportunities down the road. To sum it all, while we recognize there's still much work to be done, to capture the vast opportunities available; we're encouraged by our year-to-date results and efforts to improve, every aspect of how we do business. As we look forward to the second half of the year, the external backdrop remains uncertain, including some signs of pressure in various consumer segments across developed markets. However, thanks to the power of our portfolio, and the unwavering dedication of our system employees, we are confident we will deliver on our updated 2024 guidance and longer-term commitments. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we delivered strong results. We grew organic revenues 15%. This consisted of 2% unit case growth. Concentrate sales were ahead of volume by four points, driven primarily by timing of concentrate shipments, and some disruptions in the global supply chain that we partly expect, to reverse next quarter. Our price/mix growth of 9% in the quarter was primarily driven by two items: one, approximately five points of intense inflationary pricing, across a handful of markets to offset significant currency devaluation. And two, an array of pricing and mix actions across our markets. Excluding the impacts from concentrate shipment timing and pricing from markets with intense inflation. Organic revenue growth during the quarter was at the high end of our long-term growth algorithm. Comparable gross margin was up approximately 200 basis points, driven by underlying expansion, and the benefit from bottler refranchising partially offset by currency headwinds. Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 120 basis points. Comparable operating margin expansion was less than comparable gross margin expansion, due to less benefit from bottler refranchising and greater currency headwinds to comparable operating margin. Putting it all together, second quarter comparable EPS of $0.84 was up 7% year-over-year despite 10% currency headwinds and 2% headwind from bottler refranchising. Free cash flow was approximately $3.3 billion, down approximately $700 million versus the prior year, due to higher tax payments, cycling working capital benefits from the prior year and higher capital expenditures. We continue to take actions, to achieve a fit for purpose balance sheet that, will best support our growth agenda. During the quarter, we raised approximately $4 billion in cash by issuing long-term debt for general corporate purposes. This may include pre-funding upcoming payments related to the IRS tax case and the Fairlife contingent consideration. With respect to our IRS tax case, which we continue to vigorously defend. We're making progress to our next steps, and we expect we will be able to move forward an appeal by the end of the year. Given the continued outperformance of Fairlife, we recorded a charge of $1.3 billion during the quarter. Our estimated final payment related to this acquisition is $5.3 billion, which will be made in 2025. We are encouraged by Fairlife's performance and the value it has created for our company. So far this year, we've realized nearly $3 billion in gross proceeds from bottler refranchising and streamlining our equity investments. We'll continue to prioritize higher growth businesses, and take passive capital off the table. Return on invested capital is 24%, up approximately five points from three years ago. Our balance sheet is strong, as demonstrated by our net debt leverage of 1.5 times EBITDA, which is well below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times. We have ample capacity to pursue our capital allocation agenda, which prioritizes investing to drive further growth, continuing to support our dividend and staying dynamic, agile and opportunistic. As James mentioned, we're proactively managing our portfolio to deliver on our commitments. Our updated 2024 guidance reflects the momentum of our business in the first half of the year, and our confidence in our ability to execute on our plans during the second half of this year. We now expect organic revenue growth of 9% to 10%, and comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 13% to 15%. Bottler refranchising is still expected to be a four to five-point headwind, to comparable net revenues. And we now expect a one to two-point headwind, to comparable earnings per share. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we now anticipate an approximate five to six-point currency headwind, to comparable net revenues and an approximate eight to nine-point currency headwind, to comparable earnings per share for full year 2024. This increase in currency headwind is driven by a small number of intensive treasury markets, while the rest of the currency basket is relatively neutral to our results. All in, we now expect comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus $2.69 in 2023. There are some considerations to keep in mind. We expect unit cases and concentrate shipments to be relatively in line with each other for the full year 2024. Please keep in mind there are two extra days in the fourth quarter. Taking everything into consideration, we expect earnings growth during the remainder of 2024, will be weighted towards the fourth quarter. To summarize, we're encouraged by our track record and the underlying momentum of our business. Our system remains incredibly focused and motivated to drive growth. We're continuing to drive quality top line growth, expand margins, grow comparable earnings per share and improve the return profile of our business. And we're confident we will deliver on our guidance, and longer-term objectives. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDara Mohsenian: Hi, good morning. It'd be helpful to get an update on North America, given questions around consumer spending. Can you just discuss any demand impact you're seeing on your business, any variance in channel performance and how that informs your view going forward? And then also as we transition to a more normalized cost environment, can you give us any perspective on what's a more sustained price mix run rate going forward in North America? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. No problem, Dara. Firstly, overall, it'd be fair to say that the consumer sentiment in aggregate is actually pretty strong, pretty resilient. Within that, there are some softer spots, particularly, I think, which has been relatively put out there already some softness in away-from-home channels, with a little lower traffic and some increase in value seeking for combo meals. So definitely, there's a piece of the lower income consumers, which are either going out slightly less. But when they do go somewhere looking for greater value through combo meals. And then, of course, in the at-home channels, there's a slightly greater focus by those consumers on getting kind of value deals or promo deals. Having said that, there are just as much consumers spending on more premium categories or more premium price points and experiences. So that's all aggregating out at a sort of resilience, for the average overall consumer. Within that, I think we've done very well. We've seen strong growth across the portfolio. We saw a strong growth in Coke trademark in Fairlife, in Topo Chico and juices itself and in aggregate, we won value share in the quarter. So broad-based growth, some hotspots in terms of demand up demand down. But overall resilience for the consumer. And as you look out, the first thing that I think is worth underlining in North America, in particular, is the nature of the price mix. Remember that our North American business, a typically compared to the other parts of the world, we consolidate a set of vertically integrated businesses and a set of franchise kind of concentrate businesses, such that the growth of a channel or a category can produce a mix effect independent of pricing in the marketplace. As you look at the 11 points of price mix in the second quarter in North America, it's important to understand that, only half of that is actually price. The other half is mix. So when the juice drinks and Fairlife and the juice business grows, Topo Chico grows and Dasani is weaker, you get a mechanical business mix effect that, makes the price mix look like it's gone up, but it hasn't really in the marketplace. So think of it as half of it is business mix, and half of it is real pricing in the marketplace, which gets you to a much more logical match, to the level of inflation that's going out - going on in the marketplace in general, such that I think in North America and actually overall in general, around the world, excluding the high - the intense inflation markets John mentioned in the comments. We see that inflation is largely coming into the landing zone, yes, central banks would like to squeeze out another point or so. But generally, we're getting there, and I think that's reflected in our price mix. We still have input costs that are going up, typically, the agricultural ones rather than the metal, or commodity-based ones. But in the end, our strategy remains yes, there'll be cost inflation, yes, we'll look to put it through. Yes, we'll work on productivity. But any pricing we're going to take, we're going to have to earn with the marketing and the innovation and the execution. But it is, as I said earlier, approaching the normalization zone.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks so much. I'd love to have a similar conversation about Western Europe because James, you mentioned a bit on some -- also slowness in away from home. But the summer sports kind of has already kicked off, June was certainly part of it. And so the weather has been challenging, but maybe a little surprising to see the softness in the unit case volume in EMEA. So I'd love some - just a similar run through as you just did in North America on some of the dynamics, particularly in Western Europe? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. So let me first just separate Europe from EMEA, which obviously includes the Middle East and Africa. Africa had a strong second quarter. Volume - good volume growth, building on good volume growth. In the first quarter, price mix. Obviously, there's a lot of swings and roundabouts macro-economically going on in Africa, but actually net-net, the Africa business had a really good quarter, winning volume and value share, managing through the inflation and growth on -- good volume growth and good price growth. The flip side is Middle East. Obviously, the conflict is continuing to affect the business in that part of the world. So there's some headwinds there. And then, if you come to Europe within EMEA, Europe was overall not where we'd like it to be. We'd like to see a little more growth coming out of the European business. And really, it's a complete mix across the countries in Europe. There's more pressure on the away from home in the West than the East. Yes, some of the sporting programs have certainly help, whether it was UEFA that's already happened or Olympics, which is imminently going to start. The sporting has helped, but there's been some pressure on the away from home, as I said in the West, and so the immediate consumption packs have been growing slower there. But the strong programs, but not yet enough to offset the weather in some of the countries, and the same general effect as the U.S. in terms of the lower income consumers seeking a value, and doing less away from home trips. So big picture, Europe, not too dissimilar from the U.S., perhaps a little worse weather and a little more sporting events, but in an aggregate sense, very similar.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBryan Spillane: Hi. Thanks operator. Good morning everyone. John, just a question for you, two points maybe related to the concentrate shipments. One is, I don't think you've talked about expecting that, they'll line up by the end of the year. But I guess, can you talk a little bit about what's driving this? How much of it is the Red Sea and I don't know, just its maybe more difficult to get stuff around versus, just kind of the regular timing differences. And I guess what's underneath this is, should we expect a little bit more volatility in the near term, just around shipments versus units just simply, because the world's a little bit unsettled right now. And the second, if you can just give us a perspective on how much margin gross margin benefited, from the excess shipments in the quarter? Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: Okay. Thanks, Bryan. So on the first question, yes, we had number of events during the quarter that affected that relationship between unit cases and concentrate. You mentioned a couple of them, the ingestion and the Red Sea and Singapore - in LatAm, we had some restocking in the wake of the floods in Brazil, and in our India operations. We had some stocking up to anticipate some future demand. So a range of factors, none of them with a threat - a common threat to them. Our guidance assumes a more normal second half of the year. But as you rightly highlighted, there is likely to be something ahead of us that, we have not anticipated. And if that were to happen, we'd certainly we certainly advise. But our goal is over the longer haul, is to continue to have cases and gallons in line. And with regards to the gross margin impact, there's a slight benefit on both the gross and operating margins related to the stocking, but it's in the tens of basis points and again, reflected in our guidance a year ago, with that leveling out that we expect.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBonnie Herzog: All right, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I did want to ask a little bit more about your away-from-home business, James, which you did touch on. I guess I was hoping to hear how much your business in this channel decelerated in Q2 versus Q1 and what your outlook is for the remainder of the year? And then assuming growth in the channel moderates further, how do we think about the impact this may have on your top line and margins? And maybe just touch on any initiatives you've implemented to accelerate growth in this channel moving forward. I think that would be helpful? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. Thanks, Bonnie. I don't think it would be worth saying as a big deceleration going on as we come into the second quarter from the first quarter. If you just stand back a bit and look at what happened, and I think we were already calling out some softness in away from home, in the back end of last year. And so, I would characterize it more as there's been a slow build, from the back half of last year through the first and the second quarter. First and second quarter may be a little more negative than the back half of last year. But really, it's been a kind of a slow softening rather than anything major and abrupt and it's not like accelerating off a cliff. It's kind of a slow softening it's kind of just running at a softness level when thinking about away from home in the U.S. And then in terms of what we're doing about it, which is obviously the key question, is we've really got - being more focused. On how can we make sure that we bring to bear in the away-from-home channels in a sense, all the thinking that we have historically done on affordability, and price pack architecture in some of the mom-and-pop and line at home channels, to make sure working with our partners across the different channels that we can provide, whether it's the meal combos, or whatever format of offerings. So that there's a laddering of pricing to allow people to stay within the category and the channel. And so, those are rolling out as we speak. We expect to see them making an impact in the years to go.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nStephen Powers: Thank you and good morning. Maybe, John, just to maybe put a wrap around the margin driver conversation and the impact of mix and concentrate timing, et cetera. Year-to-date, the underlying margin performance, both in the quarter and year-to-date, I guess, has been strong. As I'm penciling it outright, I don't - doesn't feel like you're expecting a material difference in the underlying margin performance of the business in the back half despite the slower concentrate sales and some of the macro drivers going, to play that back and confirm that? And if there are any material differences, maybe you could just help us as to what are the other drivers?\nJohn Murphy: Sure, Steve, thanks. So on gross margin, just to maybe highlight the big drivers typically our underlying performance any structural changes we have in the quarter, most of which nowadays as relates to our refranchising activity and then had a currency impact. So year-to-date, we're reflecting almost 200 basis points of increase. And that's primarily driven by structural and underlying with some offset on currency. And for the second half of the year, typically, the margin profile in the second half of the year is slightly lower than the first half. But I would say the overall trends in the second half of the year will be similar, to what we've seen in the first half. And maybe just to step it down on one - down to the operating margin line, not dissimilar. We have had more benefit on the underlying margin in the first half of the year than on structural. And then the second half of the year, I expect it to be more even. And yet, as we've discussed in prior calls, we sort of reserve the right to stay flexible in the event that we make investment decisions that linked to what's happening in our many markets around the world. But overall direction of travel on both the gross and operating line is our margin profile to be strengthening and to be pretty much in line with some of the previous conversations we've had on this topic.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nFilippo Falorni: Hi, good morning everyone. I wanted to ask about the Latin America business. It continues to be a very strong driver of your total company growth with very strong unit case volume. Still very strong price mix. There was obviously some temporary impact with the flooding in Brazil. But just curious a, what is working well? I know your baller relationship have improved significantly over the last couple of years. And also just a general sense of how the consumer is behaving in your key markets, Brazil, Mexico and some of the other countries.\nJames Quincey: Yes. Sure, Filippo. Yes. Latin America had another strong result in the quarter, sustained the volume momentum, as you mentioned, clearly being driven from Mexico and Brazil. It's a pretty broad-based category success story, including not just Coke trademark, but now Coke Zero at 20% volume growth. Obviously, part of this is a long-term capability and momentum building approach with our bottlers in Latin America, really bringing together all of the components of the strategy that we talk about, whether it be the marketing transformation, the focus on innovation, the execution of price packaging in the marketplace, particularly in markets like Latin America, making sure we both have premiumization and opportunities. But also critically important affordability options, whether that be with regular packaging or returnable packaging, but really making sure we have ways of keeping people in the franchise and all executed by the bottling system which has really doubled down, not just on traditional execution, and putting more cool doors out there, but the digitization of their relationships with the retailers. So really, representation of what is possible when all the elements of the strategy of the system are executed in the marketplace. I think it's worth noting that, obviously, yes, strong volume performance of 5%. Please do take in mind that the price mix is heavily affected by the Argentinian high inflation and two-thirds of the price mix is actually, due to Argentina. So that leaves you about roughly 6% for normal inverted e-commerce pricing for the rest of the countries. Nevertheless, a very strong result. In Latin America, very pleasing and looking forward to seeing that continue into the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask a question on just balance sheet cash flow, specifically around Fairlife. Clearly, it's a positive development that Fairlife continues to do so well. The liability does, however, continue to grow. John, can you just maybe comment on what you can do, to perhaps limit the negative impact from raising additional capital to cover fair life, to cover the escrow payment, and specifically from a cash flow perspective in the next 12 to 18 months. And perhaps just an overall view, on how you see net interest expense versus income trending as you have some of these major payments ahead? Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: Sure, Chris, thank you. Well, firstly is we're very pleased with the performance of Fairlife, and the end is in sight relative to the overall construct of the deal we have in place there. With regard to the broader free cash flow conversation, yes the sources we have are cash from operations. And in the short-term, as we continue to re-franchise some of our businesses from the proceeds that come in from that. During the second quarter, we also went into the debt market and we issued some long-term debt. And so, it's really a combination of those three that we are managing very closely, to deal with the end of this year and into 2025, on the outflows that we see. Balance sheet remains strong. We go into 2025 with a clear line of sight as to what needs to be taken care of. And yet, as we have discussed on many occasions, relative to our overall capital allocation strategy. We will continue to invest in the business as appropriate, to support the dividend file. We take care of the Fairlife acquisition and the tax payment that is, is on the horizon with relative to the IRS tax case. So all in all, it's going to be an interesting 18 months to work through. But we feel very confident that the work we've done today prepares us well to manage through it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you, good morning. So James, on the price mix in North America, you mentioned about half of the 11.3 in my mix and the other pretty much pricing, but still quite driven by innovation. Can you talk about the cadence of what you expect moving ahead? Of course, you've done amazing well in the team there in terms of the marketing campaigns, and marketing and around packaging and all of that RGM playbook that you have. The booking ahead, is there any additional gains you expect, and how we should be thinking? I guess, broadly, even not only in North America, but also in Brazil and Mexico, how to think of additional gains in there and as well as in India? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Sure, I mean, absolutely, we're going to continue to press ahead with the marketing, with the innovation, with the price factor, with the execution. That's the way we earn the right to take a reasonable level of pricing. Clearly, some of the inflationary effects and some of the mix effects, are likely to become more subdued as we go into the back half of the years. So I'm not expecting, for example in North America, half of it is from mix and half of it is from core pricing. I think the mixed piece will start to train down over time and in part it does so, because it starts cycling itself. And so I think it's, the key for me is to look through the kind of the mix and the inflation effects and thinking about core pricing. And if you do that as an overall company level and look at the second quarter in its totality. Again there's, as I said, a big piece of it was inflation. You take it out and you're at the 4-ish percent in core pricing, offer 2% volume. There you are right in the sweet spot of the top end of the algorithm that, we've been looking to deliver on. So I think, the kind of the central assumption is a kind of landing zone for these effects like inflation and mix and starting to see more of the price mix being the core actions across the strategy flywheels driving the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi, you delivered 2% case volume growth, and we look across sort of the rest of staples. We're seeing quite a bit of slowdown in volumes. I think you're positive everywhere with the exception maybe of North America. Can you maybe just talk a bit more as you provided your operating environment views, but also AI innovation, new sports, sporting events, these types of things. What should we be looking at over the medium term in terms of volume growth?\nJames Quincey: Yes, so we as from a strategy perspective, have taken the approach over the last number of years, it cannot say even longer, that it's critically important, particularly when times get tougher to try and keep as many consumers in the franchise as possible, rather than trying to re-recruit them at some later stage. And they're in our focus not just on marketing innovation, but affordability within the price pack architecture. So clearly an objective of ours is not to see negative volumes, and to make sure we keep people in and use all the elements to do that. And so, as you say, we've got 2%. In the corridor, we've got - we've had a run right there. We've talked in the past, it remains true today that the central long-term growth algorithm, we're looking for a revenue of 4% to 6%, and we've set ourselves the ambition of staying in the 5% to 6% range, with a balance of volume and price mix. So that's essentially a way of, you know, if you've split that you're saying 2% to 3% in volume and 2% to 3% in price. We were kind of in that range in the quarter with the 2% volume. So I think in the long run, we'll continue to pursue that. Talked earlier this year that, in the shorter term, it's likely to be slightly more price and slightly less volume, which was kind of exactly what happened in the second quarter. So it would not surprise me, as we go through the rest of the year that that remains true, that we see slightly less volume than the kind of standard algorithm, and slightly more price - as pricing tends towards, inflation tends towards the landing zone. And I think that's likely to be true as we go through - the rest of the summer, hopefully the weather gets a bit better. But we're likely to see that slightly less volume, slightly more price. And probably a repetition of where that volume's coming from in terms of the rest of the year, the positives largely being the developing economies, Latin America, India, Africa, Southeast Asia, and to some extent Japan, and the kind of weighing on it a little, the kind of parts of North America and Europe channel and income specific and some of the disruptions from the Middle East. But net-net, we think we've got a strong strategy that's playing out and is winning. And we're confident that we can drive that to get the balanced algorithm of growth, through the rest of this year, for our guidance and into the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRob Ottenstein: Great, thank you very much. I'd like to go back to North America, but look at it more on a category basis [technical difficulty] that I can think of sparkling is doing better than energy as a sector. I'd love to get your thoughts on maybe what the drivers are there. Second, sports strengths, how your new strategy is working, combining Powerade and BODYARMOR under one management team. And then third, any other particular things that you're seeing on the category side that are worth noting? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure Robert. So definitely North America had a good second quarter. The standouts in terms of growth, clearly, actually what's interesting is actually if you look at the Nielsen Universe, and you look at which two trademarks provided most dollar retail growth in Q2, and the answer is Fairlife and Coca-Cola. And so, in a way, you can see that as a sort of microcosm for the overall strategy working. You've got broad ends of the portfolio working and it's being executed in the marketplace and driving really substantial growth. So good performance by Fairlife, good performance by the overall Coca-Cola with growth obviously being led by Coca-Cola Zero. In the sports category, getting better. We had some positive volume growth in BODYARMOR and Powerade. And we're really starting to see, the kind of stabilization with the marketing and the innovation, and some packed price work going on there. We're not yet gaining all the share we want again, but we've stabilized and starting to turn the corner with some of those innovations on Zero and Flash I.V. and Powerade power. So a good kind of step forward and turning the corner and clearly looking to do better. I'm not sure there's much more to say, great quarter and long may at last.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPeter Grom: Thanks operator and good morning. I guess I just wanted to follow-up on Robert's questions specifically on energy drinks Sprite. I mean, it's one of the few categories where we've seen a pretty notable change here. So, do you have any perspective James on what maybe driving the weaker performance. And then as you look ahead, would you anticipate maybe some of this pressure to be short-lived? Is there something you're seeing that would suggest this weakness can persist through the balance of the year and into maybe '25? Thanks.\nJames Quincey: Sure. Well I think therefore. You need to kind of break it up a bit. I mean firstly look, we've had a great partnership with Monster, created tremendous value for Monster for us Coca-Cola and for the bottling partners. Clearly in the case of the U.S., there's been what happens in every category when people create a category, and there's one or two brands. People look for the white spaces and start to innovate, and start to bring new news to the category. I think that's what's happening in energy, particularly in the US. And so, I think working with Monster that will respond to the evolution of the way, the consumers looking at the category. I think it's also important to understand that the energy category, is one of the categories that responds to an overall consumer needs state, of being fueled for their lives. And so, from a company point of view, we see that as something where we bring multiple brands, to bear against that needs state. And each brand in each category needs to play its part in kind of delivering on that. Each one has to do their own work to do it. But I think there's more to be done across the board, including in the Monster energy portfolio. We're working with them on that. And then I think internationally, there's robust growth in the energy category and making good progress around the world in different ways and different forms. So I think, one has to kind of pull apart energy category and look at it kind of geographically, to see that overall it's still got some good growth, and there's different jobs to be done in different parts of the world.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Charlie Higgs from Redburn. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nCharlie Higgs: Hi James, John. Hope you're both well. I've got a question on Asia Pacific. The performance in Q2, please. Where volumes are up 3% and price mixed is down 3%. Can you maybe just talk a bit more about the volumes up 3%, and specifically how China performed, and what you're seeing on the ground there in China in Q2. And then the price mix down 3%, is that purely just negative geographic mix from India and Philippines, also in Japan, or was there negative pricing within that? Thank you.\nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. I'll take it in reverse order, Charlie. Yes, the negative pricing is more than driven by the mix effect. So core pricing is positive if you went operating unit-by-operating unit, but overall Asia price mix is negative, because of the way the mathematics of the thing works. But the central answer there is it's more than just geography mix. Geography mix is consuming core pricing and taking it down to minus 3%. Then if I go back to the performance of the different operating units, clearly the big swing in Asia-Pacific is driven by the bounce back of India. You'll remember that in the first quarter, India had a soft first quarter. The second quarter was very strong. And so that produces obviously a big swing in the results. So India had a good double-digit growth of volume in the second quarter. Still very bullish on India. Still very realistic in terms of it won't be a straight line into the future, but they certainly had a good quarter in the second quarter. We also saw good volume growth across Southeast Asia, including also volume growth across Japan and South Korea. Volumes were negative in the China operating unit. There's two parts to this story. The first is, yes, there's a general macro softness as the overall economy works through some of the structural issues around real estate, pricing, et cetera, et cetera. But within the things that we control, we have essentially been prioritizing and restructuring where we invest across the category portfolio. And focusing more on sparkling and juice drinks and teas. And deprioritizing what is essentially case-packed water, where we - don't make money in China. So the overall volumes were negative in China, but that's entirely driven by the de-prioritization of the water. And actually, I think the sparkling volume was slightly positive in China for the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Question for John, please, just kind of building on some of the questions earlier on cash flow. Can we get an update, please, on timing of potential bottler re-franchising? I think it's probably largely a question on CCBA, and understanding that market conditions may potentially dictate. But can you help us how you're currently thinking about potential timing there? And then as you're thinking about value creation for shareholders, how much does EPS solution come into that? We hear that from shareholders sometimes, if at all, as you're thinking about moving forward with that? Thanks.\nJohn Murphy: So regarding the timing, we're not giving out dates as to when we expect the refranchising process to finish, we're staying very thoughtful, disciplined in recruiting new partners in the areas that are still outstanding. And so, there's good work underway, but no imminent decisions and we'll advise as that work bear fruition. But I think the overall message is, we continue to be very clear internally on the path forward. And we'll expect over the couple of years to have the both of the refranchising, John, if not all of us. With regard to the impact on EPS dilution, it's a mechanical effect that comes from the broader strategic decisions that, we've - that we believe are right for the Coca-Cola Company, and over time for the Coca-Cola system. The refranchising work that started back in the mid-teens is demonstrating time and again that the overall system benefits, when there's a step change in overall performance. And with that step change, we benefit over the longer haul to - as you've seen this year, there is a mechanical impact on the EPS line. But longer term, we think that the broader value proposition of the Coca-Cola Company is staying very focused on what we do best, and having a balance sheet then that's designed to support what we do best, working in partnership with great partners around the world, is the recipe for us to ease and exceed our long-term growth model.\nOperator: Our last question today will come from Robert Moskow from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks for the question Maybe I missed it, but did you make any commentary about your intentions on marketing investment for the year, whether anything has changed since the start of the year. I think you talked about maybe some surgical efforts in certain markets in certain categories. But can I assume that there's no signal here that, needs to be incremental investment to improve volume?\nJames Quincey: Let me attack the answer in a different way. Our bias is to lean in and invest where we see opportunities. And to the extent that we continue to see opportunities, we continue to invest. And if we see more opportunity, we'll invest more. And the contrary is also true. If we see softness that doesn't warrant certain level of investment, then we will look to pull back. Having said that, there's nothing particularly in the guidance that's trying to tell you, is changing radically in one direction or the other. Yes, we continue to see the need for marketing pressure. It's not a fixed sum that, is not subject to inflation. But there's nothing in the guidance that's trying to tell you something radically different. It's very much we continue to invest and drive the top line, and we see the two marching together. Okay. Thanks, Robert. That was the last question. So to summarize, we're building a culture that emphasizes improving every aspect of how we do business. We have lots of opportunities in front of us. We think we're well positioned to capture these opportunities, and we're confident that we will successfully execute our strategy and create value for - our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest. Your investment in our company and for joining us this morning. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions]  \n I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations department if they have any questions.\n I would now like to introduce Ms. Robin Halpern, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Halpern, you may now begin. \nRobin Halpern: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer. \n We've posted schedules under Financial Information in the Investors section of our company website. These reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to this morning to results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our growth and operating margins.\n This call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC report. Following prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. [Operator Instructions]\n Now I will turn the call over to James. \nJames Quincey: Thanks, Robin, and good morning, everyone. We're off to a good start this year as our first quarter results continued the momentum we've been building by executing our all-weather strategy. The operating backdrop differed greatly across our markets once again, but our powerful portfolio, coupled with our systems capabilities, equip us with the agility we need to deliver on our 2024 guidance, which we are updating today.\n This morning, I'll discuss the drivers in the quarter and how we use our scale and growth mindset to deliver these strong results. Then I'll highlight how we continue to meet consumer needs and grow our total beverage portfolio. Finally, John will discuss our financial results and updated 2024 guidance.\n In the first quarter, we grew volume and expanded comparable margins, and we continued to invest across the business. We're managing currency fluctuations to deliver earnings growth as shown by the 7% comparable earnings per share growth despite 9% currency headwinds, and we gained value share in both at-home and away-from-home channels.\n Across the world, we're continuing to win in the market by leveraging our scale and relying on our local expertise of our bottling partners. In Asia Pacific, momentum continued across a large portion of our business, including Japan and South Korea, Philippines and Thailand. We gained traction in Indonesia with a return to volume growth. India's momentum was impacted by some temporary factors that recovered at the end of March.\n In China, retail sales growth continues to improve, but consumer confidence is still below 2019 levels. We remain optimistic about the many opportunities ahead of us, and we're stepping up our execution in a number of ways. For example, greater focus on our core business for a more segmented market approach and more surgical horizontal market and execution.\n In EMEA, we're seeing gradual improvement in macro trends in Europe, leading to improved consumer confidence. We paired Sprite with spicy new locations to drive momentum in away-from-home channels. Fuze Tea and POWERADE also generated strong performance, and Jack Daniels and Coca-Cola expanded to 6 more European markets during the quarter.\n Africa saw continued volume momentum from last quarter, while navigating a number of markets with significant currency devaluations. Geopolitical and economic challenges in Eurasia and the Middle East continue to affect our business in the region. We are working closely with local partners to manage these challenging dynamics, and we're committed to investing behind the strength of our brands for the long term.\n North America volume had a slow start to the quarter before posting sequential improvement in each of the last 2 months of the quarter and elasticities remain favorable, leading to ongoing share gains. The launch of Coke Spiced featured compelling in-store displays. Across our sparkling softdrink brands, Zero Sugar sugar performance was strong, and we introduced 12-ounce slim cans to further drive premiumization. Value-added dairy continued across fairlife and Core Power in sports drinks, notwithstanding the noncash impairment charge that John will speak to in more detail.\n We believe our 2-brand strategy with POWERADE and BODYARMOR is gaining traction, and we've seen improved share trends. While we still have work to do, the stepped up execution by our dedicated sales force in driving improved on-shelf execution and we're encouraged by the continued growth in sports water and the more recent BODYARMOR innovations, including Zero Sugar and Flash I.V.\n While inflation has moderated and wages continue to trend upward in North America, we're closely monitoring consumer sentiment and traffic trends between at-home and away-from-home consumption. In Latin America, volume momentum continued. Performance was driven by strength in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia, while Argentina continued to experience high inflationary conditions. We have quality leadership across our portfolio in Latin America, with Coca-Cola Zero Sugar continuing its strong performance. Sparkling flavors, sports, juices and alcohol ready-to-drink also performed well during the quarter.\n Commercial initiatives are driving improved shelf space and basket incidence supported by ongoing outlet digitization. We have suggested order capabilities in digital platforms that reach more than 3 million customers in the region.\n Across developed markets, the overall inflationary environment is normalizing. However, across developing emerging markets, there continues to be a handful of markets that are experiencing intense inflation, which is driving elevated pricing, offset by incremental currency headwinds. We're proactively managing these volatile environments, and we feel confident we have the playbook to navigate challenges locally, while continuing our momentum at a consolidated level.\n We're continuing to spin our strategic flywheel faster across total beverage portfolio. And as discussed at CAGNY, we're building loved brands and innovating and delivering bigger, bolder bets. In the first quarter, we launched K-Wave as part of the Coke Creations platform in markets across 5 operating units. K-Wave celebrates Korean pop or K-pop fans, includes a global collaboration with 3 K-pop groups and an AI-based fan experience. Our growing number of Coke Creations are different with each iteration and, by design, are only available for a limited time. This generates buzz and excitement building relevance for the brand and reconsideration for Coke with Gen Z drinkers.\n We also know that sometimes the most successful lasting innovation is simply improving the taste of existing drinks. Using our deep in-house flavor expertise and understanding of the science of taste, we have worked to refine the recipes for Fanta and Sprite to meet consumer preferences across many markets. These changes bring new consumers to our brands as well as remind current consumers what drew them to their favorite beverages in the first place.\n The strong Fanta performance in markets from Brazil to Germany to the U.S. this quarter is largely due to this type of innovation, which was supported by marketing messages focused on taste and on tying the brand to snacking occasions at local festivals, like Carnival in Brazil.  \n Elsewhere in our total beverage portfolio, Minute Maid Zero Sugar kicked off its global campaign in North America, leveraging influencers, social media and connected commerce activations with key customers. We're building on our innovations by driving awareness and excitement through an increasingly digital marketing media mix. \n Our total beverage portfolio plays a lead role, as shown by the New Guy campaign in the U.S. this quarter, which featured multiple grounds across categories. Innovation is woven into the fabric of our culture, and we're encouraged by our innovation pipeline as we look forward to the rest of 2024.\n Moving across the flywheel, we're leaning into integrated execution to drive basket incidence and create incremental value for customers. We work closely with our bottling partners and went bigger with in-store displays to inspire transactions around key events like NCAA March Madness in the U.S., and we'll do this again later this summer with the Olympic and Paralympic Games. As a system to improve quality availability, we increased outlets by 2%, added more than 600,000 cooler doors and increased our share of cold space and overall shelf space in stores.\n We benefited from global scale, while maintaining local relevance by tying our brands to regional meals occasions. For example, in Japan, we've associated Coke with Wagyu and Yakiniku through the path to purchase, using end-to-end consumer messaging and partnering with key customers in the modern trade and convenience retail. We have seen strong Coca-Cola revenue growth in Japan.\n While we continue to grow our business, we also strive to positively impact the communities we serve. We do this by focusing on the issues that matter most to our system, and we share our status and learnings each year when we publish our business' sustainability report. Putting it all together, it's early in the year, but we're off to a good start. We have confidence we will achieve our guidance for the year.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to John. \nJohn Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results marked a continuation of the underlying momentum in our business, driven by a strong and focused system. We delivered another quarter of volume growth, even as we cycled strong results. Additionally, we completed the refranchising of several bottlers during the quarter, leading to further comparable margin expansion.\n We progressed on our refranchising agenda, while making sure we best position our system to deliver long-term growth, and we earn a fair return on our investments. We continue to invest behind our portfolio with discipline and flexibility, thanks to our enhanced resource allocation agenda.\n During the quarter, we grew organic revenues 11%. We had 1% unit case growth. Concentrate sales were behind unit case volume by 3 points, driven by 1 less day in the quarter and the timing of concentrate shipments, primarily in Mexico and the Middle East. \n Our price/mix growth of 13% in the quarter was driven by approximately 6 points of intense inflationary pricing across a handful of markets to offset significant currency devaluation, pricing actions across a number of markets and a couple of points of favorable mix.\n Excluding impacts from intense inflationary pricing, organic revenue growth in the first quarter was at the high end of our long-term growth algorithm. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 130 basis points driven by underlying expansion and a benefit from bottler refranchising, partially offset by the impact of currency headwinds.\n Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 60 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by strong top line growth and bottler refranchising, partially offset by currency headwinds and an increase in marketing investments. Markets experiencing intense inflation represent only a single-digit contribution to our volume, but continue to have an outsized impact on the shape of our P&L.\n Putting it all together, first quarter comparable EPS of $0.72 was up 7% year-over-year, including 9% currency headwinds, which were driven by currency devaluation in markets experiencing intense inflation. Free cash flow was approximately $160 million, an increase from the prior year.\n Before moving on, I want to discuss 2 items that are included in our first quarter reported results, a $765 million charge related to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability for our acquisition of fairlife. Our final payment related to the fairlife acquisition will take place in 2025. This payment has grown as fairlife has outperformed. We continue to be encouraged by our ability to scale fairlife organically.\n Secondly, a noncash impairment charge of $760 million related to BODYARMOR. While we are taking a charge to reflect revised projections and a higher discount rate since the acquisition date of BODYARMOR, we believe in the power of our 2 sports brand strategy with POWERADE and BODYARMOR. We're taking actions to help create long-term value, and we're seeing signs that this strategy is working.\n Our balance sheet remains strong and our net debt leverage of 1.6x EBITDA is below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. This gives us ample capacity for potential upcoming payments in 2024 related to the IRS tax case, which we continue to vigorously defend, and the upcoming fairlife payment in 2025.\n We continue to remain consistent in our approach to prioritizing our capital allocation. We're committed to investing to drive growth and to support our dividend, which we have raised for 62 consecutive years.\n We're confident our business model has the flexibility to allow us to deliver on our overall objectives. Our updated 2024 guidance reflects the underlying momentum of our business, and we now expect organic revenue growth of 8% to 9%, and comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 11% to 13%. Our revised top line guidance is solely driven by higher-than-expected inflationary pricing in a handful of markets, which we expect to moderate throughout the year.\n Bottler refranchising is still expected to be a 4- to 5-point headwind to comparable net revenues and a 2-point headwind to comparable earnings per share, but will have a positive impact on both our margins and the return profile of our business. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate 4- to 5-point currency headwind to comparable net revenues, and an approximate 7 to 8-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2024.\n This increase in currency headwind is driven by intense inflationary markets, while the rest of the currency basket is relatively neutral to our results.\n Our underlying effective tax rate for 2024 is now expected to be 19%. All in, we continue to expect comparable earnings per share growth of 4% to 5% versus $2.69 in 2023. There are some considerations to keep in mind. We estimate the ongoing conflict in the Middle East had approximately 1 point of impact on volume growth during the first quarter of 2024. It's unclear how long this impact will last. The cadence of structural impact will be larger in the second and third quarters due to the timing of transaction closing during the first quarter and the seasonality of the businesses we refranchised.\n Finally, there will be 2 additional days in the fourth quarter. To sum it up, and as James said, the year has started off well. We remain focused on the execution of our all-weather strategy. And thanks to the partnership of our system and the ongoing dedication of our people, we're confident we can create value for our stakeholders and deliver on our guidance for the year. And as we said at CAGNY, we're primed for performance in 2024 and over the long term.\n With that, operator, we are ready to take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \n Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. \nBryan Spillane: John, I wanted to ask a question about gross margins. In the quarter, there was about a 100 basis point tailwind from structural benefits and then also -- or structural change and then, I think, 60 basis points benefit underlying. If we kind of take that first quarter performance and kind of think about it over the balance of the year, can you just give us some context of how we should be thinking how much of that we should extrapolate going forward? \n Maybe what some of the headwinds, tailwinds would be? But just given the gross margins were so much better, our gross profit dollars were so much better than we were all modeling. I just want to kind of get a sense of how much of that we should bank in our estimates going forward. \nJohn Murphy: Thanks, Bryan. So as we think about the full year, we're going to continue to have a tailwind from the refranchising work that we have discussed. And so I think that's going to flow through throughout the year. We expect to continue to have some expansion as reflected in our ongoing and the growth model, driven by both positive impacts and some productivity fee. The input horizon is more normalized. We do have some elevation on juice and sugar, which we'll continue to have. But the net of it all is that we'll have some tailwinds in the underlying area.\n Currency will continue to be a headwind, and you can kind of extrapolate that out for the year. So the net of it all is it will be primarily driven by the refranchising efforts positively, some underlying expansion, offset by the currency headwind. And as we reflected in our guidance, the top line growth continues to be a primary driver and the quality therein will -- I think will ensure that on a sustained basis, that expansion. Albeit not as potentially aggressive every quarter, but that expansion will be in our favor going forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. \nDara Mohsenian: So I was just hoping you could give a bit of a deeper dive into North America, a, just wanted to get an update on what you're seeing from the consumer? Any channel shifts in terms of away-from-home versus at-home and the sequential improvement you discussed within Q1, is that something that's expected to continue going forward? And then just b, price/mix was very strong at 7% in North America, can you unpack that between mix and pricing and just how you think about the balance between pricing mix and volume going forward in the balance of the year in North America? \nJames Quincey: Sure. Overall, in terms of the consumer and how that fed into the channels, the U.S. still remains in good shape. There is some purchasing power compression in the lower-income echelons. And I think it's quite clear that there's some behavioral shift there looking for value. I think that has led to a marginal channel weighting or shift, if you like, with slightly more at-home volume versus away-from-home. \n I would emphasize this is at the periphery rather than a big shift. But the margin, slightly more value seeking, slightly more at-home, slightly less away-from-home. And so we've been stepping up our RGM efforts, our packaging efforts and executing against that, so that we have continued to gain share in the quarter.\n As it relates to pricing, of the 7 points in the first quarter, approximately 2 of those are mix or timing related, the rest is pricing, and we expect that to moderate as the year goes on. And we expect to see 2024 be in a much more normal year in terms of pricing, it's largely going to be as it was pre-COVID. So we're expecting to see 2024 end up with a much more balanced growth equation over the rest of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. \nLauren Lieberman: I wanted to talk a little bit about how the company manages when the dollar is strong. So outside of the markets with extreme inflation, we know from a strategic standpoint, of course, the ongoing RGM efforts and pack and channel and so on. But just sort of from a more tactical standpoint, when you're in a strengthening dollar environment, I was curious if you could share a bit more about how you manage that at a local level. Because the delivery of dollar-based EPS has become a key focus and hallmark, frankly, in the last couple of years, and I thought a bit more color on how you go about that in a more tactical sense could be helpful. \nJames Quincey: Sure. So markets outside the U.S. will roughly break down into 2 types. There'll be those perhaps typified by Europe, Japan, Australia, some of the obvious ones, where the competition and the economic dynamics of the marketplace are predominantly local currency. And so in these markets, our approach is to compete locally in the local currency given the cost structures in those areas. And we generally marry that with a long-term currency hedging or selling forward program, such that we can have a clear anticipation during the course of the year as to what that's likely to turn into.\n So that's one set of markets. And we essentially have put ourselves in a position through the hedging program that we can compete locally and do what's necessary to continue to win in those marketplaces, which is generally what happens. \n The second bucket of countries, and that's much more apparent in recent quarters than even historically, where you have higher -- whether you want to say the chicken and the egg, a higher level of devaluation and a higher level of inflation. These tend to be more emerging market economies where there is less availability of economically attractive hedging programs. And so we tend to have hedged them.\n But also given the elevated nature of the dynamic between the inflation and devaluation, we do -- we obviously are competing locally. So for example, in the Argentinas of the world, we're competing predominantly locally to win in that marketplace and set ourselves out for the long term. And the inflation -- it's very cyclical as these markets cycle through higher inflation and high devaluation. \n Sometimes, the dollar value of those businesses shoots up. And sometimes it shoots down. At the moment, they're in as of shooting down in dollar terms. So they're declining in dollar terms, even though they're growing a lot in currency neutral. But we look at it on a long-term basis to win using the RGM and all the other investments we make in the business. And of course, they're not all in sync with each other. So it's a portfolio management question.  \n And then overlay that is, of course, a corporate approach in terms of prioritization, where and how to invest, whether it's a lean in and lean in with what sorts of investments, such that we are able to deliver on our corporate level commitment to make sure that the end of it, the sum of all the competing locally, is more than the sum of the parts, such that we can deliver a consistent level of U.S. dollar EPS growth. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. \nStephen Robert Powers: James and John, you both mentioned incremental progress on the 2-brand strategy and sports drinks with BODYARMOR and POWERADE. I was hoping you could expand a bit more on what you're seeing there that gives you that encouragement and what you see as the key initiatives for that strategy as we go forward. \nJames Quincey: Sure. Clearly, we haven't progressed as fast as we would like with regard to BODYARMOR, notwithstanding the step-up in the discount rate, and that's reflected, as John talked earlier, in the charge. Notwithstanding that, we do see long-term value in the dual strategy, particularly in the U.S. between POWERADE and BODYARMOR. We're off to a good start with some of the plans the Zero Calorie version is ahead of expectations. The Flash I.V. has got some double-digit share. And the Sport Water version is one of the fastest-growing premium water brands.\n So some product innovation is getting some traction, a new partnership with NHL on the marketing front. And on the execution front, a stepping up of the merchandising and sales force focused directed just at the sports drinks category, which is helping improve the share trend in the category. Although not at the rate we had hoped initially, but we think we are in good shape going forward. Obviously, we'll have an opportunity with the Olympics to really continue to step that up. So plans in place across the product innovation, the marketing and the execution, and we think this will come to fruition over the course of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. \nBonnie Herzog: I was hoping for a little more color on your performance in Asia in the quarter, and then whether it met your expectations or possibly fell short. Also, you mentioned that declines in China more than offset growth in some of your key markets in the region. So maybe just hoping for a little bit more color on your business in China, and how quickly you expect the market will recover, again, given the broader macro challenges in the region. \nJames Quincey: Sure. We'll let us go around Asia quickly. I mean China, we are cycling in the first quarter a very strong Chinese New Year first quarter from 2023. So I think we had a solid a solid quarter in China. We focus very well on having a good Chinese New with sparkling, which was good. We deprioritized some of the lower-value water in order to do so. And as we commented earlier, the Chinese confidence isn't as strongly rebounded as some of the other markets versus 2019. And so we see an overall environment where there'll be growth, perhaps not at the top historic levels, but there'll be growth.\n And so we're there we're very much focused on what we can control and the things we need to do. There's still huge opportunities in the Chinese marketplace, notwithstanding the macros. And there's a lot we can execute against in the marketing, in the innovation, in the execution in the marketplace, in the stores and with RGM. So there's a lot for us to achieve that's within our control in China.\n In the rest of Asia, we had a good quarter in Japan and South Korea. Good share gains, really starting to pick up the pace. Also, likewise, we had a strong performance in the Philippines, which is an important market for us, and so that was good in the quarter. The one that was atypical or at least compared to recent quarters was India had a slower start in January and February. As we've talked in previous calls, we're very bullish on the long-term prospects for the Indian business. \n And we're also very clear it's not going to be a straight line of metronomically consistent growth. And so it wasn't in the first quarter. It was a little softer January, February, but March and April have now bounced back. And so we expect to see India continue to have a strong year this year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. \nAndrea Teixeira: So can you comment on EMEA? You called out Nigeria, Germany and South Africa growing unit case and driving the growth in volumes. But if my math is correct, ex-inflationary countries, your price/mix in the rest of EMEA was about 7%. So can you comment on the state of the consumer there similar to what you said about the U.S.? And if you feel the 7% price/mix is more stable countries, sustainable going forward? \nJames Quincey: Sure. EMEA, also this quarter had a whole series of moving pieces. As you started on price/mix, clearly, there's a number of countries in there with very high inflation. Not just Nigeria, but also Turkey and somewhat mathematically unlikely, some of the smaller African countries given the level of inflation can also make a difference to the pricing lever in the EMEA segment. So the EMEA segment has a substantive piece of pricing that is the inflationary marketplaces, including many markets you wouldn't normally suspect.\n And so that's a roundabout way of saying, actually, the -- in Europe, our pricing is much more normalized. And a bit like the U.S., we both see improved macros. Actually, I think that, today, a number of the markets came out and said they've come out of recession from the previous quarters. Like the U.S., we see the lower income consumers remaining under pressure. And at the margin, slightly more shift towards value-orientated channels, at-home orientated channels and lesser from the away-from-home. And clearly, that's related to our focus, not just on the marketing and the innovation with the RGM and affordability and driving premiumization.\n So Europe, not too dissimilar a story compared to the U.S. But the EMEA segment mix is in both the Middle East conflict and quite a number of the high-inflation countries. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. \nChristopher Carey: So I want to ask about brand Coca-Cola, Trademark Coca-Cola relative to the sparkling flavor businesses. I think unit case for sparkling flavors outperformed trademark Coca-Cola in 2021 and in 2022, but this normalized into the back half of 2023. That's continued into Q1 of this year. So can you just perhaps expand on whether there's anything distinct that's occurring here between brand or Trademark Coca-Cola and sparkling flavors, regional considerations, brand considerations? I just think it's noteworthy, given the relative outperformance, that has just turned the other way a little bit. So any context would be helpful. \nJames Quincey: Yes. Look, clearly, both Trademark Coke, original taste, Coke Zero, have been having a good run over the last number of years and really focused on performance. But also perhaps unlike in times more recently passed, Sprite and Fanta have also been doing well. This has been a intentional focus for the company and the bottling system, which historically, we have looked at and managed sparkling altogether. \n And very deliberately a number of years ago, we separated to really focus in on Coke, Coke Trademark on its own with all the innovations, whether they be things like the K-Wave innovations, or continuing to focus on Coke Zero with updated -- the updated formulas or focusing on original case Coke with the Marvel activations that's just coming out. A real focus on Coke, and that has been part of what has driven success over the last number of years. And ultimately, for the company to do well, Coke has to do well. It's the kind of a mathematical certainty, and that has certainly been what's driving this.\n And then the separation of Sprite, Fanta and some of the regional brands particularly perhaps some of the Indian soft drink brands like Thums Up, have really got their own deserved focus. Actually, if you put all the flavored sparkling brands together, they would be one of their own big FMCG companies in their own right. \n And so really, what you're seeing is this focus on the formulas of Fanta and Sprite, really doing much better and being teamed up each time we've brought it to marketplace with a full marketing package. For example, Fanta in the U.S. had a good run as we updated the formula and relaunched the marketing.\n And so I think the -- it's been doing really well. I think the only a place where we've not succeeded, particularly with some of the flavors are in the Chinese marketplace, for example, given -- and that's really a Sprite question there. That we need to continue to focus on to do better with Sprite in China. But otherwise, Fanta, Sprite and particularly the Indian flavor brands have done very well, and of course, Coke is a pretty broad-based success story. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. \nFilippo Falorni: I wanted to ask on the Latin America business. Clearly, there's a lot of impact from hyperinflation in the market, but the volume trends continue to remain very solid in the region from a unit case standpoint. So maybe can you talk about the consumer environment there. And do you think that you can continue to see volume good in Latin America going forward in some of your key initiatives in the region? \nJames Quincey: Yes. So the simple answer is yes. We believe the businesses can continue to grow in Latin America, both in volume and revenue terms. It's been a long-term success part of the business with a very strong system between ourselves and the bottlers focused on the marketing, the innovation, the execution on the RGM. \n We'll continue to build on the recent year's momentum. Performance this quarter was strong in -- particularly in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia. Obviously, Argentina was impacted by the macroeconomic conditions. But we have a very tight system. We're very focused on what needs to be done and continuing to invest in capacity in order to continue to unlock the volume growth. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. \nPeter Grom: I had a question as it pertains to the fairlife liability. Clearly, this is a sign that the underlying business is doing extremely well, but we've also seen kind of the value of this liability increased quite a bit over the last year or so. As we look ahead, is there anything you can share any guardrails you can provide in terms of how we should think about the liability changing as we move through the balance of the year and into '25? \nJohn Murphy: So the liability is very much linked to the ultimate performance. And as we close out this quarter, we're reflecting our latest and best estimates as to what that will be. The momentum of the business has been very strong. And actually, I think it's going to continue. And if anything, there may be some more upside. But for now, we're reflecting our best estimates for what that liability ultimately would be. Just to keep in mind that the liability will be -- it's an early 2025 ending to it. And we'll update as we go through this year in the event that the projections evolve. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities. \nWilliam Chappell: Just a little bit more question on the innovation side. Certainly, it's been an innovative company over the past 4 or 5 years and more new products out there. But it's tough to kind of track some of these products that have been launched that are still on the shelf a year or 2 years later. So I guess the question is, are there things in place in terms of percentage of sales should come from new products in a certain region in a year or a number of new products that need to be launched per year? I understand you wanting to be more innovative, but just trying to -- what kind of guardrails or what kind of accountability there is around that kind of innovation. \nJames Quincey: Sure. I think the first thing is to bear in mind a certain segmentation of the innovation. And what I mean by that is you've got a strong focus on a part of the innovation that's around renovation of the core. So you get into kind of a question, okay, well, is the new Coke Zero formula or the updated Fanta formula backed with the new marketing campaign, is that -- you're going to count that as innovation or not. So the first thing is to understand that there's different types of innovation at play here all driving the business. One being. In a sense, the renovation of core brands.\n Secondly, our launch is intended to be ins and outs. So some of the Coke Creations, where really the focus is on reengaging with consumers in a novel way to drive relevance of the core brand. So you're not expecting it into the last. And then, of course, there are things we're putting into the marketplace that are new innovations, whether it would be something like a Minute Maid Zero Sugar or something like the Absolut SPRITE or the Jack Daniels and Coke. So these things -- and then, of course, you've got nonproduct-based innovation, like it's a new bottle size or a new can size. So we track across all these things.\n As it relates to product innovation, we have a very clear set of metrics on whether it's still growing on the fifth quarter after its launch. So is it cycling itself and continuing to accelerate. So there's a lot of cliometrics. But we do not set ourselves an artificial strategy objective of it has to be X percent from innovation. As it happens, about 25% of the growth comes from innovation, but it is not set that way. \n In the end, we are not setting ourselves up to sell what we make. We've got to sell what the consumers want to buy. So it's about doing justice to every brand and every idea and every package and every channel, and then service that resulting demand. If that is led by a great new innovation or by 138th year of classic Coke, then that's the answer. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlos Laboy from HSBC. \nCarlos Alberto Laboy: James, market development is a culture, right, it's a philosophy. And it seems to me that so much of what you're doing and what you talked about today is intended to get shelf replenishers to become better market developers for faster growth. Can you speak to how this evolution is going in the system? Are there any regions or countries that stand out for momentum in this system transformation of moving towards richer market development and to less shelf replenishment order taking? \nJames Quincey: Yes, sure. Look, I think each part of the world is in its journey to continue to add value to the retail. Because in the end, this is about, together with the bottlers, making sure that we are adding value to the retailers business. Our objective at the retail level is to grow the beverage category faster than the average of their business, and for us to grow our portfolio of brands faster than the beverage category. \n And to do that, we've got to add more value, and that takes different forms in different places. And so as that happens, for example, the pre-sellers, they move from just order taking to account development. As AI comes in, it generates a suggested order for the retail outlet that is demonstrably more efficient in helping the retailer drive sales and then allows the salesperson to do more account development and to expand on different ideas.\n So at each stage, it's about taking the system capabilities to the next level so that we can continue to add value for the retailer. Everything that was done in the past starts to become the price of entry in the future, and so we need to keep adding value. And so I think there's a strong growth in capabilities all around the world specifically focused on the channel structure that the bottlers have in any given market. \nJohn Murphy: And if I may just add, James, I think one of the big changes in the last 3 to 5 years is that the ambition that we share, respectively, with all of our bottling partners is much more at the high end of what it should be than scattered. So I think that's -- and then it's working backwards from there as to what does it take to deliver that ambition. And yes, some are further along than others, but it's the ambition is that starting point that I think is helping to drive the progress that we're seeing each quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Moskow from TD Cowen. \nRobert Moskow: Just a couple of clarifying questions. James, I think on the last earnings call, you were very clear that you view the business... \nJames Quincey: You have to speak up. We can't hear you. \nRobert Moskow: My apologies. Can you hear me now? \nJames Quincey: Yes. \nRobert Moskow: I think last quarter, you spoke very specifically about the business being a 2% unit volume grower. Given the timing impact, is that still how you would view this year? And then secondly, can you be more specific about those timing differences in Mexico and I think the Middle East between units and concentrate? What causes those discrepancies? And do they naturally reverse in the coming quarter? \nJames Quincey: Sure. Yes, timing differences naturally reverse between concentrate units and unit cases. Partly, it happens when there is a different number of days in the quarter, then we have the -- we use the 445 system for all sorts of reasons. And what that causes sometimes is different numbers of shipping days in quarters. And so you undersell when you got less days, like the first quarter. And of course, in the fourth quarter this year when there's 2 extra days, there'll be way more concentrate units than there were cases, relatively speaking. So over the course of time, these anomalies or differences reverse themselves or average themselves out.\n And then as regards to the 2% volume, yes, look, I have a very strong view that the -- our overall ambition to see our revenue grow at the top end of the algorithm, I'm leaving aside the intense inflation countries for the sake of the argument at the moment, we want to grow at that 5% to 6% range. And we want that to have a balanced contribution from volume and price/mix. So implicitly, looking for 2% to 3% on volume. And I think we talked last quarter that in the current circumstances, that's likely to be slightly less volume and slightly more prices, as price inflation normalizes. And so I think that 2% is still pretty good number.\n It's certainly been the average growth rate in volume. If you take a compound number over the last number of years, you're going to get something like a 2%. So that seems to be the momentum we're driving. And that -- if you strip away the inflation and the weirdness in the first quarter, what you see is, you got that 1% volume, which given the Middle East headwind of 1% and actually recycling the strongest quarter last year, you can say it's a good volume number. It has good underlying price/mix in the normal countries. So the kind of the normal performance is right at the top end of the algorithm there, and then that feeds its way through to 7% EPS growth. So I think right in there, the main business, notwithstanding the kind of peripheral noise, is humming away right in line with where we said we wanted to be. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore ISI. \nRobert Ottenstein: I'd just like to drill down both on the U.S. and the volume question. Can you talk about your expectations for volume growth in North America this year? What it will take to get volume growth, is a function of more the economy, more the comps, more of the sectors? And tied to the sectors or categories, I think you mentioned that tea, coffee and water were very weak. Any color around that? \nJames Quincey: Sure. I mean, clearly, in the case of the U.S., we've commented in previous calls, that our expectation would be modest, flat to modest growth in volume on a long-term basis in North America with good pricing. Clearly, that remains our overall ambition. Whether we get from the flat to something more positive in the rest of the year will obviously be a combination of what we execute against and the trajectory of the purchasing power of the economy in the balance of the year. But we're very focused on continuing to build the business, drive the revenue and continue to win in the marketplace. And we'll see where that nets out, too.\n And then in the case of where we were doing well and where not clearly, we had a strong quarter in terms of sparkling, in terms of some of the other categories in North America. Dairy, obviously, the fairlife additional charge, as John talked about, as the earnout is in its last year, very strong quarter on dairy, very strong on sparkling, actually good on juice. \n The water and the tea, and obviously, to some extent, obviously, the sports categories, were a little softer. Some of it on the water was selling less of the kind of the case pack water. And tea, I think it was very much a question, we just need to focus a little more on some of what needs to be done there. But it was more on the kind of the Fuze Tea end of the spectrum rather than the Gold Peak end of the spectrum, which tends to do better. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Callum Elliott from Bernstein. \nCallum Elliott: Great. So I have a slightly longer-term question on gross margins. In 2015, your gross margin was 61%, I think. And you had published a slide at CAGNY in 2016, showing that you expected gross margins to get to 68%, post the refranchising that had been announced at the time. Today, we're still around 60% over the past 12 months. Recognizing you guys weren't in your current seats in 2016 when that slide was published, but my question is what's happened? \n I'm sure you'll point to M&A cost per BODYARMOR CCBA, et cetera, but I don't think they come close to explaining the 800 basis points of delta and I don't think that FX explains the gap either. But so what else is it? And has refranchising maybe just has not been as margin accretive as you expected? Or is there some kind of other structural drag that haven't been anticipated back in 2016? \nJohn Murphy: Yes. Actually, I think it does explain what's happened. I don't have the breakdown in front of me. But at the gross margin level, when you take into account the impact of currency, of some of the bottlers acquisitions that came back into our portfolio, that we're now in the process of refranchising and some of the other acquisitions, I think they have had a mechanical impact. And we can come back with a little bit more color on that. And then I think when you look at the operating income and how it flows down into operating income line, the primary driver are these items. So yes, I don't have it in front of me. We can follow up in a bit more detail. But yes, that's the story. \nOperator: Our last question will come from Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge Research. \nBrett Cooper: Just wanted to ask on your digital experience in B2B. And if you do any quantification as to when you win B2B or you get B2B into more particular retailers? What happens to your space, your share of the category performance and its relative to a base? I think it's not so much a question of the 8% increase in the quarter, but looking back over time. \nJames Quincey: I don't know if something was up with the line today that was very kind of broken up. But I think, Brett, you were asking about the digital experiences in B2B and what happens in shares in the category. There are multiple -- B2B is not a singular thing and the digital version of B2B is not a singular thing. There is a vast amount of B2B business that has been done for many years with direct order transfers, largely to large store modern retailers where order replenishment has a long-standing track record. And this is really focused on the efficiency of making sure the shelf is not out of stock from products. And it's more a process of support to what already goes on. And so actually, you see it's enabling the physical presence in the kind of the analog world, if you like.\n Of course, there's other types of B2B, for example, in the mom-and-pop stores, where we have moved heavily from a you have to wait for the pre-seller to appear type of relationship with the mom-and-pop stores to where that is complemented by some sort of ordering and relationship platform. They come in multiple guises, depending on where you are in the world, and the relative need and cost efficiency of doing so. But those platforms allow retailers effectively to be able to order, make additional orders 24/7, maybe even book servicing for their cold drink equipment, follow loyalty programs, et cetera, et cetera. So there's a lot of different types of B2B relationships.\n Generally speaking, they are supportive of us continuing to grow the relationship and to continue to do well. And -- but they are enabling rather than consumer facing, so the kind of the share is a little trickier to determine.\n Okay. I think that was the last one. To summarize, first quarter of the year, strong start, and we're confident we can continue to create value for the stakeholders and shareowners and deliver on our 2024 guidance. We'll continue to manage through the many different types of environments out there, but focus on leveraging our capabilities to drive what we can control to make sure we get growth.\n So thank you for your interest, your investment in the company and joining us this morning. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."}]}
